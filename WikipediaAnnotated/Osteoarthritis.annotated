is
a group|261586004|160481000|389109008
of mechanical abnormalities|107658001
involving|248448006
degradation|40091007
of joints,|39352004|81087007
[1]|260305007
including|55919000
articular cartilage|41052006|305026006
and
subchondral bone.|272673000|3138006|90780006|128530007

Symptoms
may
include|55919000
joint pain,|57676002
tenderness,|247348008
stiffness,|271587009
locking
,
and
sometimes
an effusion.|41699000|430869004

A variety
of causes?hereditary, developmental, metabolic,|134198009|255404009|278923009
and
mechanical?|261018001
may
initiate
processes|415178003
leading|236874000
to loss
of cartilage.|61496007

When
bone surfaces|272673000|410678000|3138006|410678000|90780006|410678000|128530007|410678000
become
less well|276139006|20572008|263796003|20572008
protected
by cartilage,|61496007
bone|272673000|3138006|90780006|128530007
may
be
exposed|24932003
and
damaged.|37782003

As a result|394617004
of decreased movement|1250004|255324009|260400001|255324009|260371004|255324009
secondary|2603003|81170007
to pain,|22253000
regional muscles|410673009|91727004|255470001|91727004
may
atrophy,|13331008
and
ligaments|52082005
may
become
more lax.[2]|242762006|12554006

Treatment generally|276239002|416118004
involves|248448006
a combination|89780004
of exercise,|61686008
lifestyle modification,|60134006|243326001
and
analgesics.|373265006

If pain|22253000
becomes
debilitating,
joint replacement surgery|112698002|3137001|112698002|282089006|61557004|83578000
may
be
used|394850002
to
improve|385425000|3442003|385633008
the quality|263496004
of life.|224130005

OA|396275006
is
the most common form|4757001|72906007|246176004
of arthritis,|3723001
[2]|260306008
and
the leading cause|236874000|134198009
of chronic disability|90734009|21134002
in the United States.|223688001

It
affects|4065008
about 8 million people|125676002
in the United Kingdom|223860005
and
nearly 27 million people|125676002
in the United States._[citation|223688001
needed|410525008|103325001
_]

The main symptom|63161005
is
pain,|22253000
causing|23981006
loss
of ability|371150009
and
often stiffness.|70232002|271587009

"Pain"|22253000
is
generally
described
as a sharp ache,|410707003|410711009
or
a burning sensation|90673000
in the
associate|47429007
muscles|91727004
and
tendons.|13024002

OA|396275006
can
cause|23981006|134198009
a crackling noise|48409008
(called "crepitus"|64205004
)
when
the affected joint|247591002|39352004|247591002|81087007|247591002|302536002|248448006|39352004|248448006|81087007|248448006|302536002
is
moved|384598002|370125004
or
touched,|386476006|52962008|397624008
and
patients|116154003
may
experience
muscle spasm|45352006
and
contractions|78558002
in the tendons.|13024002

Occasionally,
the joints|39352004|81087007
may
also
be
filled
with fluid.|32457005|33463005|255765007

Humid|17461003
and
cold weather|45893009
increases|260366006
the pain|22253000
in many patients.[4][5]|116154003

OA commonly|396275006
affects|4065008
the hands,|85562004
feet,|56459004|259051005
spine,|421060004|44300000|243930007
and
the large weight bearing joints,|255509001|249981005|39352004|255509001|249981005|81087007
such as the hips|29836001
and
knees,|304679005
although
in theory,
any joint|39352004|81087007|302536002
in the body|279495008|123037004
can
be
affected.|247591002|248448006

As OA progresses,|396275006|385651009
the affected joints|247591002|39352004|247591002|81087007|248448006|39352004|248448006|81087007
appear
larger,|255509001|263768009
are
stiff
and
painful,|22253000
and
usually
feel|285854004
better|3442003
with gentle use|277889008|419385000
but
worse|230993007|390772001|231877006
with excessive|260378005
or
prolonged use,|255224006|277889008|255224006|419385000
thus
distinguishing
it
from rheumatoid arthritis.|69896004

In smaller joints,|263796003|39352004|263796003|81087007|255507004|39352004|255507004|81087007
such as
at the fingers,|7569003|259052003
hard bony enlargements,|72505002|263686003|56246009
called Heberden's nodes|371598009
(
on the distal interphalangeal joints|46053002|416599001
and/or
Bouchard's nodes|20243008
(
on the proximal interphalangeal joints|40415009|416599001
)
,
may
form|246176004
,
and
though
they
are
not necessarily painful,|22253000
they
do
limit|255469002
the movement|255324009
of the fingers significantly.|7569003|259052003

OA|396275006
at the toes|29707007
leads|88488004|236874000
to the formation|11798007|255277001
of bunions,|415692008
rendering
them red|386713009|371240000
or
swollen.|442672001

Some people|125676002
notice
these physical changes|5880005|243326001|5880005|263703002|19388002|243326001|19388002|263703002
before
they
experience
any pain.|22253000

OA|396275006
is
the most common cause|4757001|72906007|134198009
of joint effusion,|387637008
sometimes
called
_water|11713004|119318008
on the knee_ in lay terms,|304679005|40199007|304679005|255576009|49076000|40199007|49076000|255576009|361291001|40199007|361291001|255576009|72696002|40199007|72696002|255576009
an accumulation
of excess fluid|423666004|21639008
in
or
around the knee joint.[6]|49076000|182204005

Some investigators
believe
that mechanical stress|285655001
on joints|39352004|81087007
underlies|255546002
all osteoarthritis,|396275006
with many|260396001
and
varied sources|260753009
of mechanical stress,|285655001
including|55919000
misalignments|399898009
of bones|272673000|128530007
caused|23981006|134198009
by congenital|6160004|255399007
or
pathogenic causes|264418008|134198009
;
mechanical injury|261018001
;
overweight|238131007
;
loss
of strength|260404005
in muscles|91727004
supporting|9096001|243114000
joints|39352004|81087007
;
and
impairment|40226000
of peripheral nerves,|84782009
leading|236874000
to sudden|255363002
or
uncoordinated movements|281016006|255324009
that
overstress
joints.|39352004|81087007

However
exercise|61686008
,
including|55919000
running|418060005
in the absence|2667000|418560003
of injury,
has
not
been
found|404684003
to
increase|260366006
one's risk|421379005|30207005
of developing osteoarthritis.|396275006

Nor
has
cracking ones|421379005
knuckles|70420003
been
found|404684003
to
play|300776002
a role.[9]

Primary osteoarthritis|239862000|201819000
is
a chronic degenerative disorder|27624003|33359002|90734009|362975008
related|272151006|262094002
to
but
not
caused|23981006|134198009
by aging,|248280005
as
there
are
people well|125676002|20572008
into their nineties
who
have
no clinical|58147004
or
functional signs|40143009|72670004|246464006|72670004
of the disease.|64572001

As a person ages,|125676002|424144002
the water content|11713004|276824008|119318008|276824008
of the cartilage decreases[10]|61496007|260370003
as a result|394617004
of a reduced proteoglycan content,|260400001|79375003|276824008
thus
causing|23981006
the cartilage to|61496007
be
less resilient.|276139006|263796003

Without the protective effects|253861007
of the proteoglycans,|79375003
the collagen fibers|62183001
of the cartilage|61496007
can
become
susceptible|131196009
to degradation|40091007
and
thus
exacerbate|162473008
the degeneration.|33359002

Inflammation|257552002
of the surrounding joint capsule|355648006|32551008
can
also
occur|272120004
,
though
often mild|70232002|255604002
(
compared
to what
occurs|272120004
in rheumatoid arthritis|69896004
).

This
can
happen
as breakdown products|40091007|125366008
from the cartilage|61496007
are
released|68776005|129299003
into the synovial space,
and
the cells|4421005
lining|50009006
the joint attempt to|39352004|81087007|302536002
remove|127485006
them.

New bone outgrowths,|7147002|416189003
called "
spurs|49620009
"
or
osteophytes,|80400009|88998003
can
form|246176004
on the margins|112233002|82868003|372249001
of the joints,|39352004|81087007
possibly|60022001
in an attempt to
improve|385425000|3442003|385633008
the congruence|255332001
of the articular cartilage surfaces.|41052006|410678000|305026006|410678000

These bone changes,|272673000|243326001|272673000|263703002|3138006|243326001|3138006|263703002|90780006|243326001|90780006|263703002|128530007|243326001|128530007|263703002
together with the inflammation,|257552002
can
be
both
painful|22253000
and
debilitating.

A number|410680006|410681005
of studies|110465008|224699009
have
shown
that there
is
a greater prevalence|263768009
of the disease|64572001
among siblings|375005
and
especially identical twins,|313415001
indicating|410535002
a hereditary basis.|255404009|255404009|418836005

Up to 60%
of OA cases|396275006|398241000|396275006|413769002
are
thought|88952004
to
result|394617004
from genetic factors.|3950001|255395001

Both
primary generalized nodal OA|396275006|60132005|263820005
and
erosive OA|255304005|396275006
(EOA.

also
called
inflammatory OA|396275006
)
are
sub-sets|261089000|118555000
of primary OA.|396275006

EOA
is
a much less common,|242762006|72906007|4757001|72906007
and
more aggressive inflammatory form|242762006|61372001|246176004|242762006|246176004
of OA|396275006
which often|70232002
affects|4065008
the distal interphalangeal joints|46053002|416599001
and
has
characteristic changes|243326001|263703002
on x-ray.|52250000|168537006|363680008

This type|261664005
of OA|396275006
is
caused|23981006|134198009
by other factors|74964007
but
the resulting pathology|42752001|394595002
is
the same|262126009
as for primary OA|396275006
:

Diagnosis|439401001
is
made
with reasonable certainty|410666004|17162000
based|418836005
on history|392521001
and
clinical examination.|5880005

X-rays|52250000|168537006
may
confirm|59156000
the diagnosis.|439401001

The typical changes|243326001|263703002
seen
on X-ray|52250000|168537006|363680008
include|55919000
:
joint space narrowing,|36668004|25659002|36668004|134223000
subchondral sclerosis|43846000
(increased bone formation|102553006
around the joint|39352004|81087007|302536002
)
,
subchondral cyst formation,|441457006|11798007|441457006|255277001|103552005|11798007|103552005|255277001
and
osteophytes.|80400009|88998003

Plain films|168537006
may
not
correlate
with the findings|404684003
on physical examination|5880005
or
with the degree|258395000|246173007
of pain.|22253000

Usually other imaging techniques|278395004
are
not necessary to clinically
diagnose|439401001
osteoarthritis.|396275006

In 1990,
the American College of Rheumatology,|224864007|394810000|224864007|45440000
using|260676000
data
from a multi-center study,|260396001|26216008|110465008|260396001|26216008|224699009
developed
a set
of criteria
for the diagnosis|439401001
of hand osteoarthritis|22193007|239869009
based|418836005
on hard tissue enlargement|72505002|85756007|56246009|72505002|85756007|118452000|72505002|85756007|442021009
and
swelling|423666004|442672001
of certain joints.|17162000|39352004|17162000|81087007

These criteria
were
found|404684003
to
be
92% sensitive|83185005
and
98% specific|69658003
for hand osteoarthritis|22193007|239869009
versus
other entities|74964007
such as rheumatoid arthritis|69896004
and
spondyloarthropathies.[16]|372109003

Related pathologies|272151006|394595002|262094002|394595002

has
been
shown
to

to NSAIDs|372665008
alone|105529008

with hip OA.[19]|239872002

For most people|125676002
with OA,|396275006
graded exercise|258349007|61686008|371469007|61686008

be
the mainstay
of their
self-management.|413454004|119270007

Moderate exercise|6736007|61686008

limited.[20]|255469002

There
is
sufficient evidence to|51117008|18669006
indicate|410535002
that physical interventions|5880005|225334002|19388002|225334002

for OA.|396275006

For mild to moderate symptoms effectiveness|371923003|255403003
is
similar
to non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs),|372665008
though
for more severe symptoms NSAIDs|242762006|162470006|372665008

be
more effective.|242762006|255403003|242762006|254648000

NSAIDs|372665008

are
associated|47429007

Another class|258391009
of NSAIDs,|372665008
COX-2 selective inhibitors|387050005

but
higher rates|75540009|371879000
of cardiovascular disease|49601007

They
have
fewer systemic side-effects|57176003|31099001

at least
some therapeutic effect.|262202000|253861007

While
opioid analgesic
such as morphine|373529000|442759006

fentanyl|373492002
improve|385425000|3442003|385633008
pain|22253000
this benefit
is
outweighed
by frequent adverse events|70232002|272379006

not
recommended

Controversy
surrounds|355648006
glucosamine.|408111007

A 2010 meta-analysis|272389005
has
found|404684003
that
it
is
no better|3442003
than placebo.

Some older reviews|70753007
conclude
that glucosamine sulfate|408111007|95975008
was
an effective treatment[43][44]|255403003|276239002|255403003|416118004|254648000|276239002|254648000|416118004
while
some others|74964007
have
found|404684003
it ineffective.

A difference|263735002
has
been
found|404684003
between trials|110465008
involving|248448006
glucosamine sulfate|408111007|95975008
and
glucosamine hydrochloride,|412189001
with glucosamine sulfate|408111007|95975008
showing
a benefit
and
glucosamine hydrochloride|412189001
not.

The Osteoarthritis Research Society International (OARSI)|396275006
recommends
that glucosamine|408111007
be
discontinued|410546004
if
no effect|253861007

observed
after six months.[47]|422218008|258706009

Osteoarthritis|396275006
affects|4065008
nearly 27 million people|125676002

for 25%
of visits
to primary care physicians,|446050000
and
half
of all NSAID prescriptions.|372665008|260885003

It
is
estimated|414135002
that 80%
of the population|385436007|389109008

radiographic evidence|258106000|18669006

symptoms.

In the United States,|223688001
hospitalizations|394656005
for osteoarthritis|396275006

Osteoarthritis|396275006
is
derived
from the Greek word part _osteo-_,|1451003|255373000|260726005
meaning|255586005
"
of the bone",|272673000|3138006|90780006|128530007
combined|89780004
with _arthritis_|3723001
:
_arthr-_,
meaning|255586005
"joint",|39352004|81087007|302536002
and
_-itis_,
the meaning
of which
has
come
to
be
associated|47429007
with inflammation.|257552002

The _-itis_
of osteoarthritis|396275006
could
be
considered
misleading
as inflammation|257552002
is
not
a conspicuous feature.

Some clinicians
refer|439980006
to this condition|260905004
as
_osteoarthosis_ to
signify
the lack|41277001
of inflammatory response.
