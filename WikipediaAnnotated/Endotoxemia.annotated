The term
*
*endotoxin|18127008
*
*
was
coined
by Nats Umangay,
who
distinguished
between exotoxin,|29750002
which
he
classified|73504009
as a toxin|80917008
that
is
released|68776005|129299003
by bacteria|409822003
into the environment,|276339004
and
endotoxin,|18127008
which
he
considered to
be
a toxin|80917008
kept
"
within"
the bacterial cell|285297004
and
to
be
released|68776005|129299003
only
after
destruction|64597002
of the bacterial cell wall.|285297004|224727009

Today,
the term 'endotoxin'|18127008
is
used synonymously|394850002
with the term lipopolysaccharide_[citation|3325005
needed|410525008|103325001
_],
which
is
a major constituent|255603008|312297002
of the outer cell membrane|261074009|53982002
of Gram-negative bacteria.|81325006

Larger amounts|255509001|107651007|263768009|107651007
of endotoxins|18127008
can
be
mobilized|183376001|302044006
if Gram-negative bacteria|81325006
are
killed|248007002
or
destroyed
by detergents.|264299001

The term "endotoxin"|18127008
came
from the discovery
that portions|260726005
of Gram-negative bacteria|81325006
themselves
can
cause|23981006|134198009
toxicity,
hence
the name endotoxin.|18127008

Studies|110465008|224699009
of endotoxin|18127008
over the next 50 years|18769003|258707000|255260001|258707000
revealed|263857004
that
the effects|253861007
of "endotoxin"|18127008
are
,
in fact,
due to lipopolysaccharide.|3325005

The key effects|253861007
of endotoxins|18127008
on vertebrates|387967000
are
mediated|73510009
by their interaction
with specific receptors|69658003|116647005
on immune cells|255386009|4421005
such as monocytes,|55918008|67776007
macrophages,|58986001
dendritic cells,
and
others.|74964007

Upon challenge
with endotoxin,|18127008
these cells|4421005
form|246176004
a broad spectrum|90522003
of immune mediators|255386009
such as cytokines,|75777003
nitric oxide,|409378005
and
eicosanoids.[1]|418534004

The prototypical examples
of endotoxin|18127008
are
lipopolysaccharide (LPS)|3325005
or
lipooligosaccharide (LOS),
found|404684003
in the outer membrane|261074009|83097008
of various Gram-negative bacteria,|256220008|81325006
and
are
an important component|246093002
of their ability to|371150009
cause|23981006|134198009
disease.|64572001

The term LPS|3325005|79261008
is
often|70232002
used interchangeably|394850002
with endotoxin,|18127008
owing to its historical discovery.|392521001

LPS|3325005|79261008
consists
of a polysaccharide|71544008
(sugar) chain|2331003|46666003|74801000|46666003
and
a lipid moiety,|70106000
known|36692007
as lipid A,|70106000
which
is
responsible|394851003
for the toxic effects.

The polysaccharide chain|71544008|46666003
is
highly variable|75540009|255372005
among different bacteria|263735002|409822003
and
determines
their serotype.|276770009

Endotoxins|18127008
are
approximately 10 kDa|26175008|414556008
in size|277049003
but
can
form|246176004
large aggregates|255509001|18403000
up to 1000 kDa.|414556008

Humans|278412004
are
able to|371150009
produce
antibodies|68498002
against endotoxins|18127008
after exposure,|71677004|24932003
but
these
are
,
in general,|60132005
directed|255589003
at the polysaccharide chain|71544008|46666003
and
can
only
protect
against the immunoactivation
from serotype-specific bacteria|276770009|69658003|409822003
and/or
their specific endotoxin.|69658003|18127008

Injection|28289002|385218009|129326001
of a small amount|255507004|107651007
of endotoxin|18127008
in human volunteers|278412004|160772005
has
been
shown
to
produce
fever,|386661006
a decrease|260400001|260370003
in blood pressure,|75367002|392570002|386536003
and
activation
of inflammation|257552002
and
coagulation.|129390001

Endotoxins|18127008
are
in large part|255509001|260726005
responsible|394851003
for the dramatic clinical manifestations|58147004|250255003|58147004|251190009
of infections
with pathogenic Gram-negative bacteria,|264418008|81325006
such as _Neisseria meningitidis_,|17872004
the pathogens|264418008
that
causes|134198009
meningococcal disease,|23511006
including|55919000
meningococcemia,|4089001
Waterhouse-Friderichsen syndrome,|36102002
and
meningitis.|7180009

Results|394617004
from one 1979 study|421379005|110465008|421379005|224699009
indicated|410535002
that _Listeria monocytogenes_|36094007
may
produce
an "endotoxin-|18127008
like" substance.|105590001

However,
a subsequent study|255260001|110465008|255260001|224699009
failed
to
confirm|59156000
that
this Gram-positive species|258682000|258758003|69658003|258682000|10828004|69658003
produces
an endotoxin.[4]|18127008

_Bacillus thuringiensis_|64840009
is
known to|36692007
produce
an endotoxin|18127008
called
_delta endotoxin_.|261003002|18127008

The expression|10012005
of the toxin|80917008
in plants|31006001
is
known to|36692007
offer|410527000
the plants resistance|31006001|30714006
against various insects._[citation|256220008|106763003

Endotoxins|18127008
are
toxins|80917008
that
are
not
secreted
by cells,|4421005
so
they
can
be
found|404684003
within the cell|4421005|362837007
and
not
in the surrounding medium.|355648006|255508009

Toxins|80917008
secreted
are
exotoxins.|29750002

The delta endotoxin|261003002|18127008
of _Bacillus thuringiensis_|64840009
is
a protein|88878007
found|404684003
in crystal-|250448002|264297004|413935006
like inclusion bodies next to|279495008|18769003|123037004|18769003
the endospore|46994008
inside the bacteria.|409822003

It
is
toxic
to larvae
of insects|106763003
feeding|129007004
on plants,|31006001
but
is
harmless
to humans|278412004
as humans|278412004
do
not
possess
the enzymes|90668006
and
receptors|116647005
necessary
for its processing
and
toxicity.

In humans,|278412004
LPS|3325005|79261008
binds|257768005
to the lipopolysaccharide-binding protein (LBP)|3325005|304372009
in the serum,|67922002
which
transfers|302265009
it
to CD14
on the cell membrane,|53982002
which in turn|282987006
transfers|302265009
it
to another non-anchored protein,|122502001|88878007
MD2,
which
associates|47429007
with the homodimeric Toll-like receptor-4|116647005
(TLR4.

CD14
and
TLR4
are
present|52101004|246105001
in several immune system cells|261028005|116003000|4421005
(
including|55919000
macrophages|58986001
and
dendritic cells,
triggering|410658008
the signaling cascade|38952000
for macrophage/endothelial cells to|58986001|45709008
secrete
pro-inflammatory cytokines|52541003|75777003
and
nitric oxide|409378005
that lead|88488004
to "endotoxic shock".|371769008

Further components|46053002|246093002
of the gram-negative cell wall|258682000|260385009|4421005|224727009|258682000|260385009|362837007|224727009
may
also
activate
other pathways,|74964007
which
may
contribute
to the overall endotoxic effect.|18127008|253861007

Endotoxins|18127008
are
frequent contaminants|70232002
in plasmid DNA|373944006|24851008
prepared
from bacteria|409822003
or
proteins|88878007

Also,
ovalbumin|303301007
is
frequently|70232002
contaminated|62604006
with endotoxins.|18127008

Ovalbumin|303301007
is
one|421379005
of the extensively studied proteins|88878007
in animal models|387961004
and
also
an established model allergen for airway hyper-responsiveness (AHR).|263748003|90260006|43725001|44548000|80074009|263748003|90260006|89187006|44548000|80074009|385645004|90260006|43725001|44548000|80074009|385645004|90260006|89187006|44548000|80074009

Commercially available ovalbumin|103328004|303301007
that
is
contaminated|62604006
with LPS|3325005|79261008
can
fully
activate
endothelial cells|45709008

of the first step|255216001|398298007|232714002|398298007
of inflammation,|257552002
and
it
falsifies
research results,|394617004
as
it
does
not accurately
reflect|225436004
the effect|253861007
of sole protein antigen|57999000|115256001
on animal physiology.|387961004|1360005

In pharmaceutical production,|421967003
it
is
necessary to
remove|127485006
all traces|260405006
of endotoxin|18127008
from drug product containers,|398124009
as
even small amounts|255507004|107651007
of endotoxin|18127008
will
cause|23981006|134198009
illness|39104002
in humans.|278412004

A depyrogenation oven|80950008
is
used|394850002
for this purpose.|363675004

Temperatures|246508008
in excess|260378005
of 300?C
are
required
to break down|263690001
this substance.|105590001

A defined endotoxin reduction rate|18127008|58294000|18127008|260400001|18127008|289928003
is
a correlation
between time|410669006
and
temperature.|105723007|246508008

Based|418836005
on primary packaging material|63161005|260769002|261424001|260769002
as syringes|61968008|75797008
or
vials,|415818006
a glass temperature|32039001|105723007|32039001|246508008
of 250?C
and
a holding time|421139008|410669006
of 30 minutes|259030007
is
typical to
achieve
a reduction|58294000|260400001|289928003
of endotoxin levels|18127008|258395000
by a factor
of 1000.

A very sensitive assay|260358002|83185005|58779000|260358002|83185005|272392009
for detecting presence|260373001|386397008
of endotoxin|18127008
is
the Limulus Amebocyte Lysate assay,|73568005|58779000|73568005|272392009
utilizing
blood|87612001|119273009
from the Horseshoe crab.|261369006|420975000|261369006|45776000|261369006|230029001

Very low levels|260362008|258395000
of LPS|3325005|79261008
can
cause|23981006|134198009
coagulation|129390001
of the limulus lysate
due to a powerful amplification|33300005
through an enzymatic cascade.|90668006

Another method|260686004|272394005
is
the EndoLISA,
which
uses|277889008|394850002|260676000|419385000
phage proteins to|67068001|88878007
bind|257768005
the endotoxin|18127008
to a microtiter plate.|271003

Potentially interfering components|78235001|246093002
are
then completely
removed|127485006
by a washing step.|398298007

The endotoxin|18127008
is
subsequenty
detected|260373001
by recombinant Factor C (rFC).

In contrast
to the LAL assay,|58779000|272392009
no animal source|387961004|260753009
is
used.|394850002

Endotoxins|18127008
cause|23981006|134198009
severe diseases|24484000|64572001
in human beings.|278412004

The presence|386397008
of endotoxins|18127008
in the blood|87612001|119273009
is
called endotoxemia.|371770009

It
can
lead|88488004
to septic shock,|76571007
if
the immune response|35024006
is
severely|24484000
pronounced.[6]

Moreover,
endotoxemia|371770009
of intestinal origin|261093006|255395001
is
considered to
be
an important factor
in the development|278923009
of alcoholic hepatitis,|235875008
[7]
which
is
likely to|2931005
develop
on the basis|418836005
of the small bowel bacterial overgrowth syndrome|446081009
and
an increased intestinal permeability.[8]|35105006|261093006|82540007|260366006|261093006|82540007
