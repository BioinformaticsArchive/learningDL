is
a disease|64572001
of camels|423870005
caused|23981006|134198009
by a virus|49872002
of the family _Poxviridae_,|424976006
subfamily Chordopoxvirinae,|424428001
and
the genus _Orthopoxvirus_.|29724001

It
causes|134198009
skin lesions|95324001
and
a generalized infection.|60132005

Approximately 25%|26175008
of young camels|84422007|423870005
that
become
infected
will
die|419620001|399069006|419099009
from the disease,|64572001
while
infection
in older camels|70753007|423870005
is
generally more mild.|255604002

Although
rare,|84638005|103356009
the infection
may
spread|410677005
to the hands|85562004
of those
that
work|261041009
closely
with camels.[2]|423870005

Camelpox|34278007
is
endemic
throughout the Middle East,|223605000
Africa,|223498002
and
Asia.|223500001

The Camelpox Virus (CMPV)|63529002
that
causes|134198009
Camelpox|34278007
is
an Orthopoxvirus|29724001
that
is
very closely|260358002
related|272151006|262094002
to the Vaccinia virus|13126002
that
causes|134198009
Smallpox.|67924001|243568000

It
is
a large, brick-shaped,|255509001|107644003|255509001|300842002
enveloped
virus|49872002
that ranges
in size|277049003
from 265-295 nm.

The viral genetic material|256926007
is
contained|42504009
in double stranded linear DNA|13925004|50009006
consisting
of 202,182 tightly packed base pairs.|53999001

The DNA|24851008
is
encased
in the viral core.|115426007

Two lateral bodies|420797005|49370004|279495008|420797005|49370004|123037004
are
found|404684003
outside the viral core,|115426007
and
are
believed
to
hold|421139008
the enzymes|90668006
required
for viral reproduction.[4]|263767004

The Camelpox virus most often|63529002|70232002
affects|4065008
members|394852005
of family Camelidae.|107000002

However,
recent studies|6493001|110465008|6493001|224699009
show
that
the disease|64572001
can
be
transmitted|60117003|258150004
to
both
humans|278412004
and
arthropods.[5]|106762008

The Camelpox virus|63529002
is
spread|410677005
in three ways|421291004
:
direct contact,|255589003|11723008|255589003|70862002
indirect contact,|255541007|11723008|255541007|70862002
and
insect vectors.|106763003|260529001

In direct contact infection,|255589003|11723008|255589003|70862002
a camel|423870005
becomes
infected
after direct contact|255589003|11723008|255589003|70862002
with an infected camel.|423870005

In indirect contact infection,|255541007|11723008|255541007|70862002
a camel|423870005
becomes
infected
after contact|11723008|70862002
with an infected environment.|276339004

The virus|49872002
is
spread|410677005
through milk,|3718001|119321005|70813002
saliva,|256897009
ocular secretions,|81745001|46242002|281004000|46242002|46242002
and
nasal secretions,|260540009|46242002|46242002
and
has
been
shown
to
remain
virulent
outside of a host
for 4 months.[6]|260308009|258706009

The Camelpox virus|63529002
has
been
isolated|46651001
from camel ticks|423870005|423870005|106831000
(Hyalomma dromedarii|14656000
)
removed|127485006
from infected animals.|387961004

It
is
believed
that
the ticks|106831000
can
transmit|60117003
the disease|64572001
from camel|423870005
to camel.|423870005

This theory
is
supported|9096001|243114000
by increases|260366006
in Camelpox infections immediately|34278007|49499008
following|255260001
heavy rains,|410712002
during which
the camel tick population|423870005|385436007|423870005|389109008
increases|260366006
greatly.[7]

Transmission|258150004
of Camelpox|34278007
to humans|278412004
was
confirmed|59156000
in 2009
when
camel herders|423870005
in India|223600005
presented|246105001
with infections
of the hands|85562004
and
fingers.|7569003|259052003

Although
other cases|74964007|398241000|74964007|413769002
of human infection|278412004
have
been
reported|229059009|223458004
,
no other cases|74964007|398241000|74964007|413769002
have
been
verified.

Due to the close contact|29179001|11723008|29179001|70862002
between camels|423870005
and
their human handlers|278412004
in much|242762006|4757001
of the world,
it
is
believed
that Camelpox|34278007
is
transmitted|60117003|258150004
to humans|278412004
via direct contact.[8]|255589003|11723008|255589003|70862002

The Orthopox virus|29724001
that
causes|134198009
Camelpox|34278007
behaves
very similarly|260358002
to the virus|49872002
that
causes|134198009
Smallpox.|67924001|243568000

After the virus attaches|49872002|102491009|102491009
to a host cell,|4421005|362837007
it
injects|422145002
its viral core|115426007
(
the shell|44537007
containing|42504009
its DNA|24851008
)
into the cell's cytoplasm.|4421005|362837007

The virus|49872002
carries|288345009
DNA polymerase|36387003
which
is
used to|394850002
transcribe
its genes.|67271001

Eventually,
the viral core dissolves,|115426007|421682005
and
the genetic material|256926007
is
bare
within the cytoplasm.

When
all
of the structural proteins|304381003
have
been
produced
,
viral assembly
takes|419652001
place.|257557008|421066005

The newly formed virus particles|35810008|285296008
can
be
released|68776005|129299003
during cell lysis,|4421005|371757000|4421005|239551005|362837007|371757000|362837007|239551005
or
they
can
derive
a host cell|4421005|362837007
produced
membrane|83097008
and
be
released|68776005|129299003
via budding.[9]

The incubation period|406646006
of Camelpox|34278007
is
between 3|260313008
and
15 days.|258703001

The resulting infection|42752001
can
be
classified|73504009
as acute|272118002
or
generalized.|60132005

Generalized infections|60132005
are
usually
found|404684003
in camels|423870005
over the age|424144002
of three,|421291004
and
are
characterized
by swollen lymph nodes,|30746006
fever,|386661006
and
the development|278923009
of skin lesions.|95324001

The lesions
begin|255395001
as papules,|443871003
but
develop
into pustules.|271760008

These external symptoms usually|261074009
begin|255395001
on the head|69536005|302548004
and
neck,|45048000|302550007
but
eventually
spread|410677005
throughout the body,|279495008|123037004
being
especially
concentrated
on the limbs|66019005
and
genitalia.

Without treatment,|276239002|416118004
the animal|387961004
will
generally
recover|74822006
from the infection
in 4|260308009
to 6 weeks.[6]|260272008|258705008

Acute infections|63171007
are
usually
found|404684003
in camels|423870005
under the age|424144002
of three,|421291004
and
result|394617004
in mild|255604002
to severe systemic infections.|24484000|91302008

In addition|260364009
to the symptoms
that accompany
a generalized infection,|60132005
these animals|387961004
experience
internal lesions|260521003
along the lining|50009006
of the mouth,|74262004|123851003|21082005|181220002
and
respiratory|258162000|449071006
and
digestive tracts.|122865005

They also
experience
loss
of appetite|33911006
and
diarrhea.|398032003

A large proportion|255509001|8212001
of camels acutely|423870005
infected
with Camelpox|34278007
die|419620001|399069006|419099009
,
although
death|419620001|268923008
is
often|70232002
attributed|246061005
to a secondary infection.[10]|264569006

Camelpox infections|34278007
in humans|278412004
result|394617004
in mild skin lesions|255604002|95324001
on the hands|85562004
and
fingers.|7569003|259052003

Reports|229059009|223458004
have
been
made
that
the lesions
can
be
found|404684003
on the mouth|74262004|123851003|21082005|181220002
and
lips|261114002
if
the patient drank milk|116154003|160573003|3718001|116154003|160573003|119321005|116154003|160573003|70813002|116154003|25702006|3718001|116154003|25702006|119321005|116154003|25702006|70813002|116154003|86933000|3718001|116154003|86933000|119321005|116154003|86933000|70813002|116154003|3718001|116154003|119321005|116154003|70813002|116154003|226465004|3718001|116154003|226465004|119321005|116154003|226465004|70813002|116154003|30953006|3718001|116154003|30953006|119321005|116154003|30953006|70813002
from an infected camel,|423870005
but
these symptoms
have
not
been
confirmed.[8]|59156000

Camelpox diagnosis|34278007|439401001|34278007
can
be
based|418836005
on symptoms.

However,
both
Camel Contagious Ecthyma|423870005|74050005
and
Camel Papillomatosis|423870005
cause|23981006|134198009
indistinguishable symptoms
under similar conditions.|260905004

Therefore,
the best way to
diagnose|439401001
Camelpox|34278007
is
via Transmission Electron Microscopy evaluation|258150004|73512001|258150004|73512001|386053000
of skin samples|119325001
from infected animals.|387961004

The Camelpox virus|63529002
has
a unique
shape|107644003|246176004|300842002
that
is
readily identifiable|7882003
using|260676000
this method.|260686004|272394005

In cases|398241000|413769002
where TEM technology
is
not available, serological tests|103328004|68793005
are
available to|103328004
identify|7882003
Camelpox|34278007
as the causative agent|362944004
for infection.

Additionally,
researchers
in India|223600005
are
working|261041009
on a diagnostic polymerase chain reaction|439401001|258066000|261004008|258066000
to quickly
and
effectively
identify|7882003
the Camelpox virus.[12]|63529002

When
the Camelpox virus|63529002
is
identified|7882003
as the causative agent,|362944004
the disease|64572001
can
be
treated|28995006
with anti-viral medications.|372701006|410942007

The most common medication|4757001|72906007|410942007
used|394850002
to
treat|395077000
Camelpox|34278007
is
Cidofovir,|386894007
a broad spectrum anti-viral|90522003|372701006
that acts
by inhibiting|61511001
the viral DNA polymerase.|36387003

Cidofovir|386894007
has
proven|277025001
to
be
100% effective|255403003|254648000
at preventing death|419620001|268923008|116699007|419620001|116699007|268923008
in infected camels.[13]|423870005

Camelpox outbreaks|34278007|443684005
have
a negative effect|260385009|253861007
on the local economies.|255470001

Outbreaks often|443684005|70232002
lead|88488004
to the loss
of young camels,|84422007|423870005
and
render
older camels useless|70753007|423870005
in terms
of milk|3718001|119321005|70813002
and
meat production,|28647000
and
transportation.

As
such,
attempts
are
often|70232002
made to
prevent
transmission|258150004
of the disease.|64572001

An attenuated vaccine|24588000|398827000
is
currently available|15240007|103328004
that
provides
long term protection
against Camelpox|34278007
if
administered|418283001
when
the camel|423870005
is
at least 9 months old.|276139006|258706009|70753007|263796003|258706009|70753007

An inactivated vaccine|398827000
is
also available,|103328004
but
must
be
administered|418283001
yearly to|53281000
maintain|385630006
protection.[6]

The Camelpox virus|63529002
is
sensitive|83185005
to a number|410680006|410681005
of common disinfectants.|72906007|311942001

It
can
also
be
destroyed
by autoclaving,
short term exposure|71677004|24932003
to UV light,|41355003
and
boiling|416675009
for
at least 10 minutes.|276139006|259027000|263796003|259027000

These methods|260686004|272394005
may
be
used|394850002
by camel|423870005
herders
to
minimize
risk|30207005
of environmental contamination.[6]|102411008

In 1995 Saddam Hussein
admitted|32485007
to
having
a number|410680006|410681005
of top Iraqi scientists|421812003|27700004|308027003
working|261041009
to
turn|282987006
Camelpox|34278007
into a biological weapon.

Camelpox|34278007
was
chosen
for two main reasons|420797005|63161005|410666004
:
the theory
that
the local population|255470001|385436007|255470001|389109008
would
be
largely immune,|255386009
and
its relation|125677006
to Smallpox.|67924001|243568000

It
is
believed
that
the reported cases|229059009|398241000|229059009|413769002|223458004|398241000|223458004|413769002
of Camelpox infection|34278007
in humans|278412004
is
low|62482003|371880002
due to an immunity|58915005
gained|35105006|255396000|260366006|260369004|398092000
from exposure|71677004|24932003
to camels|423870005
during early childhood.|264499004|68433009

Therefore,
a significant proportion|386134007|8212001
of Iraq's population|223608003|385436007|223608003|389109008
would
be
immune|255386009
to Camelpox,|34278007
while
troops
from non-Camel herding countries|423870005|418788006|223369002
would
be
susceptible.|131196009

It
is
not
believed
that
the research process|415178003
was
successful,|385669000
or
that
the virus|49872002
was
ever
produced
in any great quantities.[15]|255509001|107651007|263768009|107651007
