(
taken|419652001
from Latin,
originally
meaning|255586005
_madness_,
from _
de-_
(
without
)
+ _ment_,
the root|85077000|2338009
of _mens_|339947000
(mind
)
is
a serious loss|42745003
of global cognitive ability|60132005|413384008
in a previously unimpaired person,|125676002
beyond what
might
be
expected
from normal ageing.|17621005|248280005|258744000|248280005

It
may
be
static,|257390007
the result|394617004
of a unique global brain injury,|60132005|2470005
or
progressive,|255314001
resulting|42752001
in long-term decline
due to damage|37782003
or
disease|64572001
in the body.|279495008|123037004

Although
dementia|12348006|52448006
is
far more common|46053002|72906007
in the geriatric population,|105436006|385436007|105436006|389109008
it
can
occur|272120004
before the age|424144002
of 65,|264695004
in which case|398241000
it
is
termed "early onset dementia".[1]|264499004|77374008|12348006|264499004|77374008|52448006

Dementia|12348006|52448006
is
not
a single disease,|125681006|64572001|50607009|64572001
but
a non-specific illness syndrome|10003008|39104002
(i.e.,|42146005|22971001
set
of signs|72670004
and
symptoms.

Affected cognitive areas|247591002|42798000|248448006|42798000
can
be
memory,|303116000|106136008
attention,|6769007
language,|61909002
and
problem solving.|247581008

Normally,
symptoms
must
be
present|52101004|246105001
for
at least six months to|276139006|422218008|258706009|263796003|422218008|258706009
support|9096001|243114000
a diagnosis.|439401001

Cognitive dysfunction|386806002
of shorter duration|260402009
is
called _delirium_.|419567006

In all types|261664005
of general cognitive dysfunction,|60132005|386806002
higher mental functions|75540009|285231000|371879000|285231000
are
affected|247591002|248448006
first|255216001|232714002
in the process.|415178003

Especially
in later stages|260383002|261612004
of the condition,|260905004
subjects
may
be
disoriented|62476001
in time|410669006
(
not
knowing|36692007
the day,|258703001|259032004
week,|258705008|259038000
or
even year|258707000|259039008
)
,
in place|257557008|421066005
(
not
knowing|36692007
where they
are
)
,
and
in person|125676002
(
not
knowing|36692007
who they,
or
others|74964007
around them,
are
).

Dementia,|12348006|52448006
though
often treatable|70232002
to some degree,|258395000|246173007
is
usually
due to causes|134198009
that
are
progressive|255314001
and
incurable,
as
observed
in primary progressive aphasia (PPA).[3][4][5]|63161005|230278002|261424001|230278002

Symptoms
of dementia|12348006|52448006
can
be
classified|73504009
as
either
reversible|35174006
or
irreversible,
depending
upon the etiology|134198009
of the disease.|64572001

Fewer|57176003
than 10%
of cases|398241000|413769002
of dementia|12348006|52448006
are
due to causes|134198009
that
may
presently
be
reversed
with treatment.|276239002|416118004

Causes|134198009
include|55919000
many different specific disease processes,|263735002|69658003|64572001|415178003
in the same way|262126009
that symptoms
of organ dysfunction|410653004|386585008
such as shortness|359530003|367450005
of breath,|11891009
jaundice,|18165001
or
pain|22253000
are
attributable
to many etiologies.|134198009

Delirium|419567006
can
be
easily|36203004
confused|286933003
with dementia|12348006|52448006
due to similar symptoms.

Delirium|419567006
is
characterized
by a sudden onset,|385315009|255363002
fluctuating|255341006
course,|288524001
a short duration|260402009
(often|70232002
lasting
from hours|258702006
to weeks|258705008
)
,
and
is
primarily
related|272151006|262094002
to a somatic|387133006
(
or
medical|74188005
)
disturbance.

In comparison,
dementia|12348006|52448006
has
typically
an insidious onset|367326009
(
except
in the cases|398241000|413769002
of a stroke|230690007
or
trauma
)
,
slow decline|419443000
of mental functioning,|285231000
as well as
a longer duration|260384008
(
from months|258706009
to years|258707000
).

Some mental illnesses,|74732009
including|55919000
depression|35489007|366979004|255339005
and
psychosis,|69322001|191525009
may
produce
symptoms
that
must
be
differentiated|263933003
from
both
delirium|419567006
and
dementia.[7]|12348006|52448006

There
are
many specific types|260396001|69658003|261664005
(causes|134198009
)
of dementia,|12348006|52448006
often|70232002
showing
slightly different symptoms.|425404009|263735002

However,
the symptom overlap|24846002
is
such
that
it
is
impossible to
diagnose|439401001
the type|261664005
of dementia|12348006|52448006
by symptomatology
alone,|105529008
and
in only|50607009|420295001
a few cases|57176003|398241000|57176003|413769002
are
symptoms enough to
give|419582001
a high probability|75540009|2931005|371879000|2931005
of some specific cause.|69658003|23981006|69658003|134198009

Diagnosis|439401001
is
therefore
aided|62479008|246088000
by nuclear medicine brain scanning techniques.|394649004|12738006|373205008|272394005|394649004|12738006|272394005|394649004|258335003|373205008|272394005|394649004|258335003|272394005|373205008|12738006|373205008|272394005|373205008|12738006|272394005|373205008|258335003|373205008|272394005|373205008|258335003|272394005|371572003|12738006|373205008|272394005|371572003|12738006|272394005|371572003|258335003|373205008|272394005|371572003|258335003|272394005

Certainty|17162000
cannot
be
attained
except
with brain biopsy|12738006|86273004|258335003|86273004
during life,|224130005
or
at autopsy|168461002
in death.|419620001|268923008

Some
of the most common forms|4757001|72906007|246176004
of dementia|12348006|52448006
are
:
Alzheimer's disease,|26929004
vascular dementia,|429998004
frontotemporal dementia,|13092008|230270009
semantic dementia|230288001
and
dementia|12348006|52448006
with Lewy bodies.|43127003

It
is
possible|371930009|60022001
for a patient to|116154003
exhibit
two|420797005
or
more dementing processes|242762006|415178003
at the same time,|262126009|410669006
as
none|260413007
of the known types|36692007|261664005
of dementia|12348006|52448006
protects
against the others.|74964007

Indeed,
about
ten|23067006|420258001
per cent|118582008
of people|125676002
with dementia|12348006|52448006
have
what
is
known|36692007
as
_mixed dementia_,|26242008|12348006|26242008|52448006
which
may
be
a combination|89780004
of Alzheimer's disease|26929004
and
multi-infarct dementia.[8][9]|56267009

Dementia|12348006|52448006
is
not merely
a problem|55607006
of memory.|303116000|106136008

It
reduces|260400001
the ability to|371150009
learn|69998004
,
reason,|410666004
retain|397909002
or
recall
past experience|410513005
and
there
is
also loss
of patterns|272135003
of thoughts,|88952004
feelings|285854004
and
activities|257733005
(Gelder _
et
al._ 2005
).

Additional mental|260364009
and
behavioral problems often|277843001|70232002|70232002
affect|4065008
people|125676002
who
have
dementia,|12348006|52448006
and
may
influence
quality|263496004
of life,|224130005
caregivers,|133932002
and
the need|410525008|103325001
for institutionalization.

As dementia worsens individuals|12348006|230993007|125676002|12348006|230993007|385435006|12348006|390772001|125676002|12348006|390772001|385435006|52448006|230993007|125676002|52448006|230993007|385435006|52448006|390772001|125676002|52448006|390772001|385435006
may
neglect|95930005
themselves
and
may
become
disinhibited
and
may
become
incontinent.|261088008

(Gelder _
et
al._ 2005
).

Depression|35489007|366979004|255339005
affects|4065008
20?30%
of people|125676002
who
have
dementia,|12348006|52448006
and
about 20%
have
anxiety.|48694002|197480006

Psychosis|69322001|191525009
(often delusions|70232002|2073000
of persecution
)
and
agitation/aggression also often accompany dementia.|162221009|61372001|70232002|12348006|162221009|61372001|70232002|52448006

Each
of these
must
be
assessed
and
treated|28995006
independently of the underlying dementia.[11]|12348006|52448006

Driving|129060000
with dementia|12348006|52448006
could
lead|88488004
to severe injury|24484000
or
even death|419620001|268923008
to self
and
others.|74964007

Doctors|309343006
should
advise|424900004
appropriate testing|272393004
on
when
to
quit
driving.[12]|129060000

In the United States,|223688001
Florida's Baker|224048003|308241004
Act
allows
law-enforcement authorities
and
the judiciary to
force|285653008
mental evaluation|386053000
for those
suspected|415684004
of suffering
from dementia|12348006|52448006
or
other mental incapacities._[citation|74964007

In the United Kingdom,|223860005
as
with all mental disorders,|74732009
where
a person|125676002
with dementia|12348006|52448006
could
potentially
be
a danger
to themselves
or
others,|74964007
they
can
be
detained
under the Mental Health Act 1983|263775005
for the purposes|363675004
of assessment,|386053000
care
and
treatment.|276239002|416118004

This
is
a last resort,
and
usually
avoided
if
the patient|116154003
has
family|35359004
or
friends|113163005
who
can
ensure
care.

The United Kingdom DVLA|223860005
(Driving & Vehicle Licensing Agency|129060000|412307009|224877003|129060000|261324000|224877003
)
states|398070004
that people|125676002
with dementia|12348006|52448006
who specifically
suffer
with poor short term memory,|247592009
disorientation,|286933003|62476001
lack|41277001
of insight|27026000
or
judgment|61254005
are
almost certainly
not
fit|91175000|102499006
to
drive?|247750002
and
in these instances,
the DVLA
must
be
informed|410938009|223458004
so said license|223528007|66049007
can
be
revoked.

They
do
however
acknowledge
low-severity cases|62482003|272141005|398241000|62482003|272141005|413769002|371880002|272141005|398241000|371880002|272141005|413769002
and
those
with an early diagnosis,|264499004|439401001|264499004
and
those drivers|236320001
may
be
permitted|958006
to
drive|247750002
pending medical reports.

Behaviour|844005
may
be
disorganized
,
restless|162221009
or
inappropriate.

Some people|125676002
become
restless|162221009
or
wander about|50239007
by day|258703001|259032004
and
sometimes
at night.|2546009

When
people|125676002
suffering
from dementia|12348006|52448006
are
put
in circumstances
beyond their abilities,|371150009
there
may
be
a sudden change|255363002|243326001|255363002|263703002
to tears|40431001|122594008

Less commonly,|276139006|263796003
a non-degenerative condition|33359002|260905004

Causes|134198009
of dementia|12348006|52448006
depend
on the age|424144002
at which symptoms
begin.|255395001

In the elderly population|105436006|385436007|105436006|389109008
(usually
defined
in this context|263491009
as
over 65 years|21481007|264695004|258707000
of age|424144002
)
,
a large majority|255509001
of cases|398241000|413769002
of dementia|12348006|52448006
are
caused|23981006|134198009
by Alzheimer's disease,|26929004
vascular dementia,|429998004
or
both.

Dementia|12348006|52448006
with Lewy bodies|43127003
is
another common cause,|72906007|134198009
which again
may
occur|272120004
alongside either
or
both
of the other causes.|74964007|134198009

Hypothyroidism sometimes|40930008
causes|134198009
slowly progressive cognitive impairment|419443000|255314001|386806002
as the main symptom,|63161005
and
this
may
be
fully reversible|35174006
with treatment.|276239002|416118004

Normal pressure hydrocephalus,|30753002
though
relatively rare,|84638005|103356009
is
important to
recognize
since
treatment|276239002|416118004
may
prevent
progression|246453008|246450006
and
improve|385425000|3442003|385633008
other symptoms|74964007
of the condition.|260905004

However,
significant cognitive improvement|386134007
is
unusual.

Dementia|12348006|52448006
is
much less common|242762006|72906007|4757001|72906007
under 65 years|264695004|258707000
of age.|424144002

Alzheimer's disease|26929004
is
still
the most frequent cause,|4757001|70232002|134198009
but
inherited forms|255404009|246176004
of the disease account|64572001
for a higher proportion|75540009|8212001|371879000|8212001
of cases|398241000|413769002
in this age group.|424144002|261586004|424144002|160481000|424144002|389109008

Frontotemporal lobar degeneration|230273006
and
Huntington's disease account|58756001
for most
of the remaining cases.|398241000|413769002

Vascular dementia also|429998004
occurs|272120004
,
but
this in turn|282987006
may
be
due to underlying conditions|260905004
(
including|55919000
antiphospholipid syndrome,|26843008
CADASIL,|390936003
MELAS,|39925003

Binswanger's disease.|90099008

People|125676002
who
receive
frequent head trauma,|70232002|82271004
such as boxers|42250008
or
football players,|413489002|413494002|88289009|26239002

at risk|410519009
of chronic traumatic encephalopathy[21]|78689005|263904004|90734009|230282000|90734009|127295002
(also called dementia pugilistica|230283005
in boxers|42250008

In young adults|84422007|133936004
(
up to 40 years|259031006|258707000
of age|424144002

who
were
previously
of normal intelligence,|26941006
it
is
very rare to|260358002|84638005|260358002|103356009
develop
dementia|12348006|52448006
without other features|74964007
of neurological disease,|118940003
or
without features
of disease elsewhere|64572001
in the body.|279495008|123037004

Most cases|398241000|413769002
of progressive cognitive disturbance|255314001|386806002
in this age group|424144002|261586004|424144002|160481000|424144002|389109008

caused|23981006|134198009
by psychiatric illness,|74732009
alcohol|419442005|53041004|430837008
or
other drugs,|74964007|410942007
or
metabolic disturbance.

However,
certain genetic disorders|17162000|32895009
can
cause|23981006|134198009
true neurodegenerative dementia|31874001|12348006|31874001|52448006
at this age.|424144002

These
include|55919000
familial Alzheimer's disease,
SCA17
(dominant inheritance|246071007
)
;
adrenoleukodystrophy|65389002
(X-linked|263934009

pantothenate kinase-associated neurodegeneration,|87344008|47429007
Tay-Sachs disease|111385000
and
Wilson's disease|190823004
(
all recessive
).

Wilson's disease|190823004
is
particularly important
since
cognition
can
improve|385425000|3442003|385633008
with treatment.|276239002|416118004

At all ages,|424144002
a substantial proportion|8212001
of patients|116154003
who complain
of memory difficulty|303116000|371157007|106136008|371157007
or
other cognitive symptoms|74964007
are
suffering
from depression|35489007|366979004|255339005
rather than
a neurodegenerative disease.|64572001

Vitamin deficiencies|85670002
and
chronic infections|177010002
may
also
occur|272120004
at any age|424144002
;
they usually
cause|23981006|134198009
other symptoms|74964007
before dementia|12348006|52448006
occurs|272120004

occasionally
mimic
degenerative dementia.|33359002|12348006|33359002|52448006

deficiencies|260372006|248325000
of vitamin B12,|419382002
folate

subacute sclerosing panencephalitis,|416154000
syphilis|76272004
and
Whipple's disease.|41545003

Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease typically|792004
causes|134198009
a dementia|12348006|52448006
that worsens|230993007|390772001
over weeks|258705008
to months,|258706009
being
caused|23981006|134198009
by prions.|84676004

The common causes|72906007|134198009
of slowly progressive dementia also sometimes|419443000|255314001|12348006|419443000|255314001|52448006

include|55919000
brain infection|12738006|258335003
(viral encephalitis,|34476008
subacute sclerosing panencephalitis,|416154000

late|260383002
in the illness,|39104002
or
as a minor feature.|410599005|255606000

For example,
a proportion|8212001
of patients|116154003
with Parkinson's disease|49049000
develop
dementia,|12348006|52448006

When
dementia|12348006|52448006
occurs|272120004
in Parkinson's disease,|49049000
the underlying cause|134198009

other setting to|74964007
screen|20135006|360156006
cognitive status.|263490005

Examples
of such tests|269814003|272393004
include|55919000
the abbreviated mental test score (AMTS),|446840000
the mini mental state examination (MMSE),|273617000
_Modified Mini-Mental State Examination_|273619002

,
[26]
the _Cognitive Abilities Screening Instrument_ (CASI),|413384008|20135006|57134006
[27]
the Trail-making test,|273882000
[28]
and
the clock drawing test.|269814003|272393004

Scores|278061009
must
be
interpreted|363714003
in the context|263491009
of the person's|125676002
educational|266981003|409073007
and
other background,|74964007
and
the particular circumstances.

For example,
a person highly|125676002|75540009
depressed|366979004
or
in great pain|255509001|22253000|263768009|22253000
is
not
expected
to do well|20572008
on many tests|269814003|272393004
of mental ability.|371150009

While
many tests|269814003|272393004
have
been
studied|110465008|224699009
,
[30][31][32]|264664006
and
some
may
emerge
as better alternatives|3442003
to the MMSE,
presently
the MMSE
is
the best|20572008|3442003
studied|110465008|224699009
and
most commonly|4757001
used.|394850002

Another approach
to screening|20135006
for dementia|12348006|52448006
is
to
ask
an informant
(relative|125677006|29920004
or
other supporter|74964007
)
to fill out
a questionnaire
about the person's everyday cognitive functioning.|125676002|69620002|413384008|125676002|69620002|311465003

Informant questionnaires
provide
complementary information
to brief cognitive tests.|359530003|269814003|359530003|272393004|359535008|269814003|359535008|272393004

Probably
the best known questionnaire|20572008|36692007|3442003|36692007
of this sort
is
the _Informant Questionnaire on Cognitive Decline in the Elderly (IQCODE)_.|386806002|105436006

On the other hand|74964007|85562004|74964007|302539009
the _General Practitioner Assessment|310813001
Of Cognition_
combines|20909006
both
,
a patient assessment|116154003|386053000

of other tests|74964007|269814003|74964007|272393004
of mental function.|285231000

Increasingly,
clinical neuropsychologists|58147004
provide
diagnostic consultation|439401001|11429006|261004008|11429006
following|255260001
administration|413454004|416118004
of a complex full battery|103360007|261015003|65053001|103360007|261015003|50084004
of cognitive testing,|272393004
often|70232002
lasting
several hours,|261028005|258702006
to
determine
functional patterns|40143009|272135003|246464006|272135003
of decline
associated|47429007
with varying types|261664005
of dementia.|12348006|52448006

Tests|269814003|272393004
of memory,|303116000|106136008
executive function,|246464006
processing|415178003
speed,
attention,|6769007
and
language skills|61909002
are
relevant,
as well as
tests|269814003|272393004
of emotional|285854004|408453002
and
psychological adjustment.|60224009|410616005|60224009|410617001

These tests|269814003|272393004
assist|116697009|119265000
with ruling out other etiologies|10828004|134198009
and
determining relative cognitive decline|125677006|386806002|29920004|386806002
over time|410669006
or
from estimates|414135002
of prior cognitive abilities.|236874000|413384008

Routine blood tests|50811001|252275004
are
also usually
performed|398166005
to
rule|10828004
out treatable causes.|255529000|134198009

These tests|269814003|272393004
include|55919000
vitamin B12,|419382002
folic acid,|63718003|104660009
thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH),|326013007
C-reactive protein,|61425002|55235003
full blood count,|26604007
electrolytes,|86355000
calcium,|5540006
renal function,|11953005
and
liver enzymes.|259670004|365769003

Abnormalities|276654001
may
suggest
vitamin deficiency,|85670002
infection
or
other problems|74964007|55607006
that commonly
cause|23981006|134198009
confusion|286933003
or
disorientation|286933003|62476001
in the elderly.|105436006

The problem|55607006
is
complicated|255302009
by the fact
that
these cause confusion more often|134198009|286933003|70232002
in persons|125676002
who
have
early dementia,|264499004|12348006|264499004|52448006
so
that "reversal"
of such problems|55607006
may
ultimately only
be
temporary._[citation|14803004

can
yield
information
relevant
to other types|74964007|261664005
of dementia,|12348006|52448006

would
point
at a vascular type|59820001|261664005

The functional neuroimaging modalities|40143009|246464006
of SPECT|105371005
and
PET
are
more useful|242762006
in assessing long-standing cognitive dysfunction,|255511005|10904000|386806002
since
they
have
shown
similar ability to|371150009
diagnose|439401001
dementia|12348006|52448006
as a clinical exam.|58147004|225886003

The ability|371150009
of SPECT to|105371005
differentiate|263933003
the vascular cause|59820001|134198009
from the Alzheimer's disease cause|134198009
of dementias,|52448006
appears
superior|261183002
to differentiation
by clinical exam.[35]|58147004|225886003

Recent research|6493001
has
established|263748003|385645004
the value
of PET
imaging|363679005|278395004
using|260676000
carbon-11 Pittsburgh Compound B|18989009
as a radiotracer
(PIB-PET

in predictive diagnosis|439401001
of various kinds|256220008|261664005
of dementia,|12348006|52448006
in particular Alzheimer's disease.|26929004

Studies|110465008|224699009
from Australia|223621005
have
found PIB-PET 86% accurate|404684003|263656005|263656005
in predicting
which patients|116154003

A study|110465008|224699009
done
at the University of Bari|224871002
in Italy,|223668000
found|404684003
that
a group|261586004|160481000|389109008
drinking|160573003|30953006
alcoholic beverages moderately|53527002

the study|110465008|224699009
found|404684003
that
that
over the duration|103335007
of 3.5 years|260280001|258707000
the people|125676002
with MCI|282110000|386805003
who
drank|160573003|25702006|86933000|226465004|30953006
less
than one alcoholic beverage|421379005|53527002
a day|258703001|259032004
progressed|385651009
to dementia|12348006|52448006
at a rate
that
was
85% slower|419443000

However,
the authors|308004006
of the study|110465008|224699009
commented
that
since
it
was
epidemiologic,
the findings|404684003

The study,|110465008|224699009
published
in the _Lancet Neurology_ journal July 2008,|350810002|394591006|433497004

are
often|70232002
used early|394850002|264499004

be
appropriate.

Educating|409073007
and

It
is
important to
recognize
that
since
dementia|12348006|52448006
impairs|260379002|40226000
normal communication|17621005|263536004|258744000|263536004
due to changes|243326001|263703002

solve
,
agitated behaviour|162221009
is
often|70232002
a form|246176004
of communication|263536004
for the person|125676002
with dementia|12348006|52448006
and
actively
searching
for a potential cause,|30207005|134198009
such as pain,|22253000
physical illness,|5880005|39104002|19388002|39104002
or
overstimulation
can
be
helpful
in reducing agitation.|260400001|162221009

[45] Additionally,
using|260676000
an ?ABC analysis|272389005
of behaviour?|844005
can
be
a useful tool|86967005
for understanding behavior|66216009|844005
in patients|116154003
with dementia.|12348006|52448006

It
involves|248448006
looking|386548000
at the antecedants (A),
behavior (B),|844005
and
consequences (C)|103332005
associated|47429007
with an event to|272379006
help
define
the problem|55607006
and
prevent
further incidents|46053002
that
may
arise|68727004
if
the person?s needs|125676002|410525008|125676002|103325001
are
misunderstood.

Although
persistent pain|22253000
in the person|125676002
with dementia|12348006|52448006
is
difficult|52925006
to communicate,|288577006

and
treat|395077000
,
failure to|76797004
address|397635003
persistent pain|22253000
has
profound functional, psychosocial|40143009|246464006
and
quality|263496004
of life implications|224130005
for this vulnerable population.|385436007|389109008

Health professionals often|70232002|223366009|70232002
lack|41277001
the skills
and
usually
lack|41277001

Family members|303071001
and
friends|113163005
can
make
a valuable contribution
to the care
of a person|125676002
with dementia|12348006|52448006
by learning to|69998004
recognize
and
assess
their pain.|22253000

Educational resources|266981003|409073007

special care units|274409007
in nursing homes often|42665001|70232002
provide
specialized care|67995009
for dementia patients.|12348006|116154003|52448006|116154003

Adult daycare centers|370878002|413456002

providing respite
for caregivers.|133932002

In addition,|260364009

for more individualized attention|242762006|6769007
that
is
needed|410525008|103325001
as the disease progresses.|64572001|385651009

While

have
found|404684003

Psychiatric nurses|310186002|224563006

Psychiatric nursing|27296002|169741004|27296002|265937000|27296002
is
based|418836005
on four main premises|421534005|63161005
:

The risks|30207005
associated|47429007
with the use|277889008|419385000
of tubes|83059008|418530008
are
not well known.|20572008|36692007

However,
the risks|30207005
include|55919000
agitation|162221009
and
the patient pulling out|116154003|303370007
the feeding tube,|25062003
tubes|83059008|418530008
becoming
dislodged, clogged,
or
malpositioned.|408737001

There
is
about a 1% fatality rate directly|399166001
related|272151006|262094002
to the procedure [71]|71388002|264699005
with a 3% major complication rate [72]|260313008|255603008|116223007|260313008|255603008|263718001

Evidence|18669006
from well-planned, representative epidemiological surveys|20572008|397943006
is
scarce
in many regions,|410673009
particularly
in low-income countries.|223369002|424860001|223369002

However,
a 2009 study|110465008|224699009
by Alzheimer Disease|26929004
International
estimated|414135002
the global prevalence|60132005
of dementia|12348006|52448006
will
almost
double|1305003
every 20 years,|258707000
from 35.6 million
in 2010,
to 65.7 million|264695004
by 2030
and
115.4 million
by 2050.

Around two thirds|420797005|70905002
of individuals|125676002|385435006
with dementia|12348006|52448006
live|419749002
in low|62482003|371880002
and
middle income countries,|255562008|223369002|399488007|223369002
where
the sharpest increases|410707003|260366006
in numbers|410680006|410681005
are
predicted.

A recent survey|6493001
done
by Harvard University School|224871002|257698009
of Public Health|310115006
and
the Alzheimer's Europe consortium|223502009
revealed|263857004
that
the second leading health concern|81170007|236874000|263775005|257997001|236874000|263775005|288495006|236874000|263775005
(
after cancer|363346000|372087000
)
among adults|133936004
is
Dementia.[75]|12348006|52448006

Until the end|261782000|422117008
of the 19th century,
dementia|12348006|52448006
was
a much broader clinical concept.|242762006|90522003|58147004|4757001|90522003|58147004

It
included mental illness|55919000|74732009
and
any type|261664005
of psychosocial incapacity,
including|55919000
conditions|78326006|260905004
that
could
be
reversed.

Dementia|12348006|52448006
at this time simply|410669006
referred|439980006
to anyone
who
had
lost
the ability to|371150009
reason|410666004
,
and
was
applied|410618006
equally
to psychosis|69322001|191525009
of mental illness,|74732009
"organic" diseases|64572001
like syphilis|76272004
that destroy
the brain,|12738006|258335003
and
to the dementia|12348006|52448006
associated|47429007
with old age,|105436006|32864002
which
was
attributed|246061005
to "hardening|19730000
of the arteries."|51114001|11527006

Dementia|12348006|52448006
in the elderly|105436006
was
called
_senile dementia_|26929004|191449005
or
_senility,|32864002
_
and
viewed|246516004
as a normal|17621005|258744000
and
somewhat inevitable aspect
of growing old,|70753007
rather than
as
being
caused|23981006|134198009
by any specific diseases.|69658003|64572001

At the same time,|262126009|410669006
in 1907,
a specific organic dementing process|69658003|415178003
of early onset, called Alzheimer's disease,|416780008
had
been
described.

This
was
associated|47429007
with particular microscopic changes|84496004|243326001|84496004|263703002
in the brain,|12738006|258335003
but
was
seen
as a rare disease|84638005|64572001|103356009|64572001
of middle age.|28288005

Much
like other diseases|74964007|64572001
associated|47429007
with aging,|248280005
dementia|12348006|52448006
was
rare|84638005|103356009
before the 20th century,
although
by no means|255586005
unknown|261665006
,
due to the fact
that
it
is
most prevalent|4757001
in people|125676002
over 80,
and
such lifespans
were
uncommon|103356009
in preindustrial times.|410669006|417929005

Conversely,
syphilitic dementia|263891000|12348006|263891000|52448006
was
widespread|85333001
in the developed world
until
largely
being
eradicated
by the use|277889008|419385000
of penicillin|373270004
after WWII.

By the period|259037005
of 1913-20,
schizophrenia|58214004
had
been
well-defined|260409000
in a way
similar
to today,
and
also
the term dementia praecox|58214004
had
been
used|394850002
to
suggest
the development|278923009
of senile-type dementia|26929004|261664005|191449005|261664005
at a younger age.|84422007|424144002

Eventually
the two terms|420797005
fused
,
so
that
until 1952 physicians|309343006
used|394850002
the terms _dementia praecox_|58214004
(precocious dementia|235246008|12348006|235246008|52448006
)
and
_schizophrenia_ interchangeably.|58214004

The term _precocious dementia_|235246008|12348006|235246008|52448006
for a mental illness|74732009
suggested
that
a type|261664005
of mental illness|74732009
like schizophrenia|58214004
(
including|55919000
paranoia|191667009
and
decreased cognitive capacity|1250004|260400001|260371004
)
could
be
expected
to
arrive
normally
in all persons|125676002
with greater age|263768009|424144002
(
see|281004000
paraphrenia.|26472000

After
about 1920,
the beginning use|255395001|277889008|255395001|419385000
of _dementia_|12348006|52448006
for what
we now
understand|66216009
as schizophrenia|58214004
and
senile dementia|26929004|191449005
helped
limit|255469002
the word's|255373000
meaning|255586005
to "permanent, irreversible mental deterioration."|6934004
This
began|255395001
the change|243326001|263703002
to the more recognizable use|242762006|277889008|242762006|419385000
of the term today.

In 1976,
neurologist Robert Katzmann|56397003
suggested
a link
between senile dementia|26929004|191449005
and
Alzheimer's disease.|26929004

Katzmann
suggested
that much|242762006|4757001
of the senile dementia|26929004|191449005
occurring|272120004
(
by definition
)
after the age|424144002
of 65,|264695004
was
pathologically identical|20323000
with Alzheimer's disease|26929004
occurring|272120004
before age 65|424144002|264695004
and
therefore
should
not
be
treated|28995006
differently.

He
noted
that
the fact
that "senile dementia"|26929004|191449005
was
not
considered
a disease,|64572001
but
rather part|260726005
of aging,|248280005
was
keeping millions
of aged patients|424144002|116154003|105436006|116154003
experiencing
what otherwise
was
identical|20323000
with Alzheimer's disease|26929004
from
being
diagnosed|439401001
as
having
a disease process,|64572001|415178003
rather than
simply
considered
as aging normally.|248280005

Katzmann thus
suggested
that Alzheimer's disease,|26929004
if
taken|419652001
to
occur|272120004
over age 65,|424144002|264695004
is
actually common,|72906007
not rare,|84638005|103356009
and
was
the 4th|29970001
or
5th leading cause|32088001|236874000|134198009
of death,|419620001|268923008
even
though
rarely|103356009
reported|229059009|223458004
on death certificates|307930005
in 1976.

This suggestion
opened|56116003
the view|246516004
that dementia|12348006|52448006
is
never normal,|17621005|258744000
and
must
always
be
the result|394617004
of a particular disease process,|64572001|415178003
and
is
not part|260726005
of the normal healthy aging process,|17621005|263775005|248280005|415178003|258744000|263775005|248280005|415178003
_per se_.

The ensuing debate
led|88488004|236874000
for a time|410669006
to the proposed disease diagnosis|64572001|439401001|64572001
of "senile dementia of the Alzheimer's type" (SDAT)|18720000|26929004|261664005|18720000|191449005|261664005
in persons|125676002
over the age|424144002
of 65,|264695004
with "Alzheimer's disease"|26929004
diagnosed|439401001
in persons|125676002
younger|84422007
than 65|264695004
who
had
the same pathology.|262126009|394595002

Eventually,
however,
it
was
agreed
that
the age limit|424144002|255469002
was
artificial,|71967004
and
that Alzheimer's disease|26929004
was
the appropriate term
for persons|125676002
with the particular brain pathology|12738006|394595002|258335003|394595002
seen
in this disease,|64572001
regardless of the age|424144002
of the person|125676002
with the diagnosis.|439401001

A helpful finding|404684003
was
that
although
the incidence
of Alzheimer's disease|26929004
increased|35105006|260366006
with age|424144002
(
from 5-10%|264706000|264605009
of 75-year-olds|258707000|70753007|259039008|70753007
to
as
many
as 40-50%|259031006
of 90-year-olds|264705001|258707000|70753007|264705001|259039008|70753007|264703008|258707000|70753007|264703008|259039008|70753007
)
,
there
was
no age|424144002
at which
all persons|125676002
developed
it,
so
it
was
not
an inevitable consequence|103332005
of aging,|248280005
no matter
how
great|255509001|263768009
an age|424144002
a person|125676002
attained.

Evidence|18669006
of this
is
shown
by numerous documented supercentenarians|260396001|397934002
(people|125676002
living|224130005|419749002
to 110+
)
that
experienced
no serious cognitive impairment.|42745003|386806002

Also,
after
1952,
mental illnesses|74732009
like schizophrenia|58214004
were
removed|127485006
from the category
of _organic brain syndromes,
_
and
thus
(
by definition
)
removed|127485006
from possible causes|371930009|134198009|60022001|134198009
of "dementing illnesses"|39104002
(dementias|52448006
).

At the same, however,|262126009
the traditional cause|263901007|134198009
of senile dementia?|26929004|191449005
"hardening|19730000
of the arteries" ? now|51114001|11527006
returned|7528007
as a set
of dementias|52448006
of vascular cause|59820001|134198009
(small strokes|255507004|230690007
).

These
were
now
termed
_multi-infarct dementias_|56267009
or
_vascular dementias_.|429998004

In the 21st century,
a number|410680006|410681005
of other types|74964007|261664005
of dementia|12348006|52448006
have
been
differentiated|263933003
from Alzheimer's disease|26929004
and
vascular dementias|429998004
(
these two|420797005
being
the most common types|4757001|72906007|261664005
).

This differentiation
is
on the basis|418836005
of pathological examination|394595002|5880005|29458008|5880005
of brain tissues,|256865009
symptomatology,
and
by different patterns|263735002|272135003
of brain metabolic activity|263689005
in nuclear medical imaging tests|84640000|278395004|269814003|84640000|278395004|272393004
such as SPECT|105371005
and
PETscans
of the brain.|12738006|258335003

The various forms|256220008|246176004
of dementia|12348006|52448006
have
differing prognoses|20481000
(expected outcome|394617004
of illness|39104002
)
,
and
also differing sets
of epidemologic risk factors.|80943009

The causal etiology|134198009|134198009
of many|260396001
of them,
including|55919000
