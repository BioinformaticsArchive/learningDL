*Amputation|81723002
*
*
is
the removal|118292001|128303001
of a body extremity|279495008|66019005|123037004|66019005
by trauma,
prolonged constriction,|255224006|27551008
or
surgery.|83578000

As a surgical measure,|83578000|246445000|83578000|272391002
it
is
used to|394850002
control|31509003
pain|22253000
or
a disease process|64572001|415178003
in the affected limb,|247591002|66019005|247591002|243996003|248448006|66019005|248448006|243996003
such as malignancy|363346000|372087000
or
gangrene.|372070002

In some cases,|398241000|413769002
it
is
carried out|288345009
on individuals|125676002|385435006
as a preventative surgery|83578000
for such problems.|55607006

A special case|67995009|398241000
is
that
of congenital amputation,|6160004|81723002|255399007|81723002
a congenital disorder,|66091009
where fetal limbs|66019005
have
been
cut off|283396008
by constrictive bands.|27551008|77541009

In some countries,|223369002
amputation|81723002
of the hands,|85562004
feet|56459004|259051005
or
other body parts|74964007|38866009
is
or
was
used|394850002
as a form|246176004
of punishment
for people|125676002
who
committed
crimes.

Amputation|81723002
has
also
been
used|394850002
as a tactic
in war
and
acts
of terrorism|257877007
;
it
may
also
occur|272120004
as a war injury.|274230000

In some
cultures|252398009|61594008
and
religions,
minor amputations|410599005|81723002|255606000|81723002
or
mutilations
are
considered
a ritual accomplishment.|67431008|262108006

Unlike some non-mammalian animals|387976007|387961004
(
such as lizards|2773008
that
shed
their tails,|13951002
salamanders|23873006
that
can
regrow
many missing body parts,|371640009
and
hydras,|421071003
flatworms,|106685002
and
starfish|421828008
that
can
regrow entire bodies|255503000|279495008|255503000|123037004|260232004|279495008|260232004|123037004
from small fragments|255507004|29140007
)
,
once
removed|127485006
,
human extremities|278412004|66019005|278412004|2592007
do
not
grow
back,
unlike portions|260726005
of some organs,|410653004
such as the liver.|10200004|181268008

A transplant|263903005|24486003
or
a prosthesis|53350007|118663006
are
the only options|50607009|420295001
for recovering|74822006
the loss.

In the
US,
the majority
of new amputations|7147002|81723002
occur|272120004
due to complications|116223007
of the vascular system|59820001|246333005
(
the blood vessels|59820001
)
,
especially
from diabetes.|73211009

Between 1988
and
1996,
there
were
an average
of 133,735 hospital|285201006
discharges|307488001
for amputation|81723002
per year|258707000|259039008
in the
US.[1]|260305007

Types|261664005
of amputation|81723002
include|55919000
:

Hemicorporectomy,
or
amputation|81723002
at the waist,|33673004|243989000
and
decapitation,|110014005
or
amputation|81723002
at the neck,|45048000|302550007
are
the most radical amputations.|4757001|78699000

Genital modification|263767004|243326001
and
mutilation
may
involve|248448006
amputating
tissue,|85756007
although
not necessarily
as a result|394617004
of injury
or
disease.|64572001

As a rule,|10828004
partial amputations|255609007|81723002
are
preferred|225773000
to
preserve|277405005
joint function,|189834007
but
in oncological surgery,|3428006|83578000
disarticulation|15440009
is
favored._[citation

In some rare cases|84638005|398241000|84638005|413769002|103356009|398241000|103356009|413769002
when
a person|125676002
has
become
trapped|403833009
in a deserted place,|284565008|257557008|284565008|421066005
with no means|255586005
of communication|263536004
or
hope|247798006
of rescue,
the victim
has
amputated
his
or
her own limb|66019005|243996003
:

Even rarer|84638005|103356009
are
cases|398241000|413769002
where self-amputation|81723002
is
performed|398166005
for criminal
or
political purposes|363675004
:

Body integrity identity disorder|279495008|11163003|66936004|279495008|246224005|66936004|123037004|11163003|66936004|123037004|246224005|66936004
is
a psychological condition|60224009|260905004
in which
an individual feels|125676002|285854004|385435006|285854004
compelled
to
remove|127485006
one|421379005
or
more
of their body parts,|38866009
usually
a limb.|66019005|243996003

In some cases,|398241000|413769002
that individual|125676002|385435006
may
take|419652001
drastic measures to|246445000|367346004
remove|127485006
the offending appendages,|66754008|181255000
either
by causing irreparable damage|23981006|37782003
to the limb|66019005|243996003
so
that medical intervention|74188005|225334002
cannot
save the limb,|66019005|243996003
or
by causing|23981006
the limb to|66019005|243996003
be
severed.

The first step|255216001|398298007|232714002|398298007
is
ligating
the supplying artery|425398004|51114001|425398004|11527006
and
vein,|29092000|181367001
to
prevent
hemorrhage|131148009
(bleeding|131148009
).

The muscles|91727004
are
transected
,
and
finally
the bone|272673000|3138006|90780006|128530007
is
sawed
through
with an oscillating saw.

Sharp|410707003
and
rough edges|57183005
of the bone|272673000|3138006|90780006|128530007
(s)
are
filed|12953007
down,
skin|119325001|39937001|181469002
and
muscle flaps|3911000
are
then
transposed
over the stump,|38033009
occasionally
with the insertion|71861002|257867005
of elements to|57795002
attach|102491009
a prosthesis.|53350007|118663006

Amputations|81723002
are
traumatic experiences|263904004
that
reduce|260400001
the quality|263496004
of life|224130005
for patients|116154003
in addition|260364009
to
being
expensive.

A typical prosthetic limb|66019005|243996003
costs
in the range
of $10,000?15,000
according to the American Diabetic Association.|263534001|272151006

Preventing amputations|81723002|116699007|81723002
is
a critical task.

Methods|260686004|272394005
in preventing amputation|81723002|116699007|81723002
depend
on the problems|55607006
that
might
cause|23981006|134198009
amputations to|81723002
be
necessary.

Chronic infections,|177010002
often|70232002
caused|23981006|134198009
by diabetes|73211009
or
decubitus ulcers|420226006
in bedridden patients,|160685001
are
common causes|72906007|134198009
of infections
that
lead|88488004
to gangrene,|372070002
which
would
then
necessitate
amputation.|81723002

There
are
two key challenges|420797005
:
first,|255216001|232714002
many patients|116154003
have
impaired circulation|260379002|413854007|40226000|413854007
in their extremities,|66019005|2592007
and
second,|81170007|257997001|288495006
they
have
difficulty curing infections|371157007
in limbs|66019005
with poor vasculation|11403006|255351007
(blood circulation|87612001|413854007|119273009|413854007
).

Crush injuries|125665001
where there
is
extensive tissue damage|41118005|37782003
and
poor circulation also
benefit
from hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT).|18678000

The high level|75540009|258395000|75540009|276625007|371879000|258395000|371879000|276625007
of oxygenation|44284008
and
revascularization speed up recovery times|297183000|255532002|410669006|297183000|255532002|417929005|297183000|353734004|410669006|297183000|353734004|417929005
and
prevent
infections.

A study|110465008|224699009
found|404684003
that
the patented method|56116003|260686004|56116003|272394005
called
Circulator Boot|413854007|16056004
achieved
significant results|386134007|394617004
in prevention|169443000
of amputation|81723002
in patients|116154003
with diabetes|73211009
and
arterioscleorosis.

Another study|110465008|224699009
found|404684003
it also effective|255403003|254648000
for healing limb ulcers|25845007|66019005|25845007|243996003|125313005|66019005|125313005|243996003
caused|23981006|134198009
by peripheral vascular disease.|400047006

The boot|16056004
checks|360160009
the heart rhythm|251149006
and
compresses|37204000
the limb|66019005|243996003
between heartbeats|248646004
;
the compression|71173004|263720003
helps
cure
the wounds|13924000
in the walls|224727009
of veins|29092000
and
arteries,|51114001|11527006
and
helps
to
push|420620005
the blood|87612001|119273009
back
to the heart.[17]|80891009|302509004

For victims
of trauma,
advances|86005002
in microsurgery|10724008
in the 1970s
have
made replantations|3137001
of severed body parts|38866009
possible.|371930009|60022001

The individual|125676002|385435006
may
experience
psychological trauma|60224009|60224009
and
emotional discomfort.|285854004|367391008|285854004|87128005|408453002|367391008|408453002|87128005

The stump|38033009
will
remain
an area|42798000
of reduced mechanical stability.|260400001|261018001|58158008

Limb loss|41944006
can
present|52101004|246105001
significant|386134007
or
even drastic practical limitations.|246175000

A large proportion|255509001|8212001
of amputees|41944006
(50?80%
)
experience
the phenomenon
of phantom limbs|59603003
;[18]
they
feel|285854004
body parts|38866009
that
are
no longer there.|255511005

These limbs|66019005
can
itch,|424492005
ache,|410711009
burn,|125666000
feel|285854004
tense,|263897001
dry|13880007
or
wet,|17461003
locked
in
or
trapped|403833009
or
they
can
feel|285854004
as if
they
are
moving.

Some scientists|308027003
believe
it
has
to do
with a kind|261664005
of neural|3057000|256864008
map|360220002
that
the brain|12738006|258335003
has
of the body,|279495008|123037004
which
sends
information
to the rest|258157001
of the brain|12738006|258335003
about limbs|66019005
regardless of their existence.

Phantom sensations|106148006|272144002
and
phantom pain|59603003
may
also
occur|272120004
after the removal|118292001|128303001
of body parts|38866009
other than the limbs,|66019005
e.g.|258795003

after amputation|81723002
of the breast,|76752008|181131000
extraction|62972009
of a tooth|38199008|302214001
(phantom tooth pain|59603003|38199008|59603003|302214001|27355003
)
or
removal|118292001|128303001
of an eye|81745001|244486005
(phantom eye syndrome.|81745001|244486005

A similar phenomenon
is
unexplained
sensation|106148006|271712005|272144002
in a body part|38866009
unrelated|262241003
to the amputated limb.|66019005|243996003

It
has
been
hypothesized
that
the portion|260726005
of the brain|12738006|258335003
responsible|394851003
for processing stimulation|415178003|122545008
from amputated limbs,|66019005
being
deprived
of input,
expands|70955005
into the surrounding brain,|355648006|12738006|355648006|258335003
(Phantoms
in the Brain|12738006|258335003
:
V.

S.

Ramachandran
and
Sandra Blakeslee
)
such
that
an individual|125676002|385435006
who
has
had
an arm|40983000|53120007|182245002|302538001
amputated
will
experience
unexplained pressure|279046003|13543005|257893003
or
movement|255324009
on his face|89545001|302549007
or
head_[citation|69536005|302548004
needed|410525008|103325001
_].

In many cases,|398241000|413769002
the phantom limb|59603003
aids|62479008
in adaptation|60783002|4452006
to a prosthesis,|53350007|118663006
as
it
permits|958006
the person to|125676002
experience
proprioception
of the prosthetic limb.|66019005|243996003

To
support|9096001|243114000
improved resistance|385425000|30714006|3442003|30714006
or
usability,|277889008|419385000
comfort
or
healing,|298005009|90910008
some type|261664005
of stump socks|38033009|262156000
may
be
worn
instead of
or
as part|260726005
of wearing
a prosthesis.|53350007|118663006

Another side effect
can
be
heterotopic ossification,|128491006
especially
when
a bone injury|284003005
is
combined|89780004
with a head injury.|82271004

The brain|12738006|258335003
signals|38952000
the bone to|272673000|3138006|90780006|128530007
grow
instead of scar tissue to|70582006|275322007
form|246176004
,
and
nodules|27925004|279365004
and
other growth|74964007
can
interfere|78235001
with prosthetics
and
sometimes
require
further operations.|46053002|83578000

This type|261664005
of injury
has
been
especially common|72906007
among soldiers
wounded|13924000
by improvised explosive devices|66113009
in the Iraq war.[19]|223608003

Due to technologic advances|86005002
in prosthetics,
amputees|41944006
can
live|419749002
active lives|55561003|224130005
with little restriction.|263856008

Organizations|21139007
such as the Challenged Athletes Foundation|418836005
have
been
developed
to
give|419582001
amputees|41944006
the opportunity to
be
involved|248448006
in athletics
and
adaptive sports|415577004
such as Amputee Soccer.|41944006|88289009

The word amputation|255373000|81723002
is
derived
from the Latin _amputare_,
"to
cut|283396008
away",
from _ambi-_
