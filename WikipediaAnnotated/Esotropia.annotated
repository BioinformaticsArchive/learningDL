*Esotropia|16596007
*
*
is
a form|246176004
of strabismus,|22066006
or
"squint",|22066006
in which one|421379005
or
both eyes|81745001
turns|282987006
inward.|255460003

The condition|260905004
can
be
constantly
present|52101004|246105001
,
or
occur|272120004
intermittently,
and
can
give|419582001
the affected individual|247591002|125676002|247591002|385435006|248448006|125676002|248448006|385435006
a "cross-eyed" appearance.|16596007|386548000|16596007|255412001

Esotropia|16596007
is
sometimes erroneously
called
"lazy eye",|246623008
which
describes
the condition|260905004
of amblyopia?|387742006
a reduction|58294000|260400001|289928003
in vision|281004000
of one|421379005
or
both eyes|81745001
that
is
not
the result|394617004
of any pathological lesion|394595002|29458008
of the visual pathway|49549006|281477002
and
cannot
be
resolved
by the use|277889008|419385000
of corrective lenses.|78076003|181169005

Amblyopia|387742006
can
,
however,
arise|68727004
as a result|394617004
of esotropia|16596007
occurring|272120004
in childhood|68433009
:
In order to
relieve|397855004
symptoms
of diplopia|24982008
or
double vision,|24982008
the child's brain|410601007|12738006|410601007|258335003|160499008|12738006|160499008|258335003
will
ignore
or
"
suppress|245780008
"
the image
from the esotropic eye,|16596007|81745001|16596007|244486005
which
when
allowed
to
continue|255238004
untreated|25265005
will
lead|88488004
to the development|278923009
of amblyopia.|387742006

Treatment options|276239002|416118004
for esotropia|16596007
include|55919000
glasses|50121007
to correct refractive errors|39021009
(
see|281004000
accommodative esotropia|419494007
below
)
,
the use|277889008|419385000
of prisms
and/or
orthoptic exercises|40505001
and/or
eye muscle surgery.|17639001|420419008

_1.|260305007

Right,|24028007
left|7771000
or
alternating_|49572008

Someone
with esotropia|16596007
will
squint|22066006
with
either
the right|24028007
or
the left eye|8966001
but
never
with
both
eyes simultaneously.|81745001|79970003

In a left esotropia,|7771000|16596007
the left eye '|8966001
squints|22066006
',
and
in a right esotropia|24028007|16596007
the right eye '|18944008
squints|22066006
'.

In an alternating esotropia|39837002
the patient|116154003
is
able|371150009
to alternate fixation|49572008|1431002
between their right|24028007
and
left eye|8966001
so
that
at one moment|421379005
the right eye fixates|18944008
and
the left eye|8966001
turns|282987006
inward,|255460003
and
at the next|18769003|255260001
the left eye fixates|8966001
and
the right|24028007
turns|282987006
inward.|255460003

This alteration
between the left|7771000
and
right eye|18944008
is
mostly spontaneously,
but
may
be
voluntary|255375007
in some cases.|398241000|413769002

Where
a patient|116154003
tends
to consistently
fix|102491009
with one eye|421379005|81745001|421379005|244486005
and
squint|22066006
with the other,|74964007
the eye|81745001|244486005
that squints|22066006
is
likely to|2931005
develop
some amblyopia.|387742006

Someone
whose
squint|22066006
alternates|49572008
is
very unlikely to|260358002
develop
amblyopia|387742006
because
both
eyes|81745001
will
receive
equal visual stimulation.|9726003|258061005

It
is
possible to|371930009|60022001
encourage
alternation
through the use|277889008|419385000
of occlusion|25272006|26036001|257885003|263823007
or
patching|257907007
of the 'dominant'
or
'fixing' eye to|246290007
promote
the use|277889008|419385000
of the other.|74964007

Esotropia|16596007
is
a highly prevalent congenital condition.|75540009|6160004|260905004|75540009|255399007|260905004

Concomitant|79970003
versus
incomitant_

Esotropias|16596007
can
be
concomitant,|79970003
where the size|277049003
of the deviation|263739008|40885006
does
not
vary
with direction|260672003
of gaze?|246772007
or
incomitant,
where the direction|260672003
of gaze|246772007
does
affect|4065008
the size,|277049003
or
indeed presence,|386397008
of the esotropia.|16596007

The majority
of esotropias|16596007
are
concomitant|79970003
and
begin|255395001
early|264499004
in childhood,|68433009
typically
between the ages|424144002
of 2|260306008
to 4 years.|260308009|258707000

Incomitant esotropias|246747007
occur|272120004
both
in childhood|68433009
and
adulthood|41847000
as a result|394617004
of neurological, mechanical|1199008|261018001
or
myogenic problems|55607006
affecting|247591002|248448006
the muscles|91727004
controlling|54776003|31509003
eye movements.

or
consecutive_

Concomitant esotropias|79970003|16596007
can
arise|68727004
as an initial problem,|884001|55607006|232714002|55607006
in which case|398241000
they
are
designated
as 'Primary',|63161005|261424001
as
a consequence|103332005
of loss
or
impairment|40226000
of vision,|281004000
in which case|398241000
they
are
designated
as 'Secondary',|2603003|81170007
or
following|255260001
overcorrection
of an initial Exotropia|884001|399054005|232714002|399054005
in which case|398241000
they
are
described
as
being
'Consecutive'.

The vast majority
of esotropias|16596007
are
primary.|63161005|261424001

Concomitant esotropia|79970003|16596007
can
itself
be
subdivided
into esotropias|16596007
that
are
ether _constant_,|3601005
or
_intermittent_.|7087005

_1.|260305007

Constant esotropia_|16596007

A constant esotropia,|16596007
as
the name
implies
,
is
present|52101004|246105001
all the time,|410669006
with
and
without glasses,|50121007
if
worn,
and
at all fixation distances.|1431002|246132006

It
may
,
however
have
an accommodative element|251776000|57795002
(i.e.|42146005|22971001

be
influenced
by the exertion|19487008
of accommodative|251776000
or
'focusing' effort|251776000|19487008
)
when
looking|386548000
at close objects,|29179001|260787004
and
this
will
lead|88488004
to the esotropia|16596007
being
more noticeable|242762006
when
the affected individual looks|247591002|125676002|386548000|247591002|385435006|386548000|248448006|125676002|386548000|248448006|385435006|386548000
at objects|260787004
close|29179001
to them.

_2.|260306008

Intermittent esotropia_|27590007

Intermittent esotropias,|27590007
again
as the name
implies
,
are
not always
present|52101004|246105001
:
They
may
be
visible|24054004
when
looking|386548000
at close objects|29179001|260787004
but
not
when
looking|386548000
at distant ones|261007001|421379005
(Near Esotropia|313154006
)
or
,
rarely,|103356009
when
looking|386548000
at distant objects|261007001|260787004
but
not
at close ones|29179001|421379005
(Distance Esotropia|313155007
).

In very rare cases,|260358002|84638005|398241000|260358002|84638005|413769002|260358002|103356009|398241000|260358002|103356009|413769002
they
may
only
occur|272120004
in repeated cycles|27582007|44180009
of 'one day|421379005|258703001|421379005|259032004
on,
one day|421379005|258703001|421379005|259032004
off'
(Cyclic Esotropia|313156008
).

However,
the vast majority
of intermittent esotropias|27590007
are
accommodative|251776000
in origin.|255395001

_Accommodative esotropia_|419494007
is
often|70232002
seen
in patients|116154003
with moderate amounts|6736007|107651007
of hyperopia.|38101003

The hyperope,
in an attempt
to "accommodate"
or
focus|87017008|363702006
the eyes,|81745001
converges
the eyes|81745001
as well,|20572008
as
convergence|263727000|408745006
is
associated|47429007
with activation
of the accommodation reflex.

The over-convergence|21481007|263727000|21481007|408745006
associated|47429007
with the extra accommodation|251776000
required
to
overcome
a hyperopic refractive error|38101003|39021009
can
precipitate
a loss
of binocular control|31509003
and
lead|88488004
to the development|278923009
of esotropia.|16596007

The chances
of an esotropia|16596007
developing
in these cases|398241000|413769002
will
depend
to some degree|258395000|246173007
on the amount|107651007
of hyperopia present.|38101003|52101004|38101003|246105001

Where
the degree|258395000|246173007
of error
is
small,|255507004
the child|410601007|160499008
will
typically
be
able to|371150009
maintain|385630006
control|31509003
because
the amount|107651007
of over-accommodation|251780005
required
to
produce
clear vision|263707001|281004000
is
also small.|255507004

Where
the degree|258395000|246173007
of hyperopia|38101003
is
large,|255509001
the child|410601007|160499008
may
not
be
able to|371150009
produce
clear vision|263707001|281004000
no matter
how
much extra-accommodation|251776000
is
exerted|19487008
and
thus
no incentive
exists
for the over-accommodation|251780005
and
convergence|263727000|408745006
that
can
give|419582001
rise
to the onset|77374008
of esotropia.|16596007

However,
where
the degree|258395000|246173007
of error
is
small enough to|255507004
allow
the child to|410601007|160499008
generate
clear vision|263707001|281004000
by over-accommodation,|251780005
but
large enough to|255509001
disrupt
their binocular control,|31509003
esotropia|16596007
will
result.|394617004

Where
the esotropia|16596007
is
solely
a consequence|103332005
of uncorrected hyperopic refractive error,|38101003|39021009
providing
the child|410601007|160499008
with the correct glasses|50121007
and
ensuring
that
these
are
worn
all the time,|410669006
is
often enough to|70232002
control|31509003
the deviation.|263739008|40885006

In such cases,|398241000|413769002
known|36692007
as 'fully accommodative esotropias',|232101009
the esotropia|16596007
will
only
be
seen
when
the child|410601007|160499008
removes|127485006
their glasses.|50121007

Many adults|260396001|133936004
with childhood esotropias|68433009|16596007
of this type|261664005
make
use|277889008|419385000
of contact lenses to|57368009
control|31509003
their 'squint'.|22066006

A second type|81170007|261664005|257997001|261664005|288495006|261664005
of accommodative esotropia also|419494007
exists
,
known|36692007
as 'convergence excess esotropia'.|427113002

In this condition|260905004
the child|410601007|160499008
exerts|19487008
excessive accommodative convergence|260378005|251776000|263727000|260378005|251776000|408745006
relative|125677006|29920004
to their accommodation.|251776000

Thus,
in such cases,|398241000|413769002
even
when
all
underlying|255546002
hyperopic refractive errors|38101003|39021009
have
been
corrected|370975003
,
the child|410601007|160499008
will
continue|255238004
to
squint|22066006
when
looking|386548000
at very small objects|260358002|255507004|260787004
or
reading small print.|50360004|255507004

Even
though
they
are
exerting|19487008
a normal amount|17621005|107651007|258744000|107651007
of accommodative|251776000
or
'focusing' effort,|251776000|19487008
the amount|107651007
of convergence|263727000|408745006
associated|47429007
with this effort|19487008
is
excessive, thus|260378005
giving|419582001
rise
to esotropia.|16596007

In such cases|398241000|413769002
an additional hyperopic correction|260364009|38101003
is
often|70232002
prescribed
in the form|246176004
of bifocal lenses,|397285001
to
reduce|260400001
the degree|258395000|246173007
of accommodation,|251776000
and
hence convergence,|263727000|408745006
being
exerted.|19487008

Many children|260396001|410601007|260396001|160499008
will
gradually
learn|69998004
to
control|31509003
their esotropias,|16596007
sometimes
with the
help
of orthoptic exercises.|40505001

However,
others|74964007
will
eventually
require
extra-ocular muscle surgery to|67833000|83578000
resolve
their problems.|55607006

_Congenital esotropia_,|232093001
or
_infantile esotropia_,|3658006|16596007|263784005|16596007
is
a specific sub-type|69658003|261089000|261664005|69658003|118555000|261664005
of primary concomitant esotropia.|232097000|79970003

It
is
a constant esotropia|16596007
of large|255509001
and
consistent size|385433004|277049003
with onset|77374008
between birth|3950001
and
six months|422218008|258706009
of age.|424144002

It
is
not
associated|47429007
with hyperopia,|38101003
so
the exertion|19487008
of accommodative effort|424804007
will
not significantly
affect|4065008
the angle|1483009
of deviation.|263739008|40885006

It
is
,
however,
associated|47429007
with other ocular dysfunctions|74964007|81745001|386585008|74964007|281004000|386585008|74964007|386585008

as a consequence|103332005
of the infantile esotropes tendency|3658006|263784005
to 'cross fixate'.

Cross fixation|1431002
involves|248448006
the use|277889008|419385000
of the right eye to|18944008
look|386548000
to the left|7771000
and
the left eye to|8966001
look|386548000
to the right|24028007
;
a visual|255374006
pattern|272135003
that
will
be
'natural'|510009
for the large angle esotrope|255509001|1483009
whose eye|81745001|244486005
is
already
deviated|263739008
towards the opposing side.|182353008

The origin|255395001
of the condition|260905004
is
unknown|261665006
,
and
its early onset means|264499004|77374008|255586005
that
the affected individuals potential|247591002|125676002|30207005|247591002|385435006|30207005|248448006|125676002|30207005|248448006|385435006|30207005
for developing binocular vision|68362006
is
limited.|255469002

The appropriate treatment approach|276239002|416118004
remains
a matter
of some debate.

Some ophthalmologists|422234006
favour
an early surgical approach|264499004|424876005
as offering
the best prospect
of binocularity
whilst
others|74964007
remain
unconvinced
that
the prospects
of achieving
this result|394617004
are
good enough to|20572008
justify
the increased complexity|35105006|103360007|260366006|103360007
and
risk|30207005
associated|47429007
with
operating
on those under the age|261089000|424144002
of one year.|421379005|258707000|421379005|259039008

Incomitant esotropias|246747007
are
conditions|260905004
in which
the esotropia|16596007
varies
in size|277049003
with direction|260672003
of gaze.|246772007

They
can
occur|272120004
in
both
childhood|68433009
and
adulthood,|41847000
and
arise|68727004
as a result|394617004
of neurological, mechanical|1199008|261018001
or
myogenic problems.|55607006

These problems|55607006
may
directly
affect|4065008
the extra-ocular muscles|67833000
themselves,
and
may
also
result|394617004
from conditions|260905004
affecting|247591002|248448006
the nerve|3057000|256864008
or
blood supply|87612001|425398004|119273009|425398004
to these muscles|91727004
or
the bony orbital structures|272673000|263826004
surrounding|355648006
them.

Examples
of conditions|260905004
giving|419582001
rise
to an esotropia|16596007
might
include|55919000
a VIth cranial nerve|25238003|244447006
(
or
Abducens
)
palsy,|44695005
Duane's syndrome|60318001
or
orbital injury.|263826004

The prognosis|20481000
for each esotrope
will
depend
upon the origin|255395001
and
classification|73504009
of their condition.|260905004

However,
in general, management|60132005|413454004|60132005|119270007
will
take|419652001
the following course|255260001|288524001
:

1.

Identify|7882003
and
treat|395077000
any
underlying|255546002
systemic condition.|31099001|260905004

2.

Prescribe
any glasses|50121007
required
and
allow
the patient time|116154003|410669006
to 'settle|128719006
into'
them.

3.

Use occlusion to|277889008|25272006|277889008|26036001|277889008|257885003|277889008|263823007|419385000|25272006|419385000|26036001|419385000|257885003|419385000|263823007
treat|395077000
any amblyopia present|387742006|52101004|387742006|246105001
and
encourage
alternation.

4.

Where appropriate, orthoptic exercises|40505001
can
be
used|394850002
to
attempt
to
restore
binocularity.

5.

Where appropriate, prismatic correction
can
be
used|394850002
,
either
temporarily
or
permanently,
to
relieve|397855004
symptoms
of double vision.|24982008

6.

In specific cases,|69658003|398241000|69658003|413769002
and
primarily
in adult patients,|133936004|116154003
botulinum toxin|419254007|404909007
can
be
used|394850002
either
as a permanent therapeutic approach,|6934004|262202000
or
as a temporary measure to|14803004|246445000|14803004|272391002
prevent
contracture|55033002
of muscles|91727004
prior to surgery|83578000

7.

Where necessary, extra-ocular muscle surgery|67833000|83578000
can
be
undertaken
to
improve|385425000|3442003|385633008
cosmesis|81024003|261513001
and
,
on occasion,|84638005
restore
binocularity.
