is
a localized, blood-filled balloon-|255471002|87612001|255471002|87612001|47006006|255471002|87612001|34263000|255471002|119273009|255471002|119273009|47006006|255471002|119273009|34263000
like bulge|442672001
in the wall|224727009
of a blood vessel.|59820001|361097006

Aneurysms|432119003
can
commonly
occur|272120004
in arteries|51114001|11527006
at the base
of the brain|12738006|258335003
(
the circle of Willis|11279006
and
an aortic aneurysm|67362008
occurs|272120004
in the main artery carrying blood|63161005|4635002|288345009
from the left ventricle|87878005|244385005
of the heart.|80891009|302509004

When
the size|277049003
of an aneurysm increases,|432119003|260366006
there
is
a significant risk|386134007|30207005
of rupture,|415747007
resulting|42752001
in severe hemorrhage,|24484000|131148009
other complications|116223007
or
death.|419620001|268923008

Aneurysms|432119003
can
be
hereditary|255404009
or
caused|23981006|134198009
by disease,|64572001
both
of which
cause|23981006|134198009
the wall|224727009
of the blood vessel|59820001|361097006
to weaken.

Aneurysms|432119003
may
be
classified|73504009
by type,|261664005
location,|246267002
and
the affected vessel.|247591002|59820001|248448006|59820001

Other factors|74964007
may
also
influence
the pathology|394595002
and
diagnosis|439401001
of aneurysms.|432119003

A true aneurysm|31874001|432119003
is
one|421379005
that
involves|248448006
all three layers|421291004
of the wall|224727009
of an artery|51114001|11527006
(intima,|8361002
media|61695000
and
adventitia.|30180000

True aneurysms|31874001|432119003
include|55919000
atherosclerotic, syphilitic,|263891000
and
congenital aneurysms,|282036005
as well as
ventricular aneurysms|90539001
that
follow|367409002|421939007
transmural myocardial infarctions|103354007|22298006
(aneurysms|432119003
that
involve|248448006
all layers
of the attenuated wall|24588000|224727009
of the heart|80891009|302509004
are
also
considered
true aneurysms|31874001|432119003
).[2]|260306008

A false aneurysm|58780002|443089001
or
pseudo-aneurysm|64100000|432119003
does
not primarily
involve|248448006
such distortion|20967005
of the vessel.|59820001

It
is
a collection
of blood|87612001|119273009
leaking|87952002
completely
out of an artery|51114001|11527006
or
vein,|29092000|181367001
but
confined
next to|18769003
the vessel|59820001
by the surrounding tissue.|355648006|85756007

This blood-filled cavity|87612001|80967001|87612001|91806002|87612001|2483006|119273009|80967001|119273009|91806002|119273009|2483006
will
eventually
either
thrombose|118927008
(clot|387325003|75753009
)
enough to
seal|19314006|106980009
the leak|87952002
or
rupture|415747007
out of the tougher tissue enclosing|85756007|68947003
it
and
flow freely
between layers
of other tissues|74964007|85756007
or
into looser tissues.|78799005|85756007

Pseudoaneurysms|58780002|443089001
can
be
caused|23981006|134198009
by trauma
that
punctures|11639007|85921004
the artery|51114001|11527006
and
are
a known complication|36692007|116223007|36692007|263718001
of percutaneous arterial procedures,|103388001|118805000
such as arteriography,|129118002
arterial grafting,|261240000
or
use|277889008|419385000
of an artery|51114001|11527006
for injection.|28289002|385218009|129326001

Like true aneurysms,|31874001|432119003
they
may
be
felt|285854004
as an abnormal pulsatile mass|263654008|255356002|300848003|263654008|255356002|118538004
on palpation.|113011001

Aneurysms|432119003
are
classified|73504009
by their macroscopic shape|255344003|107644003|255344003|246176004|255344003|300842002
and
size|277049003
and
are
described
as
either
saccular|69389007
or
fusiform.|42620005

Saccular aneurysms|54002007
are
spherical|34258004
in shape|107644003|246176004|300842002
and
involve|248448006
only
a portion|260726005
of the vessel wall|59820001|224727009
;
they
vary
in size|277049003
from 5|264706000|264605009
to 20 cm
(8
in
)
in diameter,|81827009
and
are
often|70232002
filled,
either
partially
or
fully,
by thrombus.|396339007|75753009

Fusiform|42620005
("spindle-shaped"|107644003|300842002
)
aneurysms|432119003
are
variable|255372005
in
both
their diameter|81827009
and
length|410668003
;
their diameters|81827009
can
extend|255590007
up to 20 cm
(8
in
).

They often|70232002
involve|248448006
large portions|255509001|260726005
of the ascending|79458005
and
transverse aortic arch,|62824007|57034009|62824007|181300001|243899009|57034009|243899009|181300001
the abdominal aorta,|7832008|244231007
or
less frequently|276139006|70232002|263796003|70232002
the iliac arteries.|10293006

The shape|107644003|246176004|300842002
of an aneurysm|432119003
is
not pathognomonic
for a specific disease.[3]|69658003|64572001

Cerebral aneurysms,
also
known|36692007
as intracranial|303231004
or
brain aneurysms,|12738006|432119003|258335003|432119003
occur|272120004
most commonly
in the anterior cerebral artery,|60176003|181309000
which
is
part|260726005
of the circle of Willis.|11279006

The next most common sites|18769003|72906007|10546003|255260001|72906007|10546003
of cerebral aneurysm occurrence|272120004
are
in the internal carotid artery.[4]|86117002

Many non-intracranial aneurysms|128609009
arise|68727004
distal|46053002
to the origin|255395001
of the renal arteries|2841007
at the infrarenal abdominal aorta,|181304005
a condition|260905004
some
have
postulated
to
be
related|272151006|262094002
to atherosclerosis.|38716007

However,
increasing|260369004
evidence|18669006
suggests
abdominal aortic aneurysms|233985008
are
a wholly separate pathology.|263869007|394595002

The thoracic aorta|302510009|113262008
can
also
be
involved.|248448006

One common form|421379005|72906007|246176004
of thoracic aortic aneurysm|433068007|253646008
involves|248448006
widening|90522003
of the proximal aorta|40415009|261051005|40415009|181298001
and
the aortic root,|8128003
which
leads|88488004|236874000
to aortic insufficiency.|60234000

Aneurysms|432119003
can
also
occur|272120004
in the legs,|30021000
particularly
in the deep vessels|131197000|59820001
(
e.g.
,
the popliteal vessels|312531004
in the knee|304679005|49076000|361291001|72696002
).

Arterial aneurysms|233981004
are
much more common,|242762006|72906007|4757001|72906007
but
venous aneurysms|234081006
do
happen
(
for example,
the popliteal venous aneurysm|56849005|432119003|281065001|432119003|255580004|234081006
).

Incidence rates
of cranial aneurysms|128609009
are
estimated|414135002
at
between 0.4%
and
3.6%.|260281002

Those without risk factors|45169001|80943009

develop
after the age|424144002
of 40.|259031006

Pediatric aneurysms|394537008|432119003
have
different incidences|263735002
and
features
than adult aneurysms.|133936004|432119003

Intracranial aneurysms|128609009
are
rare|84638005|103356009
in childhood,|68433009
with over 95%|21481007

Numerous animal experiments|260396001|387961004

of zinc|86739005
can
lead|88488004
to deficiency|260372006|248325000
of copper|422528000
(hypocupremia|19577007
).

This deficiency happens|260372006|248325000
because
excess zinc|260378005|86739005
in the body|279495008|123037004
triggers
reduced absorption|260400001
of copper|422528000
in the GI tract,|122865005
resulting|42752001
in increased fecal loss|35105006|39477002|260366006|39477002
of copper.[17]|422528000

Aneurysm formation|432119003|11798007|432119003|255277001
is
probably
the result|394617004
of multiple factors|260396001
affecting|247591002|248448006
that arterial segment|51114001|264193005|263954005|264193005
and
its local environment.|255470001|276339004
Many aneurysms|260396001|432119003
are
atherosclerotic
in nature.|277302009

The occurrence|272120004
and
expansion
of an aneurysm|432119003
in a given segment|264193005
of the arterial tree|51114001|22097005|263954005|22097005
involves|248448006
local hemodynamic factors|255470001
and
factors
intrinsic|260521003|255406006
to the arterial segment|51114001|264193005|263954005|264193005
itself.

The aorta|261051005|181298001
is
a relatively low-resistance circuit|62482003|30714006|371880002|30714006
for circulating blood.|256914002

The lower extremities|61685007
have
higher arterial resistance,|75540009|251271006|371879000|251271006
and
the repeated trauma|27582007|27582007
of a reflected arterial wave|225436004|51114001|225436004|263954005
on the distal aorta|46053002|261051005|46053002|181298001
may
injure
a weakened aortic wall|261051005|224727009
and
contribute
to aneurysmal degeneration.|255378009|33359002

Systemic hypertension compounds|38341003|62105006
the injury,
accelerates|14355007
the expansion
of known aneurysms,|36692007|432119003
and
may
contribute
to their formation.|11798007|255277001

Increasing|260369004
aneurysmal dilatation|432119003
leads|88488004|236874000
to increasing arterial wall tension|260369004|51114001|224727009|53489000|260369004|263954005|224727009|53489000
or
stress.|262188008

In hemodynamic terms,
the coupling
of aneurysmal dilatation|432119003
and
increased wall stress|23085004|224727009
is
approximated|26175008
by the law
of Laplace.

The Law
of Laplace
applied|410618006
to a cylinder|337535009
states|398070004
that
the
(arterial|51114001|263954005
)
wall tension|224727009|53489000
is
equal|9726003
to the pressure|279046003|13543005|257893003
times the radius|62413002|181940002|131190003
of the arterial conduit|51114001|257281002|263954005|257281002
divided|422033008
by wall thickness|224727009|246703001
(T
= [P x R]/t|20304007|16162007
).

As diameter increases,|81827009|260366006
wall tension increases,|224727009|53489000|260366006
which
contributes
to more
increase|260366006
in diameter|81827009
and
risk|30207005
of rupture.|415747007

Increased blood pressure|38341003|24184005
(systemic hypertension|38341003
)
and
increased aneurysm size|15454001|432119003
increase|260366006
arterial wall tension|51114001|224727009|53489000|263954005|224727009|53489000
and
therefore
increase|260366006
the risk|30207005
of rupture.|415747007

Wall thickness|224727009|246703001
is
decreased|1250004|260400001|260371004
in aneurysms|432119003
and
further adds|46053002
to the increase|260366006
in wall tension.|224727009|53489000

In addition,|260364009
the vessel wall|59820001|224727009
is
supplied|425398004
by the blood|87612001|119273009
within its lumen|113342003|342806003|398252006
in humans|278412004
in a developing aneurysm,|432119003
the most ischemic portion|4757001|255426005|260726005
of the aneurysm|432119003
is
at the farthest end,|46053002|261782000|46053002|422117008
resulting|42752001
in weakening
of the vessel wall there|59820001|224727009
and
aiding further expansion|62479008|46053002|246088000|46053002
of the aneurysm.|432119003

Thus eventually
all aneurysms|432119003
will
,
if
left|7771000
to
complete|255594003
their evolution,
rupture|415747007
without intervention.|225334002

A mycotic aneurysm|233991005
is
an aneurysm|432119003
that results|394617004
from an infectious process|441862004
that
involves|248448006
the arterial wall.|51114001|224727009|263954005|224727009

A person|125676002
with a mycotic aneurysm|233991005
has
a bacterial infection|301811001
in the wall|224727009
of an artery,|51114001|11527006
resulting|42752001
in the formation|11798007|255277001
of an aneurysm.|432119003

The most common locations|4757001|72906007|246267002
include|55919000
arteries|51114001|11527006
in the abdomen,|277112006|52731004|302553009
thigh,|68367000|302544002
neck,|45048000|302550007
and
arm.|40983000|53120007|182245002|302538001

A mycotic aneurysm|233991005
can
result|394617004
in sepsis,|105592009|91302008
or
life threatening|224130005
bleeding|131148009
if
the aneurysm ruptures.|432119003|415747007

Less
than 3%|260313008
of abdominal aortic aneurysms|233985008
are
mycotic aneurysms.[19]|233991005

While
most aneurysms|432119003
occur|272120004
in an isolated form,|46651001|246176004
the occurrence|272120004
of berry aneurysms|277196008
of the anterior communicating artery|8012006|181311009
of the circle of Willis|11279006
is
associated with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD).|47429007|28728008

This type|261664005
of aneurysm places|432119003|257557008
pressure|279046003|13543005|257893003
on the surrounding brain tissue,|355648006|256865009|355648006|280369009
causing|23981006
it
to malfunction.|76797004|386585008

A rupture|415747007
of this cerebral brain tissue,|256865009|280369009
would
cause|23981006|134198009
excessive bleeding|260378005|131148009
around the brain,|12738006|258335003
called
a subarachnoid hemorrhage.|21454007

Severe bleeding|24484000|131148009
can
cause|23981006|134198009
brain damage|2470005
and
lead|88488004
to permanent disability.[20]|6934004|21134002

The third stage|258224005
of syphilis also|76272004
manifests|250255003
as aneurysm|432119003
of the aorta,|261051005|181298001
which
is
due to loss
of the vasa vasorum|340365001|7524009
in the tunica adventitia.|30180000

Diagnosis|439401001
of a ruptured cerebral aneurysm|233983001
is
commonly
made
by finding signs|404684003|72670004|72670004
of subarachnoid hemorrhage|21454007
on a computed tomography (CT) scan.|77477000|373205008|77477000

If
the CT scan|77477000
is
negative|260385009
but
a ruptured aneurysm|22039006
is
still
suspected|415684004
based|418836005
on clinical findings,|404684003
a lumbar puncture|277762005|265232001
can
be
performed|398166005
to
detect|260373001
blood|87612001|119273009
in the cerebrospinal fluid.|65216001

Computed tomography angiography (CTA)|418272005
is
an alternative
to traditional angiography|263901007|77343006
and
can
be
performed|398166005
without the need|410525008|103325001
for arterial catheterization.|392247006

This test|269814003|272393004
combines|20909006
a regular CT scan|17854005|77477000
with a contrast dye|61789006
injected|422145002
into a vein.|29092000|181367001

Once the dye|61789006
is
injected|422145002
into a vein,|29092000|181367001
it travels|420008001
to the cerebral arteries,|88556005
and
images
are
created
using|260676000
a CT scan.|77477000

These images
show
exactly
how
blood|87612001|119273009
flows
into the brain arteries.|12738006|51114001|12738006|11527006|258335003|51114001|258335003|11527006

Symptoms
for a cerebral aneurysm
occur|272120004
when
the aneurysm pushes|432119003|303365000

Historically,
the treatment|276239002|416118004
of arterial aneurysms|233981004
has
been
limited|255469002
to
either
surgical intervention,|83578000
or
watchful waiting|103705002
in combination|89780004
with control|31509003
of blood pressure.|75367002|392570002|386536003

In recent years,|6493001|258707000
endovascular
or
minimally invasive techniques|10179008|272394005
have
been
developed
for many types|261664005
of aneurysms.|432119003

There
are
currently two treatment options|15240007|420797005|276239002|15240007|420797005|416118004
for brain aneurysms|12738006|432119003|258335003|432119003
:
surgical clipping|83578000|21147007|83578000|360017003
or
endovascular coiling.|261363007

There
is
currently|15240007
debate
in the medical literature|74188005
about which treatment|276239002|416118004
is
most appropriate given particular situations.|4757001

Surgical clipping|83578000|21147007|83578000|360017003
was
introduced|127487003
by Walter Dandy
of the Johns Hopkins Hospital|285201006
in 1937.

It
consists
a craniotomy to|25353009
expose|24932003
the aneurysm|432119003
and
closing|29179001
the base
of the aneurysm|432119003
with a clip.|77720000

The surgical technique|83578000|272394005
has
been
modified|243326001
and
improved|385425000|3442003
over the years.|258707000

Endovascular coiling|261363007
was
introduced|127487003
by Guido Guglielmi
at UCLA
in 1991.

It
consists
of passing
a catheter|19923001
into the femoral artery|7657000|244332003
in the groin,|255575008
through the aorta,|261051005|181298001
into the brain arteries,|12738006|51114001|12738006|11527006|258335003|51114001|258335003|11527006
and
finally
into the aneurysm|432119003
itself.

Platinum coils|84847000|261363007
initiate
a clotting reaction|263851003
within the aneurysm|432119003
that,
if
successful,|385669000
will
eliminate
the aneurysm.|432119003

For aneurysms|432119003
in the aorta,|261051005|181298001
arms,|40983000
legs,|30021000
or
head,|69536005|302548004
the weakened section|62083003|118630004
of the vessel|59820001
may
be
replaced|282089006|370124000
by a bypass
graft|260667007|24486003|119561005
that
is
sutured|408099007|29684008
at the vascular stumps.|59820001|38033009

Instead of sewing,
the graft tube ends,|260667007|83059008|261782000|24486003|83059008|261782000|119561005|83059008|261782000
made
rigid|16046003|261026009
and
expandable
by nitinol wireframe,
can
be
easily|36203004
inserted|257867005
in its reduced diameter|260400001|81827009
into the vascular stumps|59820001|38033009
and
then
expanded|70955005
up to the most appropriate diameter|4757001|81827009
and
permanently
fixed|102491009|261010008
there
by external ligature.|261074009|59432006

New devices|7147002|303607000|7147002|49062001
were
recently|6493001
developed
to
substitute
the external ligature|261074009|59432006
by expandable ring allowing use|112627000|277889008|112627000|419385000|257380004|277889008|257380004|419385000
in acute ascending aorta dissection,|272118002|54247002|122459003|272118002|181299009|122459003|272118002|79458005|308546005
providing
airtight
(i.e.|42146005|22971001
