is
a kidney cancer|363518003
that
originates
in the lining|50009006
of the proximal convoluted tubule,|50468005
the very small tubes|260358002|255507004|83059008|260358002|255507004|418530008
in the kidney|64033007|17373004|181414000
that
filter|116250002|258648006
the blood|87612001|119273009
and
remove|127485006
waste products.|289925000

RCC|41607009
is
the most common type|4757001|72906007|261664005
of kidney cancer|363518003
in adults,|133936004
responsible|394851003
for approximately 80%|26175008
of cases.|398241000|413769002

It
is
also
known|36692007
to
be
the most lethal|4757001
of all
the genitourinary tumors._[citation|21514008|108369006

is
most commonly|4757001
a radical|32948009|255612005
or
partial nephrectomy|81516001
and
remains
the mainstay
of curative treatment.

Where
the tumor|108369006
is
confined
to the renal parenchyma,|29704000
the 5-year survival rate|264706000|258707000|264706000|259039008|264605009|258707000|264605009|259039008
is
60-70%,
but
this
is
lowered considerably|261122009|385440003
where metastases|128462008
have
spread.|410677005

It
is
relatively resistant|30714006
to radiation therapy|108290001
and
chemotherapy,|416608005|367336001
although
some cases|398241000|413769002
respond
to immunotherapy.|76334006

Targeted cancer therapies|363346000|276239002|372087000|276239002
such as sunitinib,|421192001
temsirolimus,|427153004
bevacizumab,|409406007
interferon-alpha,|45754009
and
sorafenib|422042001
have
improved|385425000|3442003
the outlook|225464009
for RCC|41607009
(progression-free survival|246453008|37837009|246450006|37837009
)
,
although
they
have
not yet
demonstrated
improved survival.|385425000|3442003

A wide range|90522003
of symptoms
can
be
present|52101004|246105001
with renal carcinoma|41607009
depending
on which areas|42798000
of the body|279495008|123037004
have
been
affected.|247591002|248448006

The classic triad|255301002|255333006
is
hematuria|53298000
(blood|87612001|119273009
in the urine|78014005
)
,
flank pain|247355005
and
an abdominal mass.|271860004

This triad only
occurs|272120004
in 10-15%
of cases,|398241000|413769002
and
is
generally indicative
of more advanced disease.|242762006|86005002|64572001

Today,
the majority
of renal tumors|126880001
are
asymptomatic|84387000
and
are
detected|260373001
incidentally
on imaging, usually|363679005|278395004
for an unrelated cause.|262241003|134198009

Signs|72670004

in classifying renal cell carcinoma.|73504009|41607009

The following system|255260001|246333005
can
be
used|394850002
to
classify|73504009
these tumors|108369006
:
[10][11][12]

Renal epithelial neoplasms|126880001
have
characteristic cytogenetic aberrations|409709004

to
identify|7882003
characteristic chromosomal aberrations|409709004
in renal tumors|126880001
with challenging morphology.|116676008|72724002

The incidence
of renal cell cancer|41607009
has
been
rising
steadily.

Nearly 51190 new diagnoses|441308009
and
12890 deaths|419620001|268923008
reported|229059009|223458004
in the United States|223688001
in 2007.

It
is
more common|242762006|72906007
in men|339947000
than women|224526002
:
the male-to-female ratio|248153007|248152002|118586006|248153007|224526002|118586006
is
1.6|260305007
:
1
and
has
been
decreasing|260371004
over the last decade.

Blacks|315240009
have
a slightly higher rate|425404009|75540009|425404009|371879000
of renal cell cancer|41607009
than whites.|413773004|185984009

The reasons|410666004
for this
are
not
clear.|263707001

Note
:
in epidemiology,
RCC|41607009
is
registered|229053005
together with renal pelvis carcinoma,|41607009|277113001|41607009|21844003|41607009|229765004|277113001|21844003|229765004|25990002|68453008
which
is
predominantly transitional cell type.|4421005|246238003

In Europe|223502009
the incidence
of RCC|41607009
has
doubled|1305003
in the period|259037005
from 1975
to 2005.

RCC|41607009
accounted
for 3777 deaths|419620001|268923008
in the UK
in 2006
;
male 2372,|248153007
female 1820.[19][20][21]|248152002|224526002

Cigarette smoking|102408007
and
obesity|414915002
are
considered
the leading cause|236874000|134198009
and
strongest known risk factors.|260404005|36692007|80943009

Hypertension|38341003
and
a family history|57177007
of the disease|64572001
are
also risk factors.|80943009

Occupational exposure|87923000|71677004|87923000|24932003
to cadmium|66586000
is
a risk factor.|80943009

Dialysis patients|108241001|116154003|265764009|116154003
with acquired cystic disease|9834002|441457006|9834002|20476009|255396000
of the kidney|64033007|17373004|181414000
showed
a 30 times greater risk|410669006|263768009|30207005|417929005|263768009|30207005
than
in the general population|60132005|385436007|60132005|389109008
for developing RCC.[23]|41607009|264657009

Exposure|71677004|24932003
to asbestos,|16369005
polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons,|34862004
gasoline|31086004
has
not
been
shown
to
be
consistently
associated|47429007
with RCC risk.[24]|41607009|30207005

Patients|116154003
with certain inherited disorders|17162000|255404009|64572001
such as von Hippel-Lindau disease,|46659004
hereditary papillary renal cancer,|255404009|77526009|363518003|255404009|77526009
a hereditary leiomyoma RCC syndrome|255404009|41607009|255404009|95315005|41607009
and
Birt-Hogg-Dub? syndrome,
show
an enhanced risk|30207005
of RCC.|41607009

Also,
patients|116154003
with sickle cell trait|16402000
are
predisposed
to developing Renal medullary carcinoma.|128669006

Hysterectomy|236886002
is
associated|47429007
with an approximately doubled risk.|26175008|1305003|30207005

Hormonal factors|278994005
or
injury
of the ureter|264254009|302511008
during surgery|83578000
were
considered
as possible causes.[28][29]|371930009|134198009|60022001|134198009

Non-aspirin NSAIDs|387458008|372665008
were
associated|47429007
with a relative risk|125677006|30207005|29920004|30207005
of 1.51|260305007
(95%CI
:
1.12-2.04|303183002
)
and
a long term dose-response relationship|277406006|272151006|408102007|272151006
was
found|404684003
in a prospective study.[30]|110465008|224699009

An accurate diagnosis|263656005|439401001|263656005
may
be
difficult to|52925006
establish|263748003
given|419582001
that
the early stages|264499004|261612004
of renal cancer|363518003
are
asymptomatic.|84387000

Renal tumors|126880001
are
often|70232002
discovered incidentally
on radiologic imaging|394914008|363679005|394914008|278395004|5526005|363679005|5526005|278395004
performed|398166005
for an unrelated reason.|262241003|410666004

The increase|260366006
in medical|74188005
imaging|363679005|278395004
over the last decades
has
allowed
for the discovery
of early|264499004
stage|21191007|371508000|261612004
renal cancer|363518003
in patients|116154003
who
are
asymptomatic.|84387000

The first steps|255216001|398298007|232714002|398298007
taken|419652001
in order to
diagnose|439401001
this condition|260905004
are
observing
any
of the signs|72670004
and
symptoms,
and
an anamnesis|19993006
(
the detailed medical review|74188005
of past health state|410513005|263775005|398070004
)
to
evaluate
any risk factors.|80943009

Upon physical examination,|5880005
palpation|113011001
of the abdomen|277112006|52731004|302553009
may
reveal|263857004
the presence|386397008
of a mass|300848003|118538004
or
an organ enlargement.[31]|410653004|56246009|264664006|410653004|118452000|264664006|410653004|442021009|264664006

However,
the main diagnostic tool|8319008|86967005
for detecting renal cell carcinoma|260373001|41607009
is
ultrasound,|359659005
CT scanning|77477000
and
MRI|113091000
of the kidneys.|64033007|17373004

If
the ultrasound|359659005
shows
a mass|300848003|118538004
or
cyst,|441457006|103552005
a subsequent CT|255260001
or
MRI|113091000
with intravenous contrast|255560000
is
the optimal test|269814003|272393004
for diagnosis|439401001
and
staging.[32]|72589006

The characteristic appearance|386548000|255412001
of renal cell carcinoma (RCC)|41607009
is
a solid renal lesion|35702001|64033007|78910004|64033007|421378002|64033007
which
disturbs
the renal contour.|64033007

It
will
frequently|70232002
have
an irregular|49608001
or
lobulated margin.|112233002|82868003|372249001

Traditionally 85
to 90%|264705001|264703008
of solid renal masses|35702001|309088003|78910004|309088003|421378002|309088003
will
turn out to|282987006
be
RCC|41607009
but
this number|410680006|410681005
may
be
decreasing|260371004
as renal masses|309088003
are
being
found|404684003
at smaller|263796003|255507004
and
smaller sizes|263796003|277049003|255507004|277049003
with larger numbers|255509001|410680006|255509001|410681005|263768009|410680006|263768009|410681005
of benign lesions.|30807003

Ten percent|23067006|118582008|420258001|118582008
of RCC|41607009
will
contain|42504009
calcifications,
and
some
contain|42504009
macroscopic fat|255344003|271590003
(likely|2931005
due to invasion|370052007
and
encasement
of the perirenal fat|90399000|246901006
).

Renal cell carcinoma|41607009
may
also
be
cystic.|441457006|20476009

As
there
are
several benign cystic renal lesions|261028005|30807003|441457006|64033007|261028005|30807003|20476009|64033007
(simple renal cyst,|77945009
hemorrhagic renal cyst,|52321009|64033007|255345002|77945009
multilocular cystic nephroma,|128757006
polycystic kidney disease
)
,
it
may
occasionally
be
difficult|52925006
for the radiologist to|66862007
differentiate|263933003
a benign cystic lesion|30807003|441457006|30807003|20476009
from a malignant one.|21594007|421379005

A classification system|73504009
for cystic renal|441457006|64033007|20476009|64033007
lesions
that classifies|73504009
them
based|418836005
specific imaging features|69658003|363679005|69658003|278395004
into groups|261586004|160481000
that
are
benign|30807003
and
those
that
need|410525008|103325001
surgical resection|118292001|128303001
is
available.[33]|103328004|264667004

Percutaneous biopsy|103388001|86273004
can
be
performed|398166005
by a radiologist|66862007
using|260676000
ultrasound|359659005
or
computed tomography to|77477000
guide|106384005|303479009
sampling|257915005
of the tumor|108369006
for the purpose|363675004
of diagnosis|439401001
by pathology.|394595002

However
this
is
not routinely
performed|398166005
because
when
the typical imaging features|363679005|278395004
of renal cell carcinoma|41607009
are
present,|52101004|246105001
the possibility
of an incorrectly negative result|260385009|394617004
together with the risk|30207005
of a medical complication|74188005|116223007|74188005|263718001
to the patient|116154003
may
make
it unfavorable
from a risk-benefit perspective.|30207005

The staging|72589006
of renal cell carcinoma|41607009
is
the most important factor|4757001
in predicting
its prognosis.|20481000

Staging|72589006
can
follow|367409002|421939007
the TNM staging system,|35684008|246231009
where
the size|277049003
and
extent|255590007
of the tumour (T),|108369006
involvement|248448006
of lymph nodes (N)|59441001
and
metastases (M)|128462008
are
classified|73504009
separately.

At diagnosis,|439401001
30%
of renal cell carcinomas|41607009
have
spread|410677005
to the ipsilateral renal vein,|255208005|56400007|255208005|181370002
and
5-10%|264706000|264605009
have
continued|255238004
into the inferior vena cava.[35]|64131007|181369003

The gross|255344003
and
microscopic appearance|84496004|386548000|84496004|255412001
of renal cell carcinomas|41607009
is
highly variable.|75540009|255372005

The following|255260001
describes
a typical clear cell carcinoma,|30546008
which
is
the most common type.|4757001|72906007|261664005

The renal cell carcinoma|41607009
may
present|52101004|246105001
reddened areas|42798000
where blood vessels|59820001
have
bled|131148009
,
and
cysts|441457006
containing|42504009
watery fluids.|263930000|32457005|263930000|33463005

The body|279495008|123037004
of the tumor|108369006
shows
large blood vessels|42586008
that
have
walls|224727009
composed
of cancerous cells.|88400008

Gross examination often|255344003|5880005|70232002
shows
a yellowish,
multilobulated tumor|108369006
in the renal cortex,|50403003
which frequently|70232002
contains|42504009
zones
of necrosis,|6574001
hemorrhage|131148009
and
scarring.|275322007

Light microscopy|104157003
shows
tumor cells|252987004
forming|35810008
cords,
papillae,|69070000|78540008
tubules|95568003|13336003
or
nests,
and
are
atypical, polygonal|112231000|78978000
and
large.|255509001

Also,
the cells|4421005
that make up|255532002|353734004
a renal carcinoma|41607009
may
be
clear, granular,|263707001|15933001
mixed|26242008
clear|263707001
and
granular|15933001
or
sarcomatoid|424952003
or
spindle type.|261664005

Recent studies|6493001|110465008|6493001|224699009
have
brought|68369002
to attention|6769007
that
the type|261664005
of cancerous cells|88400008
and
the aggressiveness|61372001
of the condition|260905004
are
closely
related.|272151006|262094002
Because
these cells|4421005
accumulate
glycogen|36998008
and
lipids,|70106000
their cytoplasm
appear
"
clear|263707001
",
the nuclei|84640000
remain
in the middle|255562008|399488007
of the cells,|4421005
and
the cellular membrane|53982002
is
evident.|18669006

Some cells|4421005
may
be
smaller,|263796003|255507004
with eosinophilic cytoplasm,|14793004|365601007|191357009|419455006|419769007
resembling
normal tubular cells.|4421005|95568003|4421005|13336003|118957004|95568003|118957004|13336003

The stroma
is
reduced,|260400001
but
well|20572008
vascularized.|255451006

The tumor|108369006
compresses|37204000
the surrounding parenchyma,|355648006
producing
a pseudocapsule.[37]

The clear cells|40489007
are
thought|88952004
to
be
the least likely to|276139006|2931005|263796003|2931005
spread|410677005
and
usually
respond
more favorably|242762006
to treatment.|276239002|416118004

However,
most
of the tumors|108369006
contain|42504009
a mixture|272163001
of cells.|4421005

The most aggressive stage|4757001|61372001|21191007|4757001|61372001|371508000|4757001|61372001|261612004|4757001|21191007|4757001|371508000|4757001|261612004
of renal cancer|363518003
is
believed to
be
the one|421379005
in which
the tumor|108369006
is
mixed,|26242008
containing|42504009
both
clear|263707001
and
granular cells.|15933001|4421005

A study|110465008|224699009
in Turkey|278900006|20657003
that
used|394850002
the 1997 AJCC staging system|258236004|246231009
estimated|414135002
the five-year survival rate to|421820001|258707000|421820001|259039008
be
90%|264705001|264703008
for stage I,|258215001
51%
for stage II,|258219007
22%
for stage III|258224005
and
4.6%|260308009
for stage IV.|21191007|371508000|261612004

The same study|262126009|110465008|262126009|224699009
estimated|414135002
the median survival time to|399488007|445320007|260528009|445320007
be
7.7 years|258707000
for stage I,|258215001
5.0 years|264706000|258707000|264605009|258707000
for stage II,|258219007
3.1 years|260313008|258707000
for stage III|258224005
and
1.1 years|260305007|258707000
for stage IV.[39]|21191007|371508000|261612004

For those
that
have
tumor recurrence|25173007
after surgery,|83578000
the prognosis|20481000
is
generally poor.|11403006|255351007

Renal cell carcinoma|41607009
does
not generally
respond
to chemotherapy|416608005|367336001
or
radiation.|30821001|82107009|108290001

Immunotherapy,|76334006
which
attempts
to
induce|16404004
the body to|279495008|123037004
attack|217315002|216299002
the remaining cancer cells,|88400008
has
shown
promise.

Recent trials|6493001|110465008
are
testing newer agents,|7147002|260872001|272393004|7147002|260872001
though
the current complete remission rate|15240007|103338009
with these approaches|103379005
are
still low,|62482003|371880002
around 12-20%
in most series.|13039001

Most recently,|4757001|6493001
treatment|276239002|416118004
with tyrosine kinase inhibitors|372917005
including|55919000
nexavar,
pazopanib,|443764004
and
rapamycin|387014003
have
shown
promise
in improving|385633008
the prognosis|20481000
for advanced RCC since 2004.|86005002|41607009

If
it
is
only
in the kidneys,|64033007|17373004
which
is
about 40%|259031006
of cases,|398241000|413769002
it
can
be
cured
roughly 90%|264705001|264703008
of the time|410669006
with surgery.|83578000

If
it
has
spread|410677005
outside of the kidneys,|64033007|17373004
often|70232002
into the lymph nodes|59441001
or
the main vein|63161005|29092000|63161005|181367001
of the kidney,|64033007|17373004|181414000
then
it
must
be
treated|28995006
with adjunctive therapy,|276239002
including|55919000
cytoreductive surgery.|83578000

RCC|41607009
is
resistant|30714006
to chemotherapy|416608005|367336001
and
radiotherapy|419815003|108290001
in most cases,|398241000|413769002
but
does
respond
well|20572008
to immunotherapy|76334006
with interleukin-2|428693003
or
interferon-alpha,|45754009
biologic,|12893009
or
targeted therapy.|276239002

In early stage cases,|264499004|21191007|398241000|264499004|21191007|413769002|264499004|371508000|398241000|264499004|371508000|413769002|264499004|261612004|398241000|264499004|261612004|413769002
cryotherapy|427357007|26782000
and
surgery|83578000
are
the preferred options.|225773000

IMA901
is
used to|394850002
treat|395077000
patients|116154003
with cancer|363346000|372087000
of the kidneys.|64033007|17373004

It
is
composed
of ten synthetic tumor-associated peptides (TUMAPs),|23067006|108369006|47429007|52642002|420258001|108369006|47429007|52642002
which
activate
the body's own killer T-cells|279495008|420638008|123037004|420638008
against the tumor.|108369006

Unlike chemotherapy,|416608005|367336001
this process|415178003
targets
the body's immune responses|279495008|35024006|123037004|35024006
and
mobilizes|302044006
them to
attack|217315002|216299002
the cancer.|363346000|372087000

Small renal tumors|272418005|64033007|255507004|126880001
(
< 4 cm|260308009
)
are
treated|28995006
increasingly
by way
of partial nephrectomy|81516001
when
possible.|371930009|60022001

Most
of these small renal masses|255507004|309088003
manifest|250255003
indolent biological behavior|12893009|844005
with excellent prognosis.|425405005|20481000

More centers|242762006|26216008
of excellence|425405005
are
incorporating needle biopsy to|129249002
confirm|59156000
the presence|386397008
of malignant histology|21594007|67151002|21594007
prior to recommending definitive surgical extirpation.|261002007|83578000|118292001|261002007|83578000|128303001

In the elderly,|105436006
patients|116154003
with co-morbidities
and
in poor surgical candidates,|11403006|83578000|255351007|83578000
small renal tumors|272418005|64033007|255507004|126880001
may
be
monitored|302805002|13288007
carefully
with serial imaging.|363679005|278395004

Most clinicians conservatively
follow|367409002|421939007
tumors|108369006
up to a size threshold|277049003|118589004
between 3|260313008
and
5 cm,|264706000|264605009
beyond which
the risk|30207005
of distant spread|261007001|410677005
(metastases|128462008
)
is
about 5%.

Cryoablation|427357007
is
used|394850002
in a variety
of clinical applications|58147004|410618006
using|260676000
hollow needles|255347005|79068005
(cryoprobes|261343000
)
through which
cooled
,
thermally conductive, fluids|32457005|33463005
are
circulated.|65929005

Cryoprobes|261343000
are
inserted|257867005
into
or
placed adjacent|257557008|18769003|421066005|18769003
to tissue|85756007
which
is
determined to
be
diseased|64572001
in such
a way
that ablation|257729003|64597002
will
provide
correction yielding benefit
to the patient.|116154003

When
the probes|7402007
are
in place,|257557008|421066005
the cryogenic freezing unit|48103003|258666001
removes|127485006
heat|88999006
("cools"
)
from the tip|233445008
of the probe|7402007
and
by extension|255536004
from the surrounding tissues.|355648006|85756007

The most common application|4757001|72906007|410618006
of cryoablation|427357007
is
to
ablate|127485006
solid tumors|35702001|108369006|78910004|108369006|421378002|108369006
found|404684003
in the lung,|39607008|181216001
liver,|10200004|181268008
breast,|76752008|181131000
kidney|64033007|17373004|181414000
and
prostate.|263847000|181422007

The use|277889008|419385000
in prostate|263847000|181422007
and
renal cryoablation|64033007|427357007
are
the most common.|4757001|72906007

Although
sometimes
applied|410618006
through laparoscopic|108191006
or
open surgical approaches,|129236007|83578000|56116003|424876005
most often cryoablation|70232002|427357007
is
performed percutaneously|398166005
(
through the skin|119325001|39937001|181469002
and
into the target tissue|85756007
containing|42504009
the tumor|108369006
).

Surgical removal|118292001|128303001|128304007
of all
or
part|260726005
of the kidney|64033007|17373004|181414000
(nephrectomy|108022006|175905003
is
recommended.

This
may
include|55919000
removal|118292001|128303001
of the adrenal gland,|23451007|181127006
retroperitoneal lymph nodes,|91394001|249613000
and
possibly tissues|60022001|85756007
involved|248448006
by direct extension|255589003|255536004
(invasion|370052007
)
of the tumor|108369006
into the surrounding tissues.|355648006|85756007

In cases|398241000|413769002
where the tumor|108369006
has
spread|410677005
into the renal vein,|56400007|181370002
inferior vena cava,|64131007|181369003
and
possibly|60022001
the right atrium,|264181001|244383003
this portion|260726005
of the tumor|108369006
can
be
surgically|83578000
removed|127485006
,
as well.|20572008

In cases|398241000|413769002
of known metastases,|36692007|128462008
surgical resection|118292001|128303001
of the kidney|64033007|17373004|181414000
("cytoreductive nephrectomy"|108022006|175905003
)
may
improve|385425000|3442003|385633008
survival,
[44]
as well as
resection|118292001|128303001
of a solitary metastatic lesion.|50607009|77879006

Kidneys|64033007|17373004
are
sometimes
embolized
prior to surgery to|83578000
minimize
blood loss[1]|131148009|250771004
(
see|281004000
image
).

Surgery|83578000
is
increasingly
performed|398166005
via laparoscopic techniques.|108191006|272394005|272394005

These
have
the advantage
of
being
less
of a burden
for the patient|116154003
and
the disease-free survival|64572001|37837009
is
comparable
to that
of open surgery.|129236007

For small exophytic lesions|255507004
that
do
not extensively
involve|248448006
the major vessels|255603008|59820001
or
urinary collecting system,|21514008|122489005
a partial nephrectomy|81516001
(also
referred|439980006
to
as
"nephron sparing surgery"|54018001|83578000|361337001|83578000
)
can
be
performed.|398166005

This
may
involve|248448006
temporarily
stopping|260890000|385654001|422117008
blood flow|58190003
to the kidney|64033007|17373004|181414000
while
the mass|300848003|118538004
is
removed|127485006
as well as
renal cooling|64033007
with an ice slush.|896008

Mannitol|387168006
can
also
be
administered|418283001
to
help
limit damage|255469002|37782003
to the kidney.|64033007|17373004|181414000

This
is
usually
done
through an open incision|56116003|34896006
although
smaller lesions|263796003|255507004
can
be
done
laparoscopically

Typically
a biopsy|86273004

at the time|410669006
of treatment.|276239002|416118004

Intraoperative ultrasound|277671009|359659005
may

of the freezing probes.|48103003|7402007

Two freeze/thaw cycles|420797005|48103003|44180009
are
then
performed to|398166005
kill|248007002
the tumor cells.|252987004

As the tumor|108369006
is
not removed followup|127485006|308273005
is
more
complicated|255302009
(
see|281004000
below
)
and
overall disease free rates|64572001|37837009
are
not
as good|20572008
as those

with localized tumor,|255471002|108369006
but
who
are
not good candidates|20572008
for a surgical procedure.|83578000

This sort
of procedure|71388002
involves|248448006
placing|257557008
a probe|7402007
through the skin|119325001|39937001|181469002
and
into the tumor|108369006
using|260676000
real-time|410669006
imaging|363679005|278395004
of both
the probe tip|7402007|233445008
and
the tumor|108369006
by computed tomography,|77477000
ultrasound,|359659005
or
even magnetic resonance imaging guidance,|258177008
and
then
destroying
the tumor|108369006
with heat|88999006
(radiofrequency ablation|257729003|64597002
or
cold|285686007|82272006|84162001
(cryotherapy.|427357007|26782000

These modalities
are
at a disadvantage
compared
to traditional surgery|263901007|83578000
in that pathologic confirmation|29458008|74996004
of complete tumor destruction|255594003|413200004
is
not possible.|371930009|60022001

Therefore,
long-term follow-up|308273005
is
crucial to
assess
completeness|272143008
of tumour ablation.[45][46]|108369006|257729003|108369006|64597002

RCC "|41607009
elicits|263516000
an immune response,|35024006
which occasionally
results|394617004
in dramatic spontaneous remissions."|5054005|277022003
This
has
encouraged
a strategy
of
using|260676000
immunomodulating therapies,|276239002
such as cancer vaccines|363346000|398827000|372087000|398827000
and
interleukin-2 (IL-2),|428693003
to
reproduce
this response.

IL-2|428693003
has
produced

with substantial toxicity.

Another strategy
is
to
restore
the function|246464006

Sunitinib|421192001
appears
to
offer|410527000
greater potency|263768009|30207005
against advanced RCC,|86005002|41607009
perhaps
because
it
inhibits|61511001

approved|9571008
for the treatment|276239002|416118004
of metastatic renal cell carcinoma.|77879006|41607009

The three to five years|421291004|421820001|258707000
up to 2009 saw dramatic improvements|281004000
in treatment|52101004|276239002|52101004|416118004|18720000|276239002|18720000|416118004

However,
despite

Adjuvent therapy|276239002
is
typically
a secondary treatment|2603003|276239002|2603003|416118004|81170007|276239002|81170007|416118004

re-appearing.|228877007

The re-appearance|228877007|386548000|228877007|255412001
of cancer typically|363346000|372087000

the effectiveness|255403003

The use|277889008|419385000
of non-specific cytokines|10003008|75777003
has
so far|223528007|46053002
been
shown
to
be
ineffective.

Unlike most other cancers,|74964007|363346000
renal cell carcinoma|41607009
is
resistant|30714006
to most cytotoxic
and
cytostatic agents,|327388007
which severely|24484000
limits|255469002
possible effective adjuvant therapy.|371930009|255403003|427067006|276239002|371930009|254648000|427067006|276239002|60022001|255403003|427067006|276239002|60022001|254648000|427067006|276239002
