*Hemiballismus|66637005
*
*
is
a very rare movement disorder,|260358002|84638005|60342002|260358002|103356009|60342002
classified|73504009
by a decrease|260400001|260370003
in activity|48761009|55561003|258745004|257733005
of the subthalamic nucleus
of the basal ganglia,|32610002
resulting|42752001
in decreased suppression|1250004|80633008|1250004|258761002|260400001|80633008|260400001|258761002|260371004|80633008|260371004|258761002
of undesired movements.|255324009

[1]|260305007
It
is
500 times|410669006|417929005
more rare|242762006|84638005|242762006|103356009
than Parkinson's disease.|49049000

Its effects|253861007
can
sometimes
be
severe enough to|24484000
prevent
patients|116154003
from
being
able to|371150009
perform|398166005
daily functions.|69620002|246464006

It
is
usually
associated|47429007
with structural brain lesions|301766008
but
can
occur|272120004
with metabolic abnormalities.|276654001

The symptoms
can
also
decrease|260400001|260370003
while
the patient|116154003
is
asleep,|248220008
unlike some movement disorders.[4]|60342002

Hemiballismus|66637005
is
usually
characterized
by involuntary flinging motions|56219004|272149007
of the extremities.|66019005|2592007

The movements|255324009
are
often violent|70232002
and
have
wide amplitudes|90522003
of motion.|56219004

They
are
continuous|255238004
and
random|255226008
and
can
involve|248448006
proximal|40415009
and/or
distal muscles|46053002|91727004
on one side|66459002
of the body.|279495008|123037004

Some cases even|398241000|413769002
include|55919000
the facial muscles.|25903009

It
is
common|72906007
for arms|40983000
and
legs to|30021000
move|302000008|384598002|370125004
together.

The more|242762006
a patient|116154003
is
active,|55561003
the more|242762006
the movements|255324009
increase.|260366006

With relaxation
comes
a decrease|260400001|260370003
in movements.|255324009

Physicians|309343006
can
measure|246445000|272391002
the severity|272141005
of the disorder|64572001
by
having
the patient|116154003
perform|398166005
a series|13039001
of basic, predetermined tasks|418836005
and
counting|258734002
the hemiballistic movements|255324009
during a set time session.|410669006

The physicians then rate|309343006
the patient|116154003
on a severity scale.|272141005|19892000|272141005|278111002

This scale|19892000|278111002
gives|419582001
scientists|308027003
and
clinicians
a way to
compare
patients|116154003
and
determine
the range
of the disorder.|64572001

The name 'hemiballismus' literally means 'half|66637005|255586005
ballistic',|260987005
referring|439980006
to the violent, flailing movements|811004|255324009
observed
on one side|66459002
of the body.|279495008|123037004

The work|261041009
of J.R.|24028007

Whittier,
F.|372639009
A.

Mettler,
and
M.B.|258311008

Carpenter|24413000
in the mid 1900s|255562008
helped
scientists|308027003
and
clinicians
form|246176004
a more|242762006
complete|255594003
picture|257444003|257445002
of hemiballismus.|66637005

In their experiments,
several lesions|261028005
were
made
in the basal ganglia|32610002
structures
in monkeys|54121002
and
then
they
monitored|302805002|13288007
the results.|394617004

They
noticed
that
the majority
of the time,|410669006
the monkeys|54121002
did
not
have
any unusual movements.|255324009

However,
when
at least twenty percent|276139006|118582008|263796003|118582008
of the subthalamic nucleus
was
damaged|37782003
,
abnormal movements|9748009|225606002
were
seen
in the limbs opposite|66019005
to the side|182353008
of the brain|12738006|258335003
that
was
damaged.|37782003

This observation caused scientists to|103705002|23981006|308027003|103705002|134198009|308027003
believe
that hemiballismus|66637005
outside the subthalamic nucleus
did
not
occur.|272120004

It
was
not
until
much later|242762006|260383002|4757001|260383002
that
this classical model|255333006|260997001
began|255395001
to
expand|70955005
to
include|55919000
other areas|74964007|42798000
of the basal ganglia|32610002
and
even
some cortical structures.|68594002|40146001|50403003

They also
noticed
that
unlike human patients,|278412004|116154003
the unusual movements|255324009
in the monkeys|54121002
were
mainly
in the lower extremities.|61685007

In about half
of the monkeys,|54121002
the hemiballismus|66637005
continued|255238004
until the monkey|54121002
died.[6]|419620001|419099009

Other scientists|74964007|308027003
have
also
worked|261041009
on this perplexing disorder|64572001
and
have
found|404684003
that
the symptoms
can
be
induced|16404004
by injecting kainic acid|422145002|34957004
or
ibotenic acid|303346008
into the subthalamic nucleus.

I.|42146005|22971001

Hamada
and
M.R.|258311008|24028007

DeLong
found|404684003
that
by
using|260676000
these chemicals,|441900009
they
could
destroy only four percent|421534005|118582008
of the subthalamic nucleus
and
still
see|281004000
hemiballistic movements.|255324009

However,
the abnormal movements|9748009|225606002
would
usually
disappear
within four to five hours even|421534005|421820001|258702006
though
it
did
not
appear
as though
the damaged tissue|37782003
had
healed.|90910008

This
suggests
that
the subthalamic nucleus
is
plastic enough to|61088005
adapt
to small amounts|255507004|107651007
of damage|37782003
in order
to
resume
normal function.[6]|17621005|246464006|258744000|246464006

In examining|64049009
the causes|134198009
of hemiballismus,|66637005
it
is
important to
remember
that
this disorder|64572001
is
extremely rare.|84638005|103356009

While
hemiballismus|66637005
can
result|394617004
from the following list,|255260001
just
because
a patient suffers|116154003
from one|421379005
of these disorders|64572001
does
not mean|255586005
they
will
also

When
treating hemiballismus,|28995006|66637005
it
is
first important to|255216001|232714002
treat|395077000
whatever
may
be
causing|23981006
the manifestation|250255003|251190009
of this disorder.|64572001

This
could
be
hyperglycemia,|80394007
infections,
or
neoplastic lesions.|108369006

Some patients|116154003
may
not even
need|410525008|103325001
treatment|276239002|416118004
because
the disorder|64572001
is

can
be

In the past,|410513005
the prognosis|20481000
for patients|116154003
with this disease|64572001
had
been
very poor|260358002|11403006|260358002|255351007
;
with many patients|116154003
suffering
from severe disability|24484000|21134002
or
death.|419620001|268923008

Now,
patients|116154003
are
responding
remarkably well|20572008
to current treatments|15240007|276239002
and
the majority
of patients|116154003
go
into spontaneous remission.|5054005|277022003

For those
that
do
not
go
into remission,|277022003
the symptoms
of hemiballismus|66637005
can
generally
be
very well controlled|260358002|20572008|31509003
with medication.[6]|410942007

Due to the rarity|84638005|103356009
of this disorder,|64572001
scientists|308027003
know|36692007
very little|260358002|281411007|260358002|255507004
about the details
of hemiballismus.|66637005

There
are
still many unanswered questions|42425007
such as
:

?There
appears
to
be
a discrepancy|110287002
between this disorder|64572001
in humans|278412004
and
animals|387961004
that
has
yet to
be
explained.[6]

?Hemiballismus|66637005
can
also
be
induced|16404004
by damage|37782003
to other areas|74964007|42798000
of the basal ganglia|32610002
besides the subthalamic nucleus.

Why
is
this?
Research
is
being
done
in these areas|42798000
in order to
give|419582001
scientists|308027003
and
clinicians
a better model|3442003
for this disease|64572001
that
will
ultimately
lead|88488004
to better diagnosis|3442003|439401001|3442003
and
treatment|276239002|416118004
of this disorder.[6]|64572001

?Research
is
also
being
done
on
why certain treatments|17162000|276239002
seem
to
help
hemiballistic patients|116154003
when
they
should
seemingly
do
more harm.|242762006

An example
of this
is
why lesioning
the globus pallidus|14738005
seems
to
reduce|260400001
hemiballistic movements.[6]|255324009

?
Why
does
blocking dopamine|2899008|412383006|2899008|32779004|112232007|412383006|112232007|32779004
help
reduce|260400001
patients?|116154003
symptoms[6]?

Hemiballismus|66637005
is
a rare movement disorder|84638005|60342002|103356009|60342002
that
is
caused primarily|23981006|134198009
by damage|37782003
to various areas|256220008|42798000
in the basal ganglia.|32610002

While
a classical model|255333006|260997001
for this disorder|64572001
was
developed
in the 1950s,
new discoveries|7147002
are
causing|23981006
that model to
shift.|9546005

New treatments|7147002|276239002
are
also emerging,
allowing
for better control|3442003|31509003
of symptoms
as well as
affecting|247591002|248448006
those who
did
not
respond
to standard treatment.|276239002|416118004

The prognosis|20481000
for patients|116154003
with this disorder|64572001
is
very good,|260358002|20572008
as
research
in the area|42798000
is
continuing|255238004
to
reveal|263857004
new insights|7147002|27026000
into the pathophysiology.|386585008

However,
there
are
still many unanswered questions|42425007
about this unusual movement disorder|60342002
and
scientists|308027003
and
clinicians
are
still
learning|69998004
new information|7147002
as
they
