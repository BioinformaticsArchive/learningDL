*
*
("inflammation|257552002
of the gum tissue"|113279002|85756007
)
is
a non-destructive periodontal disease.|255303004|2556008

The most common form|4757001|72906007|246176004
of gingivitis,|66383009
and
the most common form|4757001|72906007|246176004
of periodontal disease overall,|2556008
is
in response
to bacterial biofilms|409822003
(also called plaque|4522001|1522000|38551001
adherent
to tooth surfaces,|245643006
termed
_plaque-induced gingivitis_.|4522001|16404004|66383009|1522000|16404004|66383009|38551001|16404004|66383009

In the absence|2667000|418560003
of treatment,|276239002|416118004
gingivitis|66383009
may
progress|385651009
to periodontitis,|41565005
which
is
a destructive form|255303004|246176004
of periodontal disease.[2]|2556008

While
in some sites|10546003
or
individuals gingivitis never|125676002|66383009|385435006|66383009
progresses|385651009
to periodontitis,|41565005
[3] data|260313008
indicates|410535002
that periodontitis|41565005
is
always
preceded|236874000
by gingivitis.[4]|66383009

As
defined
by the 1999 World Workshop|224698001
in Clinical Periodontics,|58147004|408461007
there
are
two primary categories|420797005|63161005|420797005|261424001
of gingival diseases,|18718003
each
with numerous subgroups|260396001
:
[5]|264706000|264605009

The symptoms
of gingivitis|66383009
are
somewhat non-specific|10003008
and
manifest|250255003
in the gum tissue|113279002|85756007
as the classic signs|255301002|72670004|255333006|72670004
of inflammation|257552002
:

Additionally,
the stippling
that normally
exists
on the gum tissue|113279002|85756007
of some individuals|125676002|385435006
will
often|70232002
disappear
and
the gums|113279002
may
appear
shiny
when
the gum tissue|113279002|85756007
becomes
swollen|442672001
and
stretched|386781001|122546009
over the inflamed underlying connective tissue.|181769001

The accumulation
may
also
emit|113067009
an unpleasant odor.|103371008

When
the gingiva|113279002|181224006
are
swollen,|442672001
the epithelial lining|50009006
of the gingival crevice|110597005|245753001
becomes
ulcerated|429040005
and
the gums|113279002
will
bleed|131148009
more easily|242762006|36203004
with even gentle brushing,|263693004
and
especially
when
flossing.

The _etiology_,|134198009
or
cause,|134198009
of plaque-induced gingivitis|4522001|16404004|66383009|1522000|16404004|66383009|38551001|16404004|66383009
is
bacterial plaque,|409822003|4522001|409822003|1522000|409822003|38551001
which
acts
to
initiate
the body's host response.|279495008|35024006|123037004|35024006

This,
in turn,|282987006
can
lead|88488004
to destruction|64597002
of the gingival tissues,|113279002|85756007|372457001|85756007
which
may
progress|385651009
to destruction|64597002
of the periodontal attachment apparatus.|245775004|1431002|8711009|1431002

The plaque|4522001|1522000|38551001
accumulates
in the small gaps|255507004
between teeth,|38199008
in the gingival grooves|110597005
and
in areas|42798000
known|36692007
as
_plaque traps_|4522001|403833009|1522000|403833009|38551001|403833009
:
locations|246267002
that
serve
to
accumulate
and
maintain|385630006
plaque.|4522001|1522000|38551001

Examples
of plaque traps|4522001|403833009|1522000|403833009|38551001|403833009
include|55919000
bulky
and
overhanging restorative margins,|112233002|82868003|372249001
claps|15628003
of removable partial dentures|272256008|255609007|272256008
and
calculus|384600008
(tartar|17552000
)
that
forms|246176004
on teeth.|38199008

Although
these accumulations
may
be
tiny,
the bacteria|409822003
in them
produce
chemicals,|441900009
such as degrative enzymes,|90668006
and
toxins,|80917008
such as lipopolysaccharide|3325005
(LPS,|3325005|79261008
otherwise
known|36692007
as endotoxin|18127008
or
lipoteichoic acid (LTA),|34957004
that
promote
an inflammatory response
in the gum tissue.|113279002|85756007

This inflammation|257552002
can
cause|23981006|134198009
an enlargement|56246009|118452000|442021009
of the gingiva|113279002|181224006
and
subsequent formation.|255260001|11798007|255260001|255277001

A dental hygienist|26042002
or
dentist|106289002|82603007
will
check|360160009
for the symptoms
of gingivitis,|66383009
and
may
also
examine|64049009
the amount|107651007
of plaque|4522001|1522000|38551001
in the oral cavity.|74262004|181220002

A dental hygienist|26042002
or
dentist|106289002|82603007
will
also
look|386548000
for signs|72670004
of periodontitis|41565005
using|260676000
X-rays|52250000|168537006
or
periodontal probing|245775004|387651008|8711009|387651008
as well as
other methods.|272394005

If gingivitis|66383009
is
not responsive|422768004
to treatment,|276239002|416118004
referral|3457005
to a periodontist|37154003
(
a specialist|309395003
in diseases|64572001
of the gingiva|113279002|181224006
and
bone|272673000|3138006|90780006|128530007
around teeth|38199008
and
dental implants|84610002
)
for further treatment|46053002|276239002|46053002|416118004
may
be
necessary.

Gingivitis|66383009
can
be
prevented|116699007
through regular oral hygiene|17854005|364126007
that
includes|55919000
daily brushing|69620002|263693004
and
flossing.

Hydrogen peroxide,|387171003
saline,|373757009
alcohol|419442005|53041004|430837008
or
chlorhexidine mouth washes|373568007|70409003
may
also
be
employed.|224363007

In a recent clinical study,|6493001|58147004|110465008|6493001|58147004|224699009
the beneficial effect|253861007
of hydrogen peroxide|387171003
on gingivitis|66383009
has
been
highlighted.

Rigorous plaque control|16046003|4522001|31509003|16046003|1522000|31509003|16046003|38551001|31509003|248457000|4522001|31509003|248457000|1522000|31509003|248457000|38551001|31509003
programs
along
with periodontal scaling|245775004|271767006|8711009|271767006
and
curettage also|129319001
have
proved|277025001
to
be
helpful,
although
according to the American Dental Association,|263534001|272151006
periodontal scaling|245775004|271767006|8711009|271767006
and
root planing|234699004
are
considered
as a treatment|276239002|416118004
to periodontal disease,|2556008
not
as a preventive treatment|169443000
for periodontal disease.|2556008

In a 1997 review
of effectiveness data|255403003
the U.S.|223688001

Food and Drug Administration (FDA)|255620007|18629005
found|404684003
clear evidence|263707001|18669006
which
showed
that toothpaste containing triclosan|48741003|42504009|387054001
was
effective|255403003|254648000
in preventing gingivitis.[10]|66383009|116699007|66383009

In many countries,|223369002
such as the United States,|223688001
mouthwashes|70409003
containing|42504009
chlorhexidine|373568007
are
available only|103328004
by prescription.|260885003

Researchers
analyzed
government data
on calcium consumption|5540006
and
periodontal disease indicators|2556008
in nearly 13,000 U.S.|223688001

adults.|133936004

They
found|404684003
that men|339947000
and
women|224526002
who
had
calcium intakes|230122008
of fewer|57176003
than 500 milligrams,|258684004
or
about half
the recommended dietary allowance,|41829006
were
almost twice|421832002
as
likely to|2931005
have
gum disease,|18718003|2556008
as
measured|258104002
by the loss
of attachment|1431002
of the gums|113279002
from the teeth.|38199008

The association|263534001|272151006
was
particularly evident|18669006
for people|125676002
in their 20s
and
30s.[11]

Preventing gum disease|18718003|2556008|116699007|18718003|116699007|2556008
may
also
benefit
a healthy heart.|263775005|80891009|263775005|302509004

According to physicians|309343006
with The Institute|385437003
for Good Medicine|20572008|410942007
at the Pennsylvania Medical Society,|421638001|74188005
good oral health|405153007|260548002
can
reduce|260400001
risk|30207005
of cardiac events.|80891009|272379006

Poor oral health|11403006|260548002|263775005|255351007|260548002|263775005
can
lead|88488004
to infections
that
can
travel|420008001
within the bloodstream.[12]

The focus|87017008|363702006
of treatment|276239002|416118004
for gingivitis|66383009
is
removal|118292001|128303001
of the etiologic|134198009
(causative
)
agent,|260872001
plaque.|4522001|1522000|38551001

Therapy|276239002
is
aimed
at the reduction|58294000|260400001|289928003
of oral bacteria,|260548002|409822003
and
may
take|419652001
the form|246176004
of regular periodic visits|302757007
to a dental professional
together with adequate oral hygiene home care.|51117008|364126007|60689008|88323005|364126007|60689008

Thus,
several|261028005
of the methods|260686004|272394005
used|394850002
in the prevention|169443000
of gingivitis|66383009
can
also
be
used|394850002
for the treatment|276239002|416118004
of manifest gingivitis,|250255003|66383009
such as scaling,|271767006
root planing,|234699004
curettage,|129319001
mouth washes|70409003
containing|42504009
chlorhexidine|373568007
or
hydrogen peroxide,|387171003
and
flossing.

Interdental brushes also|260240005|994005
help
remove|127485006
any causative agents.[13]|362944004

Recent scientific studies|6493001|110465008|6493001|224699009
have
also
shown
the beneficial effects|253861007
of mouthwashes|70409003
with essential oils.[14]|35079003

Furthermore,
oral Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drug (NSAID) rinses|70409003|372665008
are
a relatively new treatment modality|7147002|276239002|7147002|416118004
for treating inflammation|28995006|257552002
in the oral cavity.|74262004|181220002

NSAIDs|372665008
such as ibuprofen|387207008
or
diclofenac,|7034005
are
a mainstay
of analgesic|373265006
and
anti-inflammatory treatment|330901000|276239002|330901000|416118004
in dentistry.

However,
the systemic use|31099001|277889008|31099001|419385000
of NSAID's|372665008
are
associated|47429007
with several side-effects,|261028005
namely cardiovascular thrombotic events,|405617006|396339007
such as myocardial infarction|22298006
and
stroke,|230690007
gastric irritability|69695003|55929007|264010009|55929007
or
ulcerogenic effects,|429040005|253861007
blood dyscrasias,|34093004
and
nephrotoxicity
;
among these gastric irritability|69695003|55929007|264010009|55929007
is
most common.|4757001|72906007

Therefore,
it
is
preferable to
use|277889008|419385000
local formulations|255470001
such as a mouthwash to|70409003
treat|395077000
oral inflammatory conditions e.g.|260548002|260905004|258795003

gingivitis.|66383009

A randomized, investigator-blind,
clinical study|58147004|110465008|58147004|224699009
published
in September,
2011,
showed
the new Diclofenac Epolamine|7147002|425650004
(diclofenac N-(2-hydroxyethyl|7034005
)
Pyrrolidine|259274001
; DHEP|425650004
)
,
a diclofenac salt|7034005|387390002
with greater water solubility,|263768009|11713004|263768009|119318008
as
an effective|255403003|254648000
and
tolerable medicinal product|410942007
for symptomatic|264931009
and
post-surgical relief|288563008|83578000|224978009
of inflammation|257552002
of the oral cavity.|74262004|181220002

Volunteers|160772005
with inflammatory conditions,|260905004
of which gingivitis|66383009
was
most prevalent,|4757001
treated|28995006
with DHEP,|425650004
experienced
a significantly greater reduction|263768009|58294000|263768009|260400001|263768009|289928003
in pain|22253000
and
inflammation|257552002
and
were
also free|37837009
of pain|22253000
and
inflammatory symptoms
as soon
as Day 3|258703001|259032004
of the study|110465008|224699009
compared
to those
treated|28995006
with merely 0.0075% diclofenac mouthwash.|7034005|70409003

There
was
an even greater reduction|263768009|58294000|263768009|260400001|263768009|289928003
relative|125677006|29920004
to the placebo group.[16]|261586004|160481000|389109008

Moreover,
studies|110465008|224699009
published
in the Journal
of Periodontology|408461007
comparing
the NSAID?s,|372665008
Celcoxib
or
Etorcoxib
and
the corticosteroid,|79440004
dexamethasone also|372584003
showed
the power|33300005
and
efficacy
of
using|260676000
proper NSAID therapy to|372665008|276239002
combat
oral inflammation.|260548002|257552002

The results|394617004
of these studies|110465008|224699009
showed
the use|277889008|419385000
of celecoxib|116081000
or
dexamethasone|372584003
as effective|255403003|254648000
for the prevention|169443000
and
preemptive control|31509003
of postoperative pain|213299007
after periodontal surgery.[13]|234677007
