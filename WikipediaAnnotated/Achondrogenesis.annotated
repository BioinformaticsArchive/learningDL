*Achondrogenesis|2391001
*
*
is
a number|410680006|410681005
of disorders|64572001
that
are
the most severe form|4757001|24484000|246176004
of congenital chondrodysplasia|268274005
(malformation|276654001
of bones|272673000|128530007
and
cartilage.|61496007

These conditions|260905004
are
characterized
by a small body,|255507004|279495008|255507004|123037004
short limbs,|359530003|66019005|367450005|66019005
and
other skeletal abnormalities.|74964007|113192009|276654001

As a result|394617004
of their serious health problems,|42745003|263775005|55607006
infants|418119000
with achondrogenesis|2391001
are
usually
born|106970005|81827009|398209006
prematurely,
are
stillborn
,
or
die|419620001|399069006|419099009
shortly after birth|3950001
from respiratory failure.|409622000

Some infants,|418119000
however,
have
lived|224130005|419749002
for a
while
with intensive medical support.|74188005|9096001|74188005|243114000

Researchers
have
described
at least three forms|276139006|421291004|246176004|263796003|421291004|246176004
of achondrogenesis,|2391001
designated
as Achondrogenesis type 1A,|42725006
achondrogenesis type 1B|14870002
and
achondrogenesis type 2.|254061001

These types|261664005
are
distinguished
by their signs|72670004
and
symptoms,
inheritance pattern,|246071007|272135003
and
genetic cause.|3950001|134198009|255395001|134198009

Other types|74964007|261664005
of achondrogenesis|2391001
may
exist
,
but
they
have
not
been
characterized
or
their cause|134198009
is
unknown.|261665006

Achondrogenesis type 1A|42725006
is
caused|23981006|134198009
by a defect|6920004
in the microtubules|34783000
of the Golgi apparatus.|65251009

In mice,|447612001|447482001
a nonsense mutation|327671006
in the thyroid hormone receptor interactor 11 gene|32103009|67271001
(Trip11
)
,
which
encodes
the Golgi microtubule-associated protein 210 (GMAP-210),|65251009|34783000|47429007|88878007
resulted|42752001|394617004
in defects|6920004
similar
to the human disease.|278412004|64572001

When
their DNA|24851008
was
sequenced|72633008
,
human patients|278412004|116154003
with achondrogenesis type 1A also|42725006
had
loss-
of-function mutations|246464006|55446002
in GMAP-210.

GMAP-210
moves|302000008
proteins|88878007
from the endoplasmic reticulum|33761008
to the Golgi apparatus.|65251009

Because of the defect,|6920004
GMAP-210
is
not able to|371150009
move|302000008|384598002|370125004
the proteins,|88878007
and
they
remain
in the endoplasmic reticulum,|33761008
which swells|423666004
up.

The loss
of Golgi apparatus function|65251009|246464006
affects|4065008
some cells,|4421005
such as those responsible|394851003
for forming bone|35810008|272673000|35810008|3138006|35810008|90780006|35810008|128530007
and
cartilage,|61496007
more
than others.[1]|74964007

Achondrogenesis type 1B|14870002
is
caused|23981006|134198009
by a similar mutation|55446002
in SLC26A2,
which
encodes
a sulfate transporter.|95975008
