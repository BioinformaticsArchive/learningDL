*Shigellosis|36188001
*
*,
also
known|36692007
as
*
*bacillary dysentery|36188001|274081004
*
*
or
*
*Marlow Syndrome
*
*,
in its most severe manifestation,|4757001|24484000|250255003|4757001|24484000|251190009
is
a foodborne illness|39104002
caused|23981006|134198009
by infection
by bacteria|409822003
of the genus _Shigella_.|77352002

Shigellosis rarely|36188001|103356009
occurs|272120004
in animals|387961004
other than humans|278412004
and
other primates|74964007|388073004
like monkeys|54121002
and
chimpanzees.[1]|1480007

The causative organism|410653004
is
frequently|70232002
found|404684003
in water|11713004|119318008
polluted
with human feces,|278412004|39477002
and
is
transmitted|60117003|258150004
via the fecal-oral route.|39477002|26643006

The usual mode
of transmission|258150004
is
directly person-to-person|125676002
hand-to-mouth,|85562004|74262004|85562004|123851003|85562004|21082005|85562004|181220002|302539009|74262004|302539009|123851003|302539009|21082005|302539009|181220002
in the setting
of poor hygiene|11403006|284779002|255351007|284779002
among children.[2]|410601007|160499008

Symptoms
may
range
from mild abdominal discomfort|255604002|43364001
to full-blown dysentery|261015003|387085005|111939009|261015003|111939009
characterized
by cramps,|55300003
diarrhea,|398032003
fever,|386661006
vomiting|249497008
,
blood,|87612001|119273009
pus,|11311000|119323008
or
mucus|49909006
in stools|39477002
or
tenesmus.|267053000

Onset time|263501003
is
12
to 96 hours,|258702006
and
recovery
takes|419652001
5
to 7 days.[4]|258703001

Infections
are
associated|47429007
with mucosal ulceration,|95356008
rectal bleeding,|12063002
and
drastic dehydration.|34095006

Reiter's disease|67224007
and
hemolytic uremic syndrome|111407006
are
possible sequelae|371930009|302049001|60022001|302049001
that
have
been
reported|229059009|223458004
in the aftermath
of shigellosis.|36188001

_Shigella_|36188001|77352002
can
be
transmitted|60117003|258150004
through food,|255620007
including|55919000
salads|227927005
(potato,|260170007|1590002
tuna,|260175002|227144008
shrimp,|278840001
macaroni,|226742005
and
chicken|409910000|226955001
)
,
raw vegetables,|314115004
milk|3718001|119321005|70813002
and
dairy products,|226760005
and
meat.|28647000

Contamination
of these foods|255620007
is
usually
through the fecal-oral route.|39477002|26643006

Fecally contaminated water|102414000
and
unsanitary handling
by food handlers|255620007
are
the most common causes|4757001|72906007|134198009
of contamination.

Apart from hand-to-mouth infection,|85562004|275393007|302539009|275393007
Shigellosis|36188001
is
transmitted|60117003|258150004
through fomites,
water|11713004|119318008
and
mechanical vectors|261018001|260529001
like houseflies.|22342008

The most common neurological symptom|4757001|72906007|267070008
includes|55919000
seizures.[5]|91175000

Insufficient data|71978007|423437008
exists
,
[6]
but
conservative estimates|414135002
suggest
that _Shigella_ causes approximately 90 million cases|36188001|134198009|26175008|264705001|398241000|36188001|134198009|26175008|264705001|413769002|36188001|134198009|26175008|264703008|398241000|36188001|134198009|26175008|264703008|413769002|77352002|134198009|26175008|264705001|398241000|77352002|134198009|26175008|264705001|413769002|77352002|134198009|26175008|264703008|398241000|77352002|134198009|26175008|264703008|413769002
of severe dysentery annually,|24484000|111939009|53281000
with
at least 100,000|276139006|263796003
of these resulting|42752001
in death,|419620001|268923008
mostly
among children|410601007|160499008
in the developing world.

_Shigella_ also|36188001|77352002
causes|134198009
approximately 580,000 cases annually|26175008|398241000|53281000|26175008|413769002|53281000
among travelers
and
military personnel|302314004
from industrialized countries.[5]|223369002

An estimated 18,000 cases|414135002|398241000|414135002|413769002
of shigellosis|36188001
occur|272120004
annually|53281000
in the United States.|223688001

Infants,|418119000
the elderly,|105436006
and
the infirm
are
susceptible|131196009
to the severest symptoms|162470006
of disease,|64572001
but
all humans|278412004
are
susceptible|131196009
to some degree.|258395000|246173007

Individuals|125676002|385435006
with acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS)|62479008
are
more frequently|242762006|70232002
infected
with _Shigella_.|36188001|77352002

Shigellosis|36188001
is
a more common|242762006|72906007
and
serious condition|42745003|260905004
in the developing world
;
fatality rates|399166001
of Shigellosis epidemics|36188001
in developing countries|223369002
can
be
5?15%.[8]|264706000|264605009

Simple precautions|13673007
can
be
taken|419652001
to
prevent
getting shigellosis|36188001
:
wash
hands|85562004
before handling food|255620007
and
thoroughly
cook|106373003
all food|255620007
before eating.|48263008

Currently,|15240007
no licenced vaccine targeting _Shigella_|398827000|36188001|398827000|77352002
exists.

_Shigella_|36188001|77352002
has
been
a longstanding World Health Organization target|263775005|21139007
for vaccine development,|398827000|278923009
and
sharp|410707003
declines
in age-specific diarrhea/dysentery attack rates|424144002|69658003|398032003|111939009|217315002|424144002|69658003|398032003|111939009|216299002
for this pathogen|264418008
indicate|410535002
that natural immunity|510009|58915005
does
develop
following|255260001
exposure|71677004|24932003
;
thus,
vaccination to
prevent
the disease|64572001
should
be
feasible.

Several vaccine candidates|261028005|398827000
for _Shigella_|36188001|77352002
are
in various stages|256220008|261612004
of development.|278923009

Candidates
in development|278923009
include|55919000
live attenuated, conjugate,|419749002|24588000|76698003
ribosomal,|26761006
and
proteosome vaccines.|130755008|398827000

There
are
promising results|394617004
for a vaccine|398827000
against serotype 1,|276770009
which otherwise
show
large resistance|255509001|30714006
to antibiotics.[10]|255631004

Treatment|276239002|416118004
consists
mainly
of replacing fluids|370124000|32457005|370124000|33463005
and
salts|387390002
lost
because of diarrhea.|398032003

Oral replacement|260548002|3137001|260548002|282089006
is
satisfactory
for most people,|125676002
but
some
may
need|410525008|103325001
to
receive
fluids intravenously.|32457005|33463005

In most cases,|398241000|413769002
the disease|64572001
resolves
within four|421534005
to eight days|421825006|258703001
without antibiotics.|255631004

Severe infections|24484000
may
last
three|421291004
to six weeks.|422218008|258705008

Antibiotics,|255631004
such as trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole|398731002
(Co-Trimoxazole|398731002
)
,
norfloxacin,|387271008
ciprofloxacin|392412000
or
furazolidone,|416556006
may
be
given|419582001
when
the person|125676002
is
very young|260358002|84422007
or
very old,|260358002|70753007
when
the disease|64572001
is
severe,|24484000
or
when
there
is
a high risk|15508007
of the infection
spreading|410677005
to other people.|74964007|125676002

Additionally,
ampicillin|387170002
(
but
not amoxicillin|372687004
is
effective|255403003|254648000
in treating|28995006
this disease.[11]|64572001

_Shigella_|36188001|77352002

reduced|260400001
with antibiotics.|255631004

However,
many strains|48532005|276768000
of _Shigella_|36188001|77352002
are
becoming
resistant|30714006
to common antibiotics,|72906007|255631004
and
effective medications|255403003|410942007|254648000|410942007

often|70232002
in short supply|359530003|425398004|367450005|425398004
in developing countries.|223369002

Antidiarrheal drugs|419028009
(
such as diphenoxylate|440585000
or
loperamide|387040009
may
prolong|255224006
