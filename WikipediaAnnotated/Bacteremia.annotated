*Bacteremia|5758002
*
*
(also
*
*bacteraemia|5758002
*
*
or
*
*bacter?mia
*
*
)
is
the presence|386397008
of bacteria|409822003
in the blood.|87612001|119273009

The blood|87612001|119273009
is
normally
a sterile environment,|224781007
so
the detection
of bacteria|409822003
in the blood|87612001|119273009
(most commonly|4757001
accomplished
by blood cultures|30088009
is
always abnormal.|263654008

Bacteria|409822003
can
enter|417985001
the bloodstream
as a severe complication|24484000|116223007|24484000|263718001
of infections
(
like pneumonia|205237003
or
meningitis,|7180009
during surgery|83578000
(especially
when
involving|248448006
mucous membranes|313268005
such as the gastrointestinal tract,|122865005|279972009
or
due to catheters|19923001
and
other foreign bodies|74964007|125670008
entering|417985001
the arteries|51114001|11527006
or
veins|29092000
(
including|55919000
intravenous drug abuse.|26416006|255560000|26416006

Bacteremia|5758002
can
have
several consequences.|261028005|103332005

The immune response|35024006
to the bacteria|409822003
can
cause|23981006|134198009
sepsis|105592009|91302008
and
septic shock,|76571007
which
has
a relatively high mortality rate.|75540009|409651001|371879000|409651001

Bacteria|409822003
can
also
use|277889008|419385000
the blood to|87612001|119273009
spread|410677005
to other parts|74964007|260726005
of the body|279495008|123037004
(
which
is
called hematogenous spread|410677005
)
,
causing|23981006
infections away
from the original site|19535007|10546003
of infection.

Examples
include|55919000
endocarditis|56819008
or
osteomyelitis.|60168000

Treatment|276239002|416118004
is
with antibiotics,|255631004
and
prevention|169443000
with antibiotic prophylaxis|422181004
can
be
given|419582001
in situations
where problems|55607006
are
to
be
expected.

Bacteremia|5758002
is
the presence|386397008
of viable bacteria|263927007|409822003
in the blood stream.|87612001|257709004|119273009|257709004

Bacteremia|5758002
is
different|263735002
from sepsis|105592009|91302008
(so-called blood poisoning|223528007|5758002|223528007|105592009|223528007
or
toxemia|15394000
)
,
which
is
a condition|260905004
where bacteremia|5758002
is
associated|47429007
with an inflammatory response
from the body|279495008|123037004
(
causing|23981006
systemic inflammatory response syndrome,|238150007
characterised
by rapid breathing,|271823003
low blood pressure,|45007003
fever,|386661006
etc.
).

Common oral hygiene,|72906007|364126007
such as brushing teeth|263693004|38199008
or
flossing,
can
cause|23981006|134198009
transient|14803004
but
harmless bacteremia.|5758002

Some patients|116154003
with prosthetic heart valves however|25510005
need|410525008|103325001
antibiotic prophylaxis|422181004
for dental surgery|81733005
because
bacteremia|5758002
might
lead|88488004
to endocarditis|56819008
(infection causing inflammation|23981006|257552002
of the interior lining|50009006
of the heart.|80891009|302509004

Septicemia|105592009
is
an ill-defined non-scientific term|367391008
introducing|127487003
more confusion|242762006|286933003
between sepsis|105592009|91302008
and
bacteremia|5758002
:
it misleadingly
suggests
there
is
something
in the bloodstream causing sepsis.|23981006|105592009|23981006|91302008

Is

In the hospital,|285201006
indwelling catheters|266765001
are
a frequent cause|70232002|134198009
of bacteremia|5758002
and
subsequent nosocomial infections,|255260001|19168005
because
they
provide
a means|255586005
by which bacteria normally|409822003
found|404684003
on the skin|119325001|39937001|181469002
can
enter|417985001
the bloodstream.

Other causes|74964007|134198009
of bacteremia|5758002
include|55919000
dental procedures|108306002
(occasionally
including|55919000
simple tooth brushing|13673007|20235003
)
,
herpes
(
including|55919000
herpetic whitlow,|43891009
urinary tract infections,|68566005
peritonitis,|48661000
_Clostridium difficile_ colitis,|423590009
intravenous drug use,|410942007
and
colorectal cancer.|264267007|363346000|264267007|372087000

Bacteremia|5758002
may
also
be
seen
in oropharyngeal, gastrointestinal|31389004
or
genitourinary surgery|21514008|83578000
or
exploration.|122458006

Salmonella infection,|302231008|90974009
despite
mainly only
resulting|42752001
in gastroenteritis|25374005
in the developed world,
is
a common cause|72906007|134198009
of bacteremia|5758002
in Africa.|223498002

It principally
affects|4065008
children|410601007|160499008
who
lack|41277001
antibodies|68498002
to Salmonella|27268008|302231008
and
HIV+ patients|19030005|116154003|86406008|116154003|402916007|116154003
of all ages.|424144002

Bacteremia,|5758002
as
noted
above,
frequently|70232002
elicits|263516000
a vigorous immune system response.|35024006|246333005

The constellation
of findings|404684003
related|272151006|262094002
to this response
(
such as fever,|386661006
chills,|43724002
or
hypotension|45007003
is
referred to|439980006
as
sepsis.|105592009|91302008

In the setting
of more severe disturbances|242762006|24484000
of temperature,|105723007|246508008
respiration,|258162000
heart rate|364075005
or
white blood cell count,|767002|365630000
the response
is
characterized
as septic shock,|76571007
and
may
result|394617004
in _multiple organ dysfunction syndrome_.|57653000

Bacteremia|5758002
is
the principal means|63161005|255586005|302311007|255586005
by which local infections|255470001
are
spread|410677005
to distant organs|261007001|410653004
(
referred|439980006
to
as
_hematogenous spread_|410677005
).

Bacteremia|5758002
is
typically transient|14803004
rather than
continuous,|255238004
due to a vigorous immune system response|35024006|246333005
when
bacteria|409822003
are
detected|260373001
in the blood.|87612001|119273009

Hematogenous dissemination|65709003
of bacteria|409822003
is
part|260726005
of the pathophysiology|386585008
of meningitis|7180009
and
endocarditis,|56819008
and
of Pott's disease|35984006
and
many other forms|74964007|246176004
of osteomyelitis.|60168000

Bacteremia|5758002
is
most commonly|4757001
diagnosed|439401001
by blood culture,|30088009
in which
a sample|123038009
of blood|87612001|119273009
is
allowed to
incubate
with a medium|255508009
that
promotes
bacterial growth.|88458008

Since
blood|87612001|119273009
is
normally sterile,|261029002|15296000
this process|415178003
does
not normally
lead|88488004
to the isolation|40174006|46651001
of bacteria.|409822003

If,
however,
bacteria|409822003
are
present|52101004|246105001
in the bloodstream
at the time|410669006
the sample|123038009
is
obtained,|398092000
the bacteria|409822003
will
multiply|421206002
and
can
thereby
be
detected.|260373001

Any bacteria|409822003
that incidentally
find
their way
to the culture medium|421955000
will
also multiply.|421206002

For this reason,|410666004
blood cultures|30088009
must
be
drawn
with great attention|255509001|6769007|263768009|6769007
to sterile process.|261029002|415178003|15296000|415178003

Occasionally,
blood cultures|30088009
will
reveal|263857004
the presence|386397008
of bacteria|409822003
that
represent
contamination
from the skin|119325001|39937001|181469002
through which
the culture|252398009|61594008
was
obtained.|398092000

Blood cultures|30088009
must
be
repeated|27582007
at intervals to|385673002
determine
if persistent ?
rather than
transient ? bacteremia|14803004|5758002
is
present.|52101004|246105001
