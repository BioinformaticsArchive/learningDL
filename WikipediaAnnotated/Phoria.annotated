Phoria|22066006|14619009
have
been
seen
alongside Little Dragon
on their 2010 UK tour,|282987006
and
perform|398166005
in the South East
and
across the UK.

Phoria's origins|22066006|255395001|14619009|255395001
can
be
traced|260405006
to
around 1997
when
Trewin Howard
(vocals/guitar
and
Ed Sanderson|397803000|225728007
(keyboard/violin/vocals
started|385652002
learning cello|69998004|302914006
and
violin together
at their primary school|161119008
in Wiltshire,|223908000
a talent
that
would
later
lead|88488004
them to
perform|398166005
in orchestras
across the county.

At the same time,|262126009|410669006
Jeb Hardwick
(guitar/visuals|255374006
was
taking lessons|419652001
in classical guitar,|255333006|260997001
and
when
Trewin
picked
up the guitar
and
Ed|397803000|225728007
began|255395001
to
play|300776002
piano,
the three|421291004
of them
began|255395001
their first creative endeavours together.|255216001|232714002

Regular performances|17854005
and
songwriting sessions
continued|255238004
for several years,|261028005|258707000
but
the young musicians soon|84422007
separated|13184001|263869007
for university.|224871002

Ed|397803000|225728007
continued|255238004
to
study|110465008|224699009
music
for his degree,|258395000|246173007
where
he
studied music theory|110465008|224699009
and
played violin|300776002
and
piano.

Jeb
began|255395001
a sociology degree,|258395000|246173007
spending
much
of his spare time experimenting|410669006
with music software
and
visual arts,|255374006
whilst
continuing|255238004
to
play|300776002
guitar.

Trewin
attended|410542002
the performing arts college|224864007
at Dartington
in Devon,|223874003
where
he
started|385652002
a fine art course|3082000|288524001
before
being
drawn
back
to music.

His lack|41277001
of willingness to|225466006
stick
to the curriculum
meant|255586005
that
he
left|7771000
without a degree,|258395000|246173007
but
armed|40983000|53120007|182245002|302538001
with 200 compositions
and
songs ready to
be
brought|68369002
to life|224130005
by the right band,|24028007|77541009|24028007|255281001
and
an individual voice|125676002|385435006
with the confidence to|225487001
use|277889008|419385000
it.

When
Trewin,
Ed,|397803000|225728007
and
Jeb
were
re|228877007
-
united
in 2009,
they
set
out to|255529000

their band.|77541009|255281001

Jeb
and
Ed|397803000|225728007
had
met|229057006
a guitarist named Tim Douglas|27468005
whilst
at Southampton University,|224871002
who
was
keen|225471004
to
turn|282987006
his talents to
bass
to
complete|255594003
the line-up.|50009006|255532002|50009006|353734004

Phoria's drummer Seryn Burden|22066006|14619009
joined
the band|77541009|255281001

his passion

his major course.|255603008|288524001

He
played|300776002
his debut performance
at the Playgroup Festival|311763006
