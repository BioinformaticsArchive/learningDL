The skin|119325001|39937001|181469002
of most bony|263686003
and
cartilaginous fishes|107298006
is
covered|255334000
by
*
*scales|19892000|13389002
*
*.

Scales|19892000|13389002
vary
enormously
in size,|277049003
shape,|107644003|246176004|300842002
structure,
and
extent,|255590007
ranging
from rigid armour|16046003|261026009
plates|271003|239289001
in fishes|90580008
such as shrimpfishes
and
boxfishes,|107514005
to microscopic|84496004
or
absent|2667000
in fishes|90580008
such as eels|260183008
and
anglerfishes.

The morphology|116676008|72724002
of a scale|19892000|278111002
can
be
used|394850002
to
identify|7882003
the species|69658003
of fish|90580008
it
came
from.

Fish scales|90580008|19892000|90580008|13389002
are
produced
from the mesoderm layer|64927000
of the dermis,|53534000
which
distinguishes
them
from reptile scales.|107241004|19892000|107241004|13389002

The same genes|262126009|67271001
involved|248448006
in tooth|38199008|302214001
and
hair development|386045008|278923009|119326000|278923009
in mammals|387976007
are
also
involved|248448006
in scale development.[1]|19892000|278923009|278111002|278923009

Also
called
*
*dermal denticles|119325001|57602001|39937001|57602001|181469002|57602001
*
*,
placoid scales|19892000|13389002
are
found|404684003
in the cartilaginous fishes|107298006
:
sharks,|71352007
rays,|107315007|82107009
and
chimaeras.|2229005

They
are
structurally homologous
with vertebrate teeth|387967000|38199008
("denticle"|57602001
translates
to "small tooth"|255507004|38199008|255507004|302214001
)
,
having
a central pulp cavity|26216008|72236009
supplied|425398004
with blood vessels,|59820001
surrounded|355648006
by a conical layer|69975007|67621007
of dentine,|84540008
all
of which
sits|282967005
on top|421812003
of a rectangular basal plate|59410002|57195005|271003
that
rests|258157001
on the dermis.|53534000

The outermost layer
is
composed
of vitrodentine,
a largely inorganic enamel-|76993005
like substance.|105590001

Placoid scales|19892000|13389002
cannot
grow
in size,|277049003
but
rather more
scales|19892000|13389002
are
added
as the fish|90580008
increases|260366006
in size.|277049003

Similar scales|19892000|13389002
can
also
be
found|404684003
under the head|69536005|302548004
of the Denticle herring.|57602001|107348007|57602001|230025007|57602001|260182003

Sharks|71352007
are
entirely
covered|255334000
by placoid scales.|19892000|13389002

Studies|110465008|224699009
have
found|404684003
that
the scales|19892000|13389002
create
tiny
vortices|255376008
that
reduce|260400001
drag,|416731003
which
makes
swimming|20461001
more efficient|242762006|260375008
,
as well as
quieter|255357006
compared
to bony fishes.

The amount|107651007
of scale coverage|19892000|278111002
is
much less|242762006|4757001
in rays|107315007|82107009
and
chimaeras.|2229005

The rough, sandpaper-
like texture|246200002
of shark|71352007|227101009
and
ray skin,|107315007|119325001|107315007|39937001|107315007|181469002|82107009|119325001|82107009|39937001|82107009|181469002
coupled
with its toughness,
has
led|88488004|236874000
it to
be
valued
as a source|260753009
of leather.|19627002

Called shagreen,
one|421379005
of its many applications|260396001|410618006
was
in the historical manufacture|392521001
of hand-grips|128965002
for swords.|102328007

Cosmoid scales|19892000|13389002
are
found|404684003
in several ancient lobe-finned fishes,|261028005|10117001|90580008
including|55919000
some
of the earliest lungfishes,|264499004
and
were
probably
derived
from a fusion|31883006|122501008
of placoid scales.|19892000|13389002

They
are
composed
of a layer
of dense, lamellar bone|255596001|272673000|255596001|3138006|255596001|90780006|255596001|128530007
called
isopedine,
above which
is
a layer
of spongy bone|20870005
supplied|425398004
with blood vessels.|59820001

The bone layers|272673000|3138006|90780006|128530007
are
covered|255334000
by a complex dentine layer called cosmine|103360007|84540008
and
a superficial outer coating|26283006|261074009
of vitrodentine.

Cosmoid scales|19892000|13389002
increase|260366006
in size|277049003
through the growth
of the lamellar bone layer.|272673000|3138006|90780006|128530007

Ganoid scales|19892000|13389002
are
found|404684003
in the sturgeons,|20264007
paddlefishes,|62089004
gars,|53426009
bowfin,|2768002
and
bichirs.

They
are
derived
from cosmoid scales,|19892000|13389002
with a layer
of dentine|84540008
in the place|257557008|421066005
of cosmine,
and
a layer
of inorganic bone salt|272673000|387390002|3138006|387390002|90780006|387390002|128530007|387390002
called
ganoine
in place|257557008|421066005
of vitrodentine.

Most
are
diamond-shaped|1726000|107644003|1726000|300842002
and
connected
by peg-and-socket joints.|335901003|50870008

In sturgeons,|20264007
the scales|19892000|13389002
are
greatly
enlarged|260376009|118452000
into armor plates|271003
along the sides|182353008
and
back,
while
in the bowfin|2768002
the scales|19892000|13389002
are
greatly
reduced|260400001
in thickness to|246703001
resemble
cycloid scales|19892000|13389002
(
see|281004000
below
).

Elasmoid scales|19892000|13389002
are
thin, imbricated scales|18043004|19892000|18043004|13389002
composed
of a layer
of dense, lamellar bone|255596001|272673000|255596001|3138006|255596001|90780006|255596001|128530007
called
isopedine,
above which
is
a layer
of tubercles usually|69824008
composed
of bone,|272673000|3138006|90780006|128530007
as
in _Eusthenopteron_.

The layer
of dentine|84540008
that
was
present|52101004|246105001
in the first sarcopterygians|255216001|232714002
is
usually
reduced|260400001
,
as
in the extant coelacanth,
or
entirely absent,|2667000
as
in extant lungfish
and
in the Devonian _Eusthenopteron_.

Elasmoid scales|19892000|13389002
appeared
several times.|261028005|410669006|261028005|417929005

They
are
present|52101004|246105001
in some lobe-finned fishes|10117001|90580008
:
coelacanths,
all extant
and
some extinct lungfishes,
some tetrapodomorphs
like _Eusthenopteron_,
amiids,
and
teleosts,
whose cycloid
and
ctenoid scales|19892000|13389002
represent
the least mineralized elasmoid scales.|276139006|19892000|276139006|13389002|263796003|19892000|263796003|13389002

Cycloid
and
ctenoid scales|19892000|13389002
are
found|404684003
in the teleosts,
the more derived clade|242762006
of ray-finned fishes.|107315007|10117001

*
*Cycloid
*
* scales|19892000|13389002
have
smooth margins,|82280004|112233002|82280004|82868003|82280004|372249001
while
*
*ctenoid
*
* scales|19892000|13389002
have
tiny teeth|38199008
called
*
*ctenii
*
*
on the posterior edge|255551008|57183005
that
give|419582001
them a rough texture.|246200002

These scales|19892000|13389002
contain|42504009
almost no bone,|272673000|3138006|90780006|128530007
being
composed
of a surface layer containing hydroxyapatite|410678000|42504009|425874004
and
calcium carbonate,|387307005
and
a deeper layer|131197000
composed
of mostly collagen.|61472002

The enamel|76993005
of the other scale types|74964007|278444000
is
reduced|260400001
to superficial ridges|26283006|26833005
and
ctenii.

Most ray-finned fishes|107315007|10117001
have
ctenoid scales.|19892000|13389002

In flatfishes,|107506004
some species|69658003
have
ctenoid scales|19892000|13389002
on the eyed side|81745001|182353008|244486005|182353008
and
cycloid scales|19892000|13389002
on the blind side,|182353008|182353008
while
other species|74964007|69658003
have
ctenoid scales|19892000|13389002
in males|248153007
and
cycloid scales|19892000|13389002
in females.|248152002

Ctenoid scales|19892000|13389002
can
be
further|46053002
subdivided
into three types|421291004|261664005
:

Cycloid
and
ctenoid scales|19892000|13389002
are
overlapping,|24846002
making
them more flexible|242762006|261012000
than cosmoid
and
ganoid scales.|19892000|13389002

They
grow
in size|277049003
through additions|260364009
to the margin,|112233002|82868003|372249001
creating
bands|77541009
of uneven seasonal growth|21864008
called
*
*annuli|112627000
*
*
(singluar
*
*annulus|112627000
*
*
).

These bands|77541009
can
be
used|394850002
to age|424144002
the fish.|90580008

Different groups|263735002|261586004|263735002|160481000
of fish|90580008
have
evolved|59381007
a number|410680006|410681005
of modified scales to|19892000|13389002|243326001|19892000|243326001|13389002
serve
various functions.|256220008|246464006

Many groups|260396001|261586004|260396001|160481000
of bony fishes,
including|55919000
pipefishes
and
seahorses,|409925000
several families|261028005|35359004
of catfishes,|107377008
sticklebacks,|107425003
and
poachers,
have
developed
external bony plates,|261074009|271003
structurally
resembling
placoid scales,|19892000|13389002
as
protective armour.

In the boxfishes,|107514005
the plates|271003
are
all
fused
together to
form|246176004
a rigid shell|16046003|44537007|261026009|44537007
enclosing|68947003
the entire body.|255503000|279495008|255503000|123037004|260232004|279495008|260232004|123037004

Yet
these bony plates|271003
are
not modified scales,|19892000|13389002|243326001|19892000|243326001|13389002
but
skin|119325001|39937001|181469002
that
has
been
ossified.
