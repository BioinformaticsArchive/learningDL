*Malaria|248437004
*
*
is
a mosquito-borne infectious disease|4730003
of humans|278412004
and
other animals|74964007|387961004
caused|23981006|134198009
by protists
(
a type|261664005
of microorganism|264395009
)
of the genus _Plasmodium_.|18511007|34706006

It
begins|255395001
with a bite|3404009|25272006
from an infected female mosquito,|248152002|359768004|224526002|359768004
which
introduces|127487003
the protists
via its saliva|256897009
into the circulatory system,|113257007
and
ultimately
to the liver|10200004|181268008
where they mature|34071009
and
reproduce.

The disease|64572001
causes|134198009
symptoms
that typically
include|55919000
fever|386661006
and
headache,|25064002
which
in severe cases|24484000|398241000|24484000|413769002
can
progress|385651009
to coma|371632003|405809000
or
death.|419620001|268923008

Malaria|248437004
is
widespread|85333001
in tropical
and
subtropical regions|410673009
in a broad band|90522003|77541009|90522003|255281001
around the equator,
including|55919000
much
of Sub-Saharan Africa,|409988000
Asia,|223500001
and
the Americas.

Five species|421820001|69658003
of _Plasmodium_|34706006
can
infect
and
be
transmitted|60117003|258150004
by humans.|278412004

The vast majority
of deaths|419620001|268923008
are
caused|23981006|134198009
by _[P.|20304007

cause|23981006|134198009
a generally milder form|255604002|246176004
of malaria|248437004
that
is
rarely fatal.|103356009|399166001

The zoonotic species _[P.|69658003

knowlesi]
(/wiki/Plasmodium_knowlesi|49918008
)
_,
prevalent
in Southeast Asia,|223585008
causes|134198009
malaria|248437004
in macaques|389173008
but
can
also
cause|23981006|134198009
severe infections|24484000
in humans.|278412004

Malaria|248437004
is
prevalent
in tropical
and
subtropical regions|410673009
because
rainfall,
warm temperatures,|246508008
and
stagnant waters|11713004
provide
habitats ideal
for mosquito larvae.|359768004

Disease transmission|64572001|258150004
can
be
reduced|260400001
by preventing mosquito bites|242635009|116699007|242635009
by distribution|255464007
of mosquito nets|359768004|255442003
and
insect repellents,|75627006
or
with mosquito-control|170511008
measures|246445000|367346004
such as spraying insecticides|55573003|33278000
and
draining standing water.|32712000|10904000|11713004|32712000|10904000|119318008

Malaria|248437004
is
typically
diagnosed|439401001
by the microscopic examination|117259009
of blood|87612001|119273009
using|260676000
blood films,|87612001|119273009
or
with antigen-based rapid diagnostic tests.|7120007|255358001|103693007|7120007|418836005|255358001|103693007

Modern techniques|272394005
that
use|277889008|419385000
the polymerase chain reaction to|258066000
detect|260373001
parasite DNA|37763007|24851008
have
also
been
developed
,
but
these
are
not widely
used|394850002
in malaria-endemic areas|248437004|42798000
due to their cost
and
complexity.|103360007

The World Health Organization|263775005|21139007
has
estimated|414135002
that
in 2010,
there
were
216 million documented cases|397934002|398241000|397934002|413769002
of malaria.|248437004

That year,|258707000|259039008
between 655,000
and
1.2 million people|303183002|125676002
died|419620001|419099009
from the disease|64572001
(roughly 2000?3000
per day|258703001|259032004
)
,
[1] many|260305007
of whom
were
children|410601007|160499008
in Africa.|223498002

The actual number|410680006|410681005
of deaths|419620001|268923008
is
not
known|36692007
with certainty,|17162000
as
precise statistics
are
unavailable|397854000
in many rural areas,|42798000
and
many cases|260396001|398241000|260396001|413769002
are
undocumented.

Malaria|248437004
is
commonly
associated|47429007
with poverty|11403006
and
may
also
be
a major hindrance|255603008
to economic development.|278923009

Despite a need,|410525008|103325001
no effective vaccine currently|255403003|398827000|15240007|254648000|398827000|15240007
exists
,
although
efforts to|19487008
develop
one|421379005
are
ongoing.|255238004

Several medications|261028005|410942007
are
available to|103328004
prevent
malaria|248437004
in travellers
to malaria-endemic countries|248437004|223369002
(prophylaxis.|169443000

A variety
of antimalarial medications|373287002|410942007
are
available.|103328004

Severe malaria|24484000|248437004
is
treated|28995006
with intravenous|255560000
or
intramuscular quinine|76601001|373497008|255559005|373497008
or
,
since
the mid-2000s,|255562008
the artemisinin derivative artesunate,|407745009|432555000
which
is
superior|261183002
to quinine|373497008
in
both
children|410601007|160499008
and
adults|133936004
and
is
given|419582001
in combination|89780004
with a second anti-malarial|81170007|373287002|257997001|373287002|288495006|373287002
such as mefloquine.|387505001

Resistance|30714006
has
developed
to several antimalarial drugs|261028005|373287002
;
for example,
chloroquine-resistant _P.|373468005|30714006

falciparum_
has
spread|410677005
to most malarial areas,|248437004|42798000
and
emerging resistance|30714006
to artemisinin|407745009
has
become
a problem|55607006
in some parts|260726005
of Southeast Asia.|223585008

The signs|72670004
and
symptoms
of malaria typically|248437004
begin|255395001
8?25 days|258703001
following|255260001
infection
;[2] however,|260306008
symptoms
may
occur|272120004
later
in those
who
have
taken|419652001
antimalarial medications|373287002|410942007
as prevention.|169443000

Initial manifestations|884001|250255003|884001|251190009|232714002|250255003|232714002|251190009
of the disease?common|64572001|72906007
to all malaria species?|248437004|69658003
are
similar
to flu-like symptoms,|315642008
[4]|260308009
and
can
resemble
other conditions|74964007|260905004
such as septicemia,|105592009
gastroenteritis,|25374005
and
viral diseases.|34014006

The presentation|246105001
may
include|55919000
headache,|25064002
fever,|386661006
shivering,
arthralgia|57676002
(joint pain|57676002
)
,
vomiting|249497008
,
hemolytic anemia,|61261009
jaundice,|18165001
hemoglobinuria,|68600005
retinal damage,|41445001
[5]|264706000|264605009
and
convulsions.

Approximately 30%|26175008
of people however|125676002
will
no longer|255511005
have
a fever|386661006
upon presenting|246105001
to a health care facility.|257622000

Owing to the non-specific nature|10003008|277302009
of disease presentation,|64572001|246105001
diagnosis|439401001
of malaria|248437004
in non-endemic countries|223369002
requires
a high degree|75540009|258395000|75540009|246173007|371879000|258395000|371879000|246173007
of suspicion,|22927000
which
might
be
elicited|263516000
by any
of the following|255260001
:
recent travel history,|6493001|420008001|6493001|420008001|392521001
splenomegaly|16294009
(enlarged spleen|16294009
)
,
fever|386661006
without localizing signs,|255471002|72670004
thrombocytopenia,|415116008
and
hyperbilirubinemia|14783006|26165005
combined|89780004
with a normal peripheral blood leukocyte count.[3]|17621005|119273009|767002|258744000|119273009|767002

The classic symptom|255301002|255333006
of malaria|248437004
is
paroxysm?|26593000
a cyclical occurrence|44180009|272120004
of sudden coldness|255363002|64713002
followed|367409002
by rigor|16046003|248457000
and
then fever|386661006
and
sweating,|161857006
occurring|272120004
every two days|420797005|258703001
in _P.|20304007

vivax_
and
_P.|20304007

ovale_ infections,
and
every three days|421291004|258703001
(tertian fever|248440004
)
for _P.|20304007

malariae_.

_P.|20304007

falciparum_ infection
can
cause|23981006|134198009
recurrent fever|420079008
every 36?48 hours|255249005
(quartan fever|248442007
)
or
a less|276139006|263796003
pronounced
and
almost continuous fever.[6]|271751000

Severe malaria|24484000|248437004
is
usually
caused|23981006|134198009
by _P.|20304007

falciparum_
(often|70232002
referred to|439980006
as
falciparum malaria|248441000
).

Symptoms
of falciparium malaria|248437004
arise|68727004
9?30 days|258703001
after infection.

Splenomegaly,|16294009
severe headache,|24484000|25064002
hepatomegaly|80515008
(enlarged liver|80515008
)
,
hypoglycemia,|271327008
and
hemoglobinuria|68600005
with renal failure|42399005
may
occur.|272120004

Renal failure|42399005
is
a feature
of blackwater fever,|56625005
where hemoglobin|38082009
from lysed red blood cells|371757000|14089001|371757000|41898006|371757000|258759006|371757000|126242007
leaks|87952002
into the urine.|78014005

Cerebral malaria|53622003
is
a form|246176004
of severe malaria|24484000|248437004
that
involves|248448006
encephalopathy specifically
related|272151006|262094002
to _P.|20304007

falciparum_ infection.

It
is
associated|47429007
with retinal whitening,|5665001|103067001
which
may
be
a useful clinical sign|58147004|72670004
in distinguishing malaria|248437004
from other causes|74964007|134198009
of fever.|386661006

Individuals|125676002|385435006
with cerebral malaria frequently|53622003|70232002
exhibit
neurological symptoms,|267070008
including|55919000
abnormal posturing,|43029002
nystagmus,|563001
conjugate gaze palsy|1534008
(failure|76797004
of the eyes to|81745001

in the same direction|262126009|260672003
)
,
opisthotonus,|8652009
seizures,|91175000
or
coma.[4]|371632003|405809000

There
are
a number|410680006|410681005
of serious complications|42745003|116223007
of malaria.|248437004

Among these
is
the development|278923009
of respiratory distress,|271825005
which
occurs|272120004
in
up to 25%
of adults|133936004
and
40%|259031006
of children|410601007|160499008
with severe _P.|24484000

falciparum_ malaria.|248441000

Possible causes|371930009|134198009|60022001|134198009
include|55919000
respiratory compensation|258162000|260234003|258162000|59811005|449071006|260234003|449071006|59811005
of metabolic acidosis,|59455009
noncardiogenic pulmonary oedema,|67782005
concomitant pneumonia,|79970003|205237003
and
severe anaemia.|24484000|271737000

Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)|67782005
may
develop
in 5?25%|264706000|264605009
in adults|133936004
and
up to 29%
of pregnant women|255409004

Coinfection
with HIV|19030005|86406008|402916007
and
malaria|248437004
increases|260366006
mortality.[9]|409651001

Malaria|248437004
in pregnant women|255409004
is
an important cause|134198009
of stillbirths,|237364002
infant mortality|418119000|409651001
and
low birth weight,[10] particularly|276610007

A sporozoite travels|103545008|420008001
through the blood vessels|59820001
to liver cells|30396005
(hepatocytes,|30396005
where
it
reproduces
asexually
(tissue schizogony,|85756007
producing
thousands
of merozoites.|103543001

These
infect
new red blood cells|7147002|14089001|7147002|41898006|7147002|258759006|7147002|126242007
and
initiate
a series|13039001
of asexual multiplication cycles|44180009
(blood schizogony|87612001|119273009
)
that
produce
8
to 24 new infective merozoites,|7147002|103543001
at which
point
the cells|4421005
burst|255331008
and
the infective cycle|44180009
begins|255395001
anew.

In a process|415178003
called
_gametocytogenesis_,
other merozoites|74964007|103543001
develop
into immature gametes,|1090009|308838004
or
gametocytes.|103536007

When
a fertilised mosquito bites|242635009
an infected person,|125676002
gametocytes|103536007
are
taken|419652001
up
with the blood|87612001|119273009
and
mature|34071009
in the mosquito gut.|359768004|122865005

The male|248153007
and
female gametocytes|248152002|103536007|224526002|103536007
fuse
and
form zygotes|246176004|57323001
(ookinetes,|103542006
which
develop
into new sporozoites.|7147002|103545008

The sporozoites|103545008
migrate
to the insect's salivary glands,|106763003|75535001
ready to
infect
a new vertebrate host.|7147002|387967000

The sporozoites|103545008
are
injected|422145002
into the skin,|119325001|39937001|181469002
alongside saliva,|256897009
when
the mosquito|359768004
takes|419652001
a subsequent blood meal.|255260001|87612001|255260001|119273009

This type|261664005
of transmission|258150004
is
occasionally
referred|439980006
to
as
anterior station transfer.[18]|255549009|255323003|302265009

Only female mosquitoes|50607009|248152002|359768004|50607009|224526002|359768004|420295001|248152002|359768004|420295001|224526002|359768004
feed|129007004
on blood|87612001|119273009
;
male mosquitoes|248153007|359768004
feed|129007004
on plant nectar,|31006001
and
thus
do
not
transmit|60117003
the disease.|64572001

The females|248152002
of the _Anopheles_ genus|54190007
of mosquito prefer to|359768004|225773000
feed|129007004
at night.|2546009

They usually
start|255395001
searching
for a meal
at dusk,|48786000
and
will
continue|255238004
throughout the night|2546009
until taking
a meal.

Malaria parasites
can
also
be
transmitted|60117003|258150004
by blood transfusions,
although
this
is
rare.[20]|84638005|103356009

Symptoms
of malaria|248437004
can
reappear
(recur|246455001
)
after
varying symptom-free periods.|37837009|259037005

Depending
upon the cause,|134198009
recurrence|246455001
can
be
classified|73504009
as
either
recrudescence,
relapse,|263855007|255318003|58184002
or
reinfection.|255230006

Recrudescence
is
when
symptoms
return|7528007
after a symptom-free period.|37837009|259037005

It
is
caused|23981006|134198009
by parasites|37763007
surviving
in the blood|87612001|119273009
as a result|394617004
of inadequate|71978007
or
ineffective treatment.|276239002|416118004

Relapse|263855007|255318003|58184002
is
when
symptoms
reappear
after the parasites|37763007
have
been
eliminated
from blood|87612001|119273009
but
persist
as dormant hypnozoites|103546009
in liver cells.|30396005

Relapse|263855007|255318003|58184002
commonly
occurs|272120004
between 8?24 weeks|258705008
and
is
commonly
seen
with _P.|20304007

vivax_
and
_P.|20304007

ovale_ infections.

_P.|20304007

vivax_ malaria cases|27052006|398241000|27052006|413769002
in temperate areas often|42798000|70232002
involve|248448006
overwintering
by hypnozoites,|103546009
with relapses|263855007
beginning|255395001
the year|258707000|259039008
after the mosquito bite.|242635009

Reinfection means|255230006|255586005
the parasite|37763007
that
caused|23981006|134198009
the past infection|410513005
was
eliminated
from the body|279495008|123037004
but
a new parasite|7147002|37763007
was
introduced.|127487003

Reinfection|255230006
cannot
readily
be
distinguished
from recrudescence,
although
recurrence|246455001
of infection
within two weeks|420797005|258705008
of treatment|276239002|416118004
for the initial infection|884001|232714002
is
typically
attributed|246061005
to treatment failure.[23]|276239002|76797004|264657009|416118004|76797004|264657009

Malaria infection|248437004
develops
via two phases|420797005|272108007
:
one|421379005
that
involves|248448006
the liver|10200004|181268008
(exoerythrocytic phase|21191007
)
,
and
one|421379005
that
involves|248448006
red blood cells,|14089001|41898006|258759006|126242007
or
erythrocytes|14089001|41898006
(erythrocytic phase|41898006|21191007
).

When
an infected mosquito|359768004
pierces
a person's skin to|125676002|119325001|125676002|39937001|125676002|181469002
take|419652001
a blood meal,|87612001|119273009
sporozoites|103545008
in the mosquito's saliva|359768004|256897009
enter|417985001
the bloodstream
and
migrate
to the liver|10200004|181268008
where they
infect
hepatocytes,|30396005
multiplying|421206002
asexually
and
asymptomatically
for a period|259037005
of 8?30 days.[24]|258703001

After a potential dormant period|30207005|259037005
in the liver,|10200004|181268008
these organisms|410653004
differentiate|263933003
to
yield
thousands
of merozoites,|103543001
which,
following|255260001
rupture|415747007
of their host cells,|4421005
escape
into the blood|87612001|119273009
and
infect
red blood cells to|14089001|41898006|258759006|126242007
begin|255395001
the erythrocytic stage|41898006|21191007|41898006|371508000|41898006|261612004
of the life cycle.|224130005|44180009

The parasite escapes|37763007
from the liver|10200004|181268008
undetected
by wrapping|262318008
itself
in the cell membrane|53982002
of the infected host liver cell.[25]|30396005

Within the red blood cells,|14089001|41898006|258759006|126242007
the parasites multiply further,|37763007|421206002|46053002
again asexually,
periodically|81591007
breaking
out of their host cells to|4421005
invade
fresh red blood cells.|261013005|14089001|261013005|41898006|261013005|258759006|261013005|126242007

Several|261028005
such amplification cycles|44180009
occur.|272120004

Thus,
classical descriptions|255333006|260997001
of waves
of fever|386661006
arise|68727004
from simultaneous waves|79970003
of merozoites escaping|103543001
and
infecting red blood cells.[24]|14089001|41898006|258759006|126242007

Some _P.|20304007

vivax_ sporozoites|103545008
do
not immediately|49499008
develop
into exoerythrocytic-phase merozoites,|21191007|103543001
but
instead
produce
hypnozoites|103546009
that
remain
dormant
for periods|259037005
ranging
from several months|261028005|258706009
(7?10 months|258706009
is
typical
)
to several years.|261028005|258707000

After a period|259037005
of dormancy,
they
reactivate|59086009
and
produce
merozoites.|103543001

Hypnozoites|103546009
are
responsible|394851003
for long incubation|255511005
and
late|260383002
relapses|263855007
in _P.|20304007

vivax_ infections,
[22]
although
their existence
in _P.|20304007

ovale_
is
uncertain.[26]|64957009

The parasite|37763007
is
relatively
protected
from attack|217315002|216299002
by the body's immune system because|278195005|255386009|91689009|255386009|279495008|116003000|123037004|116003000
for most
of its human life cycle|278412004|224130005|44180009
it
resides
within the liver|10200004|181268008
and
blood cells|63370004
and
is
relatively invisible|66486002
to immune surveillance.|47196002

However,
circulating|65929005
infected blood cells|63370004
are
destroyed
in the spleen.|78961009|181279003

To
avoid
this fate,|399166001
the _P.|20304007

falciparum_ parasite|37763007
displays
adhesive proteins|8170008|88878007
on the surface|410678000
of the infected blood cells,|63370004
causing|23981006
the blood cells to|63370004
stick
to the walls|224727009
of small blood vessels,|27915009
thereby
sequestering
the parasite|37763007
from passage|255592004
through the general circulation|60132005|413854007
and
the spleen.|78961009|181279003

The blockage
of the microvasculature|263809005
causes|134198009
symptoms
such as
in placental malaria.|62669004|248437004|388033005|248437004

Sequestered
red blood cells|14089001|41898006|258759006|126242007
can
breach
the blood?brain barrier|20245001
and
cause|23981006|134198009
cerebral malaria.[29]|53622003

Although
the red blood cell surface adhesive proteins|41898006|410678000|8170008|88878007
(called PfEMP1,
for _P.|20304007

falciparum_ erythrocyte membrane protein 1|41898006|83097008|88878007
)
are
exposed|24932003
to the immune system,|116003000
they
do
not
serve
as good immune targets|20572008|255386009
because of their extreme diversity|12565001
;
there
are
at least 60 variations|276139006|40885006|263796003|40885006
of the protein|88878007
within a single parasite|125681006|37763007|50607009|37763007
and
even more variants|40885006
within whole parasite populations.|260232004|37763007|385436007

The parasite switches|37763007
through a broad repertoire|90522003
of PfEMP1 surface proteins,|410678000|88878007
thereby
avoiding
detection
by protective antibodies.[30]|68498002

Due to the high levels|75540009|258395000|371879000|258395000
of mortality|409651001
and
morbidity
caused|23981006|134198009
by malaria?especially|248437004
the _P.|20304007

falciparum_ species?|69658003
it
has
placed|257557008|421066005
the greatest selective pressure|4757001|279046003|4757001|13543005|4757001|257893003
on the human genome|50470001
in recent history.|6493001|6493001|392521001

Several genetic factors|261028005|3950001|261028005|255395001
provide
some resistance|30714006
to it
including|55919000
sickle cell trait,|16402000
thalassaemia traits,|19442009
glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency,|124134002
and
the absence|2667000|418560003
of Duffy antigens|7120007
on red blood cells.[31][32]|14089001|264664006|41898006|264664006|258759006|264664006|126242007|264664006

The impact|134293005
of sickle cell trait|16402000
on malaria immunity|248437004|58915005
is
of particular interest.|225469004

Sickle cell trait|16402000
causes|134198009
a defect|6920004
in the hemoglobin molecule|38082009|290005005
in the blood.|87612001|119273009

Instead of retaining|397909002
the biconcave shape|107644003|246176004|300842002
of a normal red blood cell,|17621005|41898006|258744000|41898006
the modified hemoglobin S molecule|50095005|290005005|243326001|50095005|290005005
causes|134198009
the cell|4421005|362837007
to sickle
or
distort
into a curved shape.|60301000|107644003|60301000|246176004|60301000|300842002

Due to the sickle shape,|107644003|246176004|300842002
the molecule|290005005
is
not
as effective|255403003|254648000
in taking
or
releasing oxygen,|129299003|24099007
and
therefore malaria parasites
cannot
complete|255594003
their life cycle|224130005|44180009
in the cell.|4421005|362837007

Individuals|125676002|385435006
who
are
homozygous|22061001
(
with two copies|420797005
of the abnormal hemoglobin beta allele|8257005|52095000|9109004|8257005|260989008|9109004|52095000|9109004|260989008|9109004
have
sickle-cell anaemia,|417357006
while
those who
are
heterozygous|14556007
(
with one abnormal allele|421379005|263654008|9109004

Although
the potential risk|30207005|30207005
of death|419620001|268923008
for those with the homozygous condition|20401003|22061001|260905004|421463005|22061001|260905004
seems
to
be
unfavourable
to population survival,|385436007|389109008
the trait
is
preserved|277405005
because of the benefits
provided
by the heterozygous form.[32]|14556007|246176004

Liver dysfunction|75183008
as a result|394617004
of malaria|248437004
is
rare|84638005|103356009
and
is
usually
a result|394617004
of a coexisting liver condition|10200004|260905004|181268008|260905004
such as viral hepatitis|3738000
or
chronic liver disease.|328383001

The syndrome
is
sometimes
called
_malarial hepatitis_,|83072009
although
inflammation|257552002
of the liver|10200004|181268008
(hepatitis|128241005|40468003|396423004

not actually
occur.|272120004

While
traditionally
considered
a rare occurrence,|84638005|272120004|103356009|272120004
malarial hepatopathy|248437004|235856003

seen
an increase,|260366006

in Southeast Asia|223585008

Liver compromise|10200004|181268008
in people|125676002

correlates
with a greater likelihood|263768009|2931005

the most commonly used method to|4757001|394850002|260686004|4757001|394850002|272394005
detect|260373001
the malaria parasite?
about 165 million blood smears|87612001|119273009
were
performed|398166005
in 2010.

Despite its widespread usage,|85333001|277889008
diagnosis|439401001
by microscopy suffers|117259009
from two main drawbacks|420797005|63161005
:
many settings
(especially rural
)
are
not
equipped
to
perform|398166005
the test,|269814003|272393004
and
the accuracy|263656005
of the results|394617004
depends
on both
the skill
of the person|125676002
reading|50360004
the smear
and
the levels|258395000
of the parasite|37763007
in the blood.|87612001|119273009

The sensitivity|35209006|365705006
of blood films|87612001|119273009
ranges
from 75?90%|264705001|264703008
in optimum conditions,|260905004
to
as
low|62482003|371880002
as 50%.

Commercially available RDTs|103328004|83118000
are
often more accurate|70232002|263656005
than blood smears|87612001|119273009
at predicting
the presence|386397008
of malaria parasites,
but
they
are
widely variable|255372005
in diagnostic sensitivity and specificity|439401001|35209006|69658003|439401001|365705006|69658003|261004008|35209006|69658003|261004008|365705006|69658003
depending
on manufacturer,
and
are
unable to tell|371151008
how
many parasites|37763007
are
present.[36]|52101004|246105001

In regions|410673009
where laboratory tests|269814003
are
readily available, malaria|103328004|248437004
should
be
suspected|415684004
,
and
tested|272393004
for,
in any unwell patient|116154003
who
has
been
in an area|42798000
where malaria|248437004
is
endemic.

In areas|42798000
that
cannot
afford
laboratory diagnostic tests,|261904005|103693007
it
has
become
routine to|50811001
use|277889008|419385000
only
a history|392521001
of subjective fever|255362007|386661006
as the indication to|410666004
treat|395077000
for malaria?|248437004
a presumptive approach
exemplified
by the common teaching "fever|72906007|409073007|386661006
equals|9726003|276136004
malaria|248437004
unless
proven|277025001
otherwise".

The drawback
of this practice,
however,
is
overdiagnosis
of malaria|248437004
and
mismanagement
of non-malarial fever,|248437004
which
wastes
limited resources,|255469002
erodes|424714008
confidence|225487001
in the health care system,|263775005|246333005
and
contributes
to drug resistance.|31438003

Although
polymerase chain reaction-based tests|258066000|269814003|258066000|272393004|258066000|418836005|269814003|258066000|418836005|272393004
have
been
developed
,
these
are
not widely
implemented
in malaria-endemic regions|248437004|410673009
as of 2012,
due to their complexity.[3]|103360007

Malaria|248437004
is
divided|422033008
into severe|24484000
and
uncomplicated|263914008
by the World Health Organization (WHO).|263775005|21139007

Severe malaria|24484000|248437004
is
diagnosed|439401001
when
any
of the following criteria|255260001
are
present, otherwise|52101004|246105001
it
is
considered
uncomplicated.[38]|263914008|264670000

According to the
WHO,
cerebral malaria|53622003
is
defined
as a severe _P.|24484000

falciparum_-malaria|248441000
presenting|246105001
neurological symptoms,|267070008
including|55919000
coma|371632003|405809000
(
with a Glasgow coma scale rating|386554004
of greater|263768009
than 11,
or
a Blantyre coma scale|371632003|19892000|371632003|278111002|405809000|19892000|405809000|278111002
greater|263768009
than 3|260313008
)
,
or
with a coma|371632003|405809000
that lasts
longer|255511005
than 30 minutes|259030007
after a seizure.[39]|91175000

Methods|260686004|272394005
used|394850002
to
prevent
malaria|248437004
include|55919000
medications,|410942007
mosquito elimination|359768004|63911002
and
the prevention|169443000
of bites.|3404009

The presence|386397008
of malaria|248437004
in an area|42798000
requires
a combination|89780004
of high human population density,|75540009|278412004|385436007|125146005|75540009|278412004|389109008|125146005|371879000|278412004|385436007|125146005|371879000|278412004|389109008|125146005
high mosquito population density|75540009|359768004|385436007|125146005|75540009|359768004|389109008|125146005|371879000|359768004|385436007|125146005|371879000|359768004|389109008|125146005
and
high rates|75540009|371879000
of transmission|258150004
from humans|278412004
to mosquitoes|359768004
and
from mosquitoes|359768004
to humans.|278412004

If
any
of these
is
lowered sufficiently,|261122009|385440003
the parasite|37763007
will
eventually
disappear
from
that area,|42798000
as
happened
in North America,|223503004
Europe|223502009
and
much
of the Middle East.|223605000

However,
unless
the parasite|37763007
is
eliminated
from the whole world,|260232004
it
could
become
re-established|228877007|263748003|228877007|385645004
if conditions|260905004
revert
to a combination|89780004
that favours
the parasite's reproduction.[40]|37763007|263767004|259031006

Many researchers|260396001
argue
that prevention|169443000
of malaria|248437004
may
be
more cost-effective|242762006|255403003|242762006|254648000
than treatment|276239002|416118004
of the disease|64572001
in the long|255511005
run|418060005|282476009
,
but
the capital costs
required
are
out of reach|282679008
of many|260396001
of the world's poorest people.|11403006|125676002|255351007|125676002

There
is
a wide disparity|90522003
in the costs
of control|31509003
(i.e.|42146005|22971001

maintenance
of low endemicity|62482003|371880002
)
and
elimination|63911002
programs
between countries.|223369002

For example,
in China?|223581004
whose government
in 2010
announced
a strategy
to pursue malaria elimination|248437004|63911002
in the Chinese provinces?|297876005|33897005
the required investment
is
a small proportion|255507004|8212001
of public expenditure
on health.|263775005

In contrast,
a similar program
in Tanzania|223537007
would
cost
an estimated one-fifth|414135002|421379005|32088001
of the public health budget.[41]|310115006|300715005

Vector control refers|275824000|439980006
to preventative methods|260686004|272394005
used|394850002
to
decrease|260400001|260370003
malaria|248437004
and
morbidity
and
mortality|409651001
by reducing|260400001
the levels|258395000
of transmission.|258150004

For individual protection,|125676002|385435006
the most effective chemical insect repellents to|4757001|255403003|441900009|75627006|4757001|254648000|441900009|75627006
reduce|260400001
human-mosquito contact|278412004|359768004|11723008|278412004|359768004|70862002
are
those
based|418836005
on DEET|16968005
and
picaridin.|416559004

Insecticide-treated mosquito nets (ITNs)|33278000|28995006|359768004|255442003
and
indoor residual spraying (IRS)|65320000|55573003
have
been
shown
to
be
highly effective vector control interventions|75540009|255403003|275824000|225334002|75540009|254648000|275824000|225334002
in preventing malaria morbidity|248437004|116699007|248437004
and
mortality|409651001
among children|410601007|160499008
in malaria-endemic settings.|248437004

IRS
is
the practice
of spraying insecticides|55573003|33278000
on the interior walls|224727009
of homes|261770009
in malaria-affected areas.|248437004|247591002|42798000|248437004|248448006|42798000

After feeding,|129007004
many mosquito species|359768004|69658003
rest|258157001
on a nearby surface|410678000
while
digesting
the bloodmeal,
so
if
the walls|224727009
of dwellings|261770009
have
been
coated|228224007
with insecticides,|33278000
the resting mosquitoes|258157001|359768004
can
be
killed|248007002
before
they
can
bite|3404009|25272006
another victim
and
transfer|129347002|302265009|129005007
the malaria parasite.

As of 2006,
the World Health Organization|263775005|21139007
advises|424900004
the use|277889008|419385000
of 12 insecticides|33278000
in IRS operations,|83578000
including|55919000
DDT
and
the pyrethroids cyfluthrin|311846002
and
deltamethrin.|90670002

This public health use|310115006|277889008|310115006|419385000
of small amounts|255507004|107651007
of DDT
is
permitted|958006
under the Stockholm Convention|255333006
on Persistent Organic Pollutants (POPs),
which
prohibits
the agricultural use|277889008|419385000
of DDT.[47]

One problem|421379005|55607006
with all
forms|246176004
of IRS
is
insecticide resistance|33278000|30714006
via evolution.

Mosquitoes|359768004
that
are
affected|247591002|248448006
by IRS
tend
to
rest|258157001
and
live indoors,|419749002
and
due to the irritation|257553007
caused|23981006|134198009
by spraying,|55573003
their descendants
tend
to
rest|258157001
and
live outdoors,|419749002
meaning|255586005
that
they
are
not
as
affected?|247591002|248448006
if
affected|247591002|248448006
at all?
by the IRS,
which greatly
reduces|260400001
its effectiveness|255403003
as a defense mechanism.[48]|224992003

Mosquito nets|359768004|255442003
help
keep
mosquitoes away|359768004
from people|125676002
and
significantly
reduce|260400001
infection rates
and
transmission|258150004
of malaria.|248437004

The nets|255442003
are
not
a perfect barrier
and
they
are
often|70232002
treated|28995006
with an insecticide|33278000
designed
to
kill|248007002
the mosquito|359768004
before
it
has
time to|410669006
search
for a way past
the net.|255442003

Insecticide-treated nets|33278000|28995006|255442003
are
estimated|414135002
to
be
twice|421832002
as effective|255403003|254648000
as untreated nets|25265005|255442003
and
offer|410527000
greater|263768009
than 70% protection
compared
with no net.|255442003

Between 2000
and
2008,
the use|277889008|419385000
of ITNs
saved
the lives|224130005
of an estimated 250,000 infants|414135002|418119000
in Sub-Saharan Africa.|409988000

Although
ITNs
prevent
malaria,|248437004
only about 13%|50607009|420295001
of households
in Sub-Saharan countries|261089000|223369002|118555000|223369002
own
them.

A recommended practice
for usage|277889008
is
to
hang
a large "bed net"|255509001|229772003|255442003
above the center|26216008
of a bed to|229772003
drape
over|21481007
it completely
with the edges|57183005
tucked|10942006
in.

Pyrethroid-treated nets|311846002|28995006|255442003
and
long-lasting insecticide-treated nets|255511005|33278000|28995006|255442003
offer|410527000
the best personal protection,|20572008|3442003
and
are
most effective|4757001|255403003|4757001|254648000
when
used|394850002
from dusk|48786000
to dawn.[52]

Community participation|133928008
and
health education strategies
promoting
awareness|312012004
of malaria|248437004
and
the importance
of control measures|31509003|246445000|31509003|367346004
have
been
successfully
used|394850002
to
reduce|260400001
the incidence
of malaria|248437004
in some areas|42798000
of the developing world.

Recognizing
the disease|64572001
in the early stages|264499004|261612004
can
stop|422117008
the disease|64572001
from
becoming
fatal.|399166001

Education|266981003|409073007
can
also
inform|410938009|223458004
people to|125676002
cover|255334000
over areas|42798000
of stagnant, still water,|11713004|119318008
such as water|11713004|119318008
tanks|16916003
that
are
ideal breeding grounds
for the parasite|37763007
and
mosquito,|359768004
thus
cutting|70302008|410717008
down the risk|30207005
of the transmission|258150004
between people.|125676002

This
is
generally
used|394850002
in urban areas|224807002|42798000
where there
are
large centers|255509001|26216008
of population|385436007|389109008
in a confined space
and
transmission|258150004
would
be
most likely|4757001|2931005
in these areas.|42798000

Intermittent preventive therapy|7087005|262073000|276239002|7087005|129428001|276239002
is
another intervention|225334002
that
has
been
used|394850002
successfully to
control|31509003
malaria|248437004
in pregnant women|255409004
and
infants,|418119000
[55]|264691008
and
in preschool children|410602000
where transmission|258150004
is
seasonal.[56]|21864008

Several drugs,|261028005|410942007
most
of which
are
used|394850002
for treatment|276239002|416118004
of malaria,|248437004
can
be
taken|419652001
to
prevent
contracting|78558002
the disease|64572001
during travel|420008001
to endemic areas.|42798000

Chloroquine|373468005
may
be
used|394850002
where the parasite|37763007
is
still sensitive.|83185005

However,
due to resistance one|30714006|421379005
of three medications?mefloquine|421291004|410942007|387505001
(_Lariam_
)
,
doxycycline|372478003
(available generically|103328004
)
,
or
the combination|89780004
of atovaquone|386899002
and
proguanil hydrochloride|395845004
(_Malarone_
)?
is
frequently|70232002
needed.|410525008|103325001

Doxycycline|372478003
and
the atovaquone|386899002
and
proguanil combination|16970001|89780004
are
the best|20572008|3442003
tolerated
;
mefloquine|387505001
is
associated|47429007
with death,|419620001|268923008
suicide,|44301001
and
higher rates|75540009|371879000
of neurological|1199008

The prophylactic effect|322837006|253861007|262073000|253861007|253861007
does
not
begin|255395001
immediately|49499008
upon starting|255395001|385652002
the drugs,|410942007
so
people temporarily|125676002
visiting
malaria-endemic areas usually|248437004|42798000
begin|255395001
taking|419652001
the drugs|410942007
one|421379005
to two weeks|420797005|258705008
before arriving

taking
them
for four weeks|421534005|258705008
after leaving|7771000|90737002
(
with the exception
of atovaquone proguanil|421285001
that only|50607009|420295001
needs|410525008|103325001

Use|277889008|419385000
of prophylactic drugs|322837006|410942007|262073000|410942007|410942007
is
seldom practical|103356009
for full-time residents|160903007|405277009
of malaria-endemic areas,|248437004|42798000
and
their use|277889008|419385000
is
usually
restricted|263856008
to short-term visitors
and
travellers
to malarial regions.|248437004|410673009

This
is
due to the cost
of purchasing
the drugs,|410942007
negative adverse effects|260385009
from long-term use,|277889008|419385000
and
because
some effective anti-malarial drugs|255403003|373287002|410942007|254648000|373287002|410942007

The treatment|276239002|416118004
of malaria|248437004
depends
on the severity|272141005
of the disease.|64572001

Uncomplicated malaria|263914008|248437004
may
be
treated|28995006
with oral medications.|260548002|410942007

The most effective strategy|4757001|255403003|4757001|254648000
for _P.|20304007

falciparum_ infection
is
the use|277889008|419385000
of artemisinins|407745009
in combination|89780004
with other antimalarials|74964007|373287002
(
known|36692007
as artemisinin-combination therapy,|407745009|229554006
or
ACT
)
,
which
reduces|260400001
the ability|371150009
of the parasite to|37763007
develop
resistance|30714006
to any single drug component.|125681006|410942007|246093002|50607009|410942007|246093002

These additional antimalarials|260364009|373287002
include|55919000
amodiaquine,|387352008
lumefantrine,|420307001
mefloquine|387505001
or
sulfadoxine/pyrimethamine.|398770008

Another recommended combination|89780004
is
dihydroartemisinin
and
piperaquine.

ACT
is
about 90% effective|264705001|255403003|264705001|254648000|264703008|255403003|264703008|254648000
when
used|394850002
to
treat|395077000
uncomplicated malaria.|263914008|248437004

To
treat|395077000
malaria|248437004
during pregnancy,|289908002
the
WHO
recommends
the use|277889008|419385000
of quinine|373497008
plus
clindamycin early|372786004|264499004
in the pregnancy|289908002
(1st trimester|255246003

,
and
ACT
in later stages|260383002|261612004
(2nd|81170007
and
3rd trimesters|255248002
).

In the 2000s
(decade
)
,
malaria|248437004
with partial resistance|255609007|30714006
to artemisins
emerged
in Southeast Asia.[66][67]|223585008

Severe malaria|24484000|248437004
requires
the parenteral administration|413454004|416118004
of antimalarial drugs.|373287002

Until the mid-2000s|255562008
the most used treatment|4757001|394850002|276239002|4757001|394850002|416118004
for severe malaria|24484000|248437004
was
quinine,|373497008
but
artesunate|432555000
has
been
shown
to
be
superior|261183002
to quinine|373497008
in
both
children|410601007|160499008

adults.|133936004

Treatment|276239002|416118004
of severe malaria also|24484000|248437004
involves|248448006
supportive measures|246445000|367346004
that
are
optimally
performed|398166005
in a critical care unit,|309904001

However,
severe malaria|24484000|248437004
can
progress|385651009

days.|258703001

In the most severe cases|4757001|24484000|398241000|4757001|24484000|413769002
of the disease,|64572001

reach|282679008
20%,
even
with intensive care

Over the longer term, developmental impairments|278923009|40226000
have
been
documented|397934002
in children|410601007|160499008

Malaria|248437004
causes|134198009
widespread anemia|85333001|271737000
during a period|259037005
of rapid brain development,|255358001|12738006|278923009|255358001|258335003|278923009
and
also
direct|255589003
brain damage.|2470005

This neurologic damage|128239009
results|394617004
from cerebral malaria|53622003
to which children|410601007|160499008

more vulnerable.|242762006

Some survivors

Based|418836005
on documented cases,|397934002|398241000|397934002|413769002
the
WHO
estimates|414135002
that there
were
216 million cases|398241000|413769002
of malaria|248437004
in 2010
resulting|42752001
in 655,000 deaths.|419620001|268923008

This
is
equivalent to roughly 2000 deaths|9726003|419620001|9726003|268923008|258726008|419620001|258726008|268923008
every day.|69620002

A 2012 study|110465008|224699009
estimated|414135002
the number|410680006|410681005
of documented|397934002
and
undocumented deaths|419620001|268923008
in 2010

The majority
of cases|398241000|413769002
(65%|264695004

occur|272120004
in children|410601007|160499008
under 15 years old.|258707000|70753007

Pregnant women|255409004
are
also especially vulnerable
:
about 125 million pregnant women|255409004
are
at risk|410519009
of infection
each year.|258707000|259039008

In Sub-Saharan Africa,|409988000
maternal malaria|72705000|248437004
is
associated|47429007
with
up to 200,000 estimated infant deaths yearly.|414135002|160956009|53281000

There
are
about 10,000 malaria cases|248437004|398241000|248437004|413769002

reduced|260400001
by over|21481007
a third|70905002
from a 2000 estimate|414135002
of 985,000,
largely
due to the widespread use|85333001|277889008|85333001|419385000

An estimate|414135002
for 2009
reported|229059009|223458004
that countries|223369002
with the highest death rate|75540009|409651001|371879000|409651001
per 100,000

The Malaria Atlas|248437004|14806007
Project
aims
to
map|360220002
global endemic levels|60132005|258395000
of malaria,|248437004
providing
a means|255586005
with which to
determine
the global spatial limits|60132005|255469002
of the disease|64572001
and
to
assess
disease burden.|64572001

This effort|19487008
led|88488004|236874000
to the publication
of a map
of _P.|20304007

falciparum_ endemicity
in 2010.

As of 2010,
about 100 countries|223369002
have
endemic malaria.|248437004

Every year,|258707000|259039008
125 million international travellers
visit
these countries,|223369002
and
more
than 30,000
contract|78558002
the disease.[42]|64572001

The geographic distribution|255464007
of malaria|248437004
within large regions|255509001|410673009
is
complex,|103360007
and
malaria-|248437004
afflicted
and
malaria-free areas|248437004|37837009|42798000
are
often|70232002
found close|404684003|29179001|29179001
to each other.

Malaria|248437004
is
prevalent
in tropical
and
subtropical regions|410673009
because of rainfall,
consistent high temperatures|385433004|285717004
and
high humidity,|86508006
along
with stagnant waters|11713004
in which mosquito larvae|359768004
readily mature|34071009
,
providing
them
with the environment|276339004
they
need|410525008|103325001
for continuous breeding.|255238004

In drier areas,|42798000
outbreaks|443684005
of malaria|248437004
have
been
predicted
with reasonable accuracy|410666004|263656005
by mapping rainfall.|360220002

Malaria|248437004
is
more common|242762006|72906007
in rural areas|42798000
than
in cities.|284560003

For example,
several cities|261028005|284560003
in the Greater Mekong Subregion|263768009
of Southeast Asia|223585008
are
essentially malaria-free,|248437004|37837009
but
the disease|64572001
is
prevalent
in many rural regions,|410673009
including|55919000
along international borders|112233002
and
forest fringes.|257616009

In contrast,
malaria|248437004
in Africa|223498002
is
present|52101004|246105001
in
both
rural
and
urban areas,|224807002|42798000
though
the risk|30207005
is
lower|261122009
in the larger cities.[88]|255509001|284560003|263768009|284560003

Although
the parasite|37763007
responsible|394851003
for _P.|20304007

falciparum_ malaria|248441000
has
been
in existence
for 50,000?100,000 years,|258707000
the population size|385436007|277049003|389109008|277049003
of the parasite|37763007
did
not
increase|260366006
until about 10,000 years ago,|258707000
concurrently
with advances|86005002
in agriculture[89]
and
the development|278923009
of human settlements.|278412004

Close relatives|29179001|125677006
of the human malaria parasites|307274002|248437004
remain
common|72906007
in chimpanzees.|1480007

Some evidence|18669006
suggests
that
the _P.|20304007

falciparum_ malaria|248441000
may
have
originated
in gorillas.[90]|8807009|264705001|8807009|264703008

References
to the unique periodic fevers|81591007|386661006
of malaria|248437004

beginning|255395001
in 2700 BC

Malaria|248437004
may
have
contributed
to the decline
of the Roman Empire,|223655008
[92]
and
was
so pervasive|223528007|85333001
in Rome
that
it
was
known|36692007
as the "Roman fever".|223655008|386661006

Several regions|261028005|410673009
in ancient Rome
were
considered
at-risk|410519009
for the disease|64572001
because of the favourable conditions|260905004
present|52101004|246105001
for malaria vectors.|248437004|260529001

This included areas|55919000|42798000
such as southern Italy,|223668000
the island|288560006
of Sardinia,|223839004
the Pontine Marshes,|49557009|248437004
the lower regions|261122009|410673009
of coastal Etruria
and
the city|284560003
of Rome
along the Tiber River.|420531007

The presence|386397008
of stagnant water|11713004|119318008
in these places|257557008
was
preferred|225773000
by mosquitoes|359768004
for breeding grounds.

from road construction|272510001|410615009
led|88488004|236874000
to the increase|260366006
of standing water.[94]|10904000|11713004|10904000|119318008

The term malaria|248437004
originates
from Medieval Italian|297502002|31637002
:
_mala aria_ ? "bad air"|556001|417696007
;
the disease|64572001
was
formerly
called
_ague_|43724002|248457000
or
_marsh fever_|248437004
due to its association|263534001|272151006
with swamps|111059006
and
marshland.

Malaria|248437004
was
once
common|72906007
in most
of Europe|223502009
and
North America,|223503004
[96]
where it
is
no longer endemic,[97]|255511005|260309001|255511005|264708004
though
imported cases|398241000|413769002
do
occur.[98]|272120004

Malaria|248437004
was
the most important health hazard|4757001|263775005
encountered
by U.S.|223688001

troops
in the South Pacific
during World War II,
where about 500,000 men|339947000
were
infected.

According to Joseph Patrick Byrne,
"Sixty thousand American soldiers
died|419620001|419099009
of malaria|248437004
during the African|413464008
and
South Pacific campaigns."[100] Scientific studies|110465008|224699009
on malaria|248437004
made
their first significant advance|255216001|386134007|86005002|232714002|386134007|86005002
in 1880,
when
Charles Louis Alphonse Laveran?
a French army doctor working|19434008|309343006|261041009
in the military hospital|302314004|302314004|285201006
of Constantine
in Algeria?observed parasites|223510005|37763007
inside the red blood cells|14089001|41898006|258759006|126242007
of infected people|125676002
for the first time.|255216001|410669006|232714002|410669006

He therefore
proposed
that malaria|248437004
is
caused|23981006|134198009
by this organism,|410653004
the first time|255216001|410669006|232714002|410669006
a protist
was
identified|7882003
as causing disease.|23981006|64572001

For this
and
later discoveries,|260383002
he
was
awarded
the 1907 Nobel Prize
for Physiology|1360005
or
Medicine.|410942007

A year later,|258707000|259039008
Carlos Finlay,|262364003
a Cuban doctor treating people|309343006|28995006|125676002
with yellow fever|16541001
in Havana,
provided
strong evidence|260404005|18669006
that mosquitoes|359768004
were
transmitting disease|60117003|64572001
to
and
from humans.|278412004

This work|261041009
followed|367409002
earlier suggestions|264499004
by [Josiah C.

Nott]
(/wiki/Josiah_C._Nott
)
,
[103]
and
work|261041009
by Sir Patrick Manson,|88534007
the "father|66839005
of tropical medicine",|408448007
on the transmission|258150004
of filariasis.[104]|105706003

In April 1894,
a Scottish physician Sir Ronald Ross|309343006
visited
Sir Patrick Manson|88534007
at his house|261770009|257630004
on Queen Anne Street,|257710009|398099009
London.

This visit
was
the start|255395001
of four years|421534005|258707000
of collaboration
and
fervent
research
that
culminated|90571008
in 1898
when
Ross,
who
was
working|261041009
in the Presidency General Hospital|60132005|60132005|285201006
in Calcutta,
proved|277025001
the complete life-cycle|255594003|224130005|44180009
of the malaria parasite
in mosquitoes.|359768004

He thus
proved|277025001
that
the mosquito|359768004
was
the vector|260529001
for malaria|248437004
in humans|278412004
by showing
that certain mosquito species transmit malaria|17162000|359768004|69658003|60117003|248437004
to birds.|387972009

He
isolated malaria parasites|46651001
from the salivary glands|75535001
of mosquitoes|359768004
that
had
fed|238092004
on infected birds.|387972009

For this work,|261041009
Ross
received
the 1902 Nobel Prize
in Medicine.|410942007

After resigning
from the Indian Medical Service,|373655009|118661008
Ross
worked|261041009
at the newly established Liverpool School|263748003|257698009|385645004|257698009
of Tropical Medicine|408448007
and
directed malaria-control efforts|248437004|31509003|19487008
in Egypt,|223511009
Panama,|223696006
Greece|223651004
and
Mauritius.|223541006

The findings|404684003
of Finlay
and
Ross
were
later
confirmed|59156000
by a medical board|74188005
headed|69536005|302548004
by Walter Reed
in 1900.

Its recommendations
were
implemented
by [William C.

Gorgas]|262391001
(/wiki/William_C._Gorgas|262391001
)
in the health measures|263775005|246445000|263775005|367346004
undertaken
during construction|410615009
of the Panama Canal.|223696006|3262009|223696006|257577001

This public-health work|310115006|261041009
saved
the lives|224130005
of thousands
of workers|106541005
and
helped
develop
the methods|260686004|272394005
used|394850002
in future public-health campaigns|310115006
against the disease.[107]|64572001

The first effective treatment|255216001|255403003|276239002|255216001|255403003|416118004|255216001|254648000|276239002|255216001|254648000|416118004|232714002|255403003|276239002|232714002|255403003|416118004|232714002|254648000|276239002|232714002|254648000|416118004
for malaria|248437004
came
from the bark|79470009
of cinchona tree,|30011008|22097005
which
contains|42504009
quinine.|373497008

This tree|22097005
grows
on the slopes
of the Andes,
mainly
in Peru.|223721003

The indigenous peoples|125676002
of Peru|223721003
made
a tincture|422186009
of cinchona to|30011008
control|31509003
fever.|386661006

Its effectiveness|255403003
against malaria|248437004
was
found|404684003
and
the Jesuits
introduced|127487003
the treatment|276239002|416118004
to Europe|223502009
around 1640
;
by 1677,
it
was
included|55919000
in the London Pharmacopoeia
as an antimalarial treatment.|373287002|276239002|373287002|416118004

It
was
not
until 1820
that
the active ingredient,|127489000
quinine,|373497008
was
extracted|62972009
from the bark,|79470009
isolated|46651001
and
named|27468005
by the French chemists Pierre Joseph Pelletier|19434008|106256002
and
Joseph Bienaim?
Caventou.[109][110]

Quinine|373497008
become
the predominant malarial medication|248437004|410942007
until the 1920s,
when
other medications|74964007|410942007
began|255395001
to
be
developed.

In the 1940s,
chloroquine|373468005
replaced|282089006|370124000
quinine|373497008
as the treatment|276239002|416118004
of
both
uncomplicated|263914008
and
severe malaria|24484000|248437004
until resistance supervened,|30714006
first|255216001|232714002
in Southeast Asia|223585008
and
South America|223504005
in the 1950s
and
then globally
in the 1980s.

Artemisinins,|407745009
discovered
by Chinese scientist Tu Youyou|297876005|308027003|415758003|33897005|308027003|415758003
in the 1970s
from the plant _Artemisia annua_,|31006001|103604009
became
the recommended treatment|276239002|416118004
for _P.|20304007

falciparum_ malaria,|248441000
administered|418283001
in combination|89780004
with other antimalarials|74964007|373287002
as well as
in severe disease.[112]|24484000|64572001

The first pesticide|255216001|59545008|232714002|59545008
used|394850002
for indoor residual spraying|65320000|55573003
was
DDT.

Although
it
was
initially|884001
used|394850002
exclusively to
combat
malaria,|248437004
its use quickly|277889008|419385000
spread|410677005
to agriculture.

In time,|410669006
pest control,|275824000
rather than
disease control,|64572001|31509003
came
to
dominate
DDT use,|277889008|419385000
and
this large-scale agricultural use|255509001|19892000|277889008|255509001|19892000|419385000|255509001|278111002|277889008|255509001|278111002|419385000
led|88488004|236874000
to the evolution
of resistant mosquitoes|30714006|359768004
in many regions.|410673009

The DDT resistance|30714006
shown
by _Anopheles_ mosquitoes|54190007|359768004
can
be
compared
to antibiotic resistance|255631004|30714006
shown
by bacteria.|409822003

During the 1960s,
awareness|312012004
of the negative consequences|260385009|103332005
of its indiscriminate use|35599000|277889008|35599000|419385000
increased|35105006|260366006
,
ultimately
leading|236874000
to bans
on agricultural applications|410618006
of DDT
in many countries|223369002
in the 1970s.

Before DDT,
malaria|248437004
was
successfully
eliminated
or
controlled|31509003
in tropical areas|42798000
like Brazil|223715002
and
Egypt|223511009
by removing|127485006
or
poisoning|75478009
the breeding grounds
of the mosquitoes|359768004
or
the aquatic habitats
of the larva stages,|261612004
for example
by applying|410618006|417924000
the highly toxic arsenic compound Paris Green|75540009|23217006|11589006
to places|257557008
with standing water.[114]|10904000|11713004|10904000|119318008

Malaria vaccines|248437004|398827000
have
been
an elusive goal|410518001
of research.

The first promising studies|255216001|110465008|255216001|224699009|232714002|110465008|232714002|224699009
demonstrating
the potential|30207005
for a malaria vaccine|248437004|398827000
were
performed|398166005
in 1967
by immunizing mice|447612001|447482001
with live, radiation-attenuated sporozoites,|419749002|30821001|24588000|103545008|419749002|82107009|24588000|103545008|419749002|108290001|24588000|103545008
which
provided
significant protection|386134007
to the mice|447612001|447482001
upon subsequent injection|255260001|28289002|255260001|385218009|255260001|129326001
with normal, viable sporozoites.|17621005|263927007|103545008|258744000|263927007|103545008

Since
the 1970s,
there
has
been
a considerable effort to|19487008
develop
similar vaccination strategies
within humans.[115]|278412004

Malaria|248437004
is
not just
a disease commonly|64572001
associated|47429007
with poverty|11403006
:
some evidence|18669006
suggests
that
it
is
also
a cause|134198009
of poverty|11403006
and
a major hindrance|255603008
to economic development.|278923009

Tropical regions|410673009
are
affected|247591002|248448006
most|4757001
;
however,
malaria's furthest extent|248437004|46053002|255590007
reaches|282679008
into some temperate zones
with extreme seasonal changes.|12565001|21864008|243326001|12565001|21864008|263703002

The disease|64572001
has
been
associated|47429007
with major negative economic effects|255603008|260385009|253861007
on regions|410673009
where it
is
widespread.|85333001

During the late 19th|260383002
and
early 20th centuries,|264499004
it
was
a major factor|255603008
in the slow economic development|419443000|278923009
of the American southern states.[118]|398070004

A comparison
of average
per capita GDP|69536005|57858007
in 1995,
adjusted|410617001
for parity|118212000
of purchasing power,|33300005
between countries|223369002
with malaria|248437004
and
countries|223369002
without malaria|248437004
gives|419582001
a fivefold difference|263735002
($1,526 USD|260305007
versus
$8,268 USD
).

In countries|223369002
where malaria|248437004
is
common, average|72906007
per capita GDP|69536005|57858007
has
risen
(
between 1965
and
1990
)
only 0.4%|50607009|420295001
per year,|258707000|259039008
compared
to 2.4%|260306008
per year|258707000|259039008
in other countries.[119]|74964007|223369002

Poverty|11403006
can
increase|260366006
the risk|30207005
of malaria,|248437004
since
those
in poverty|11403006
do
not
have
the financial capacities to
prevent
or
treat|395077000
the disease.|64572001

In its entirety,|255503000|260232004
the economic impact|134293005
of malaria|248437004
has
been
estimated|414135002
to
cost
Africa $12 billion USD|223498002
every year.|258707000|259039008

The economic impact|134293005
includes|55919000
costs
of health care,|263775005
working|261041009
days|258703001
lost
due to sickness,|39104002
days|258703001
lost
in education,|266981003|409073007
decreased productivity|1250004|260400001|260371004
due to brain damage|2470005
from cerebral malaria,|53622003
and
loss
of investment
and
tourism.

The disease|64572001
has
a heavy burden|410712002
in some countries,|223369002
where
it
may
be
responsible|394851003
for 30?50%
of hospital admissions,|32485007
up to 50%
of outpatient visits,|373864002
and
up to 40%|259031006
of public health spending.[121]|310115006

Cerebral malaria|53622003
is
one|421379005
of the leading causes|236874000|134198009
of neurological disabilities|1199008|21134002
in African children.|413464008|410601007|413464008|160499008

Studies|110465008|224699009

beyond the immediate effects|88694003|253861007|49499008|253861007
of the disease.[122]|64572001

Sophisticated counterfeits
have
been
found|404684003
in several Asian countries|261028005|223571003
such as Cambodia,|223588005
[123] China,|223581004
[124] Indonesia,|223589002
Laos,|223590006
Thailand,|223594002
and
Vietnam,|223595001
and
are
an important cause|134198009
of avoidable death|419620001|268923008
in those countries.|223369002

The
WHO
said|66049007
that studies|110465008|224699009
indicate|410535002
that
up to 40%|259031006
of artesunate-based malaria medications|432555000|248437004|410942007|432555000|418836005|248437004|410942007
are
counterfeit,
especially
in the Greater Mekong region|263768009|410673009
and
have
established|263748003|385645004
a rapid alert system to|255358001|248221007|246333005
enable|225791005
information
about counterfeit drugs to|410942007
be
rapidly|418694008
reported|229059009|223458004
to the relevant authorities
in participating countries.|223369002

There
is
no reliable way
for doctors|309343006
or
lay people to|125676002
detect|260373001
counterfeit drugs|410942007
without
help
from a laboratory.|261904005

Companies
are
attempting
to
combat
the persistence|130965009
of counterfeit drugs|410942007
by
using|260676000
new technology to|7147002
provide
security
from source|260753009
to distribution.[127]|255464007

Another clinical|58147004
and
public health concern|310115006
is
the proliferation|30217000
of substandard antimalarial medicines|373287002|410942007
resulting|42752001
from inappropriate concentration|82742001
of ingredients,
contamination
with other drugs|74964007|410942007
or
toxic impurities,
poor quality ingredients,|11403006|263496004|255351007|263496004
poor stability|11403006|58158008|255351007|58158008
and
inadequate packaging.|71978007

A 2012 study|110465008|224699009
demonstrated
that roughly one-third|421379005|70905002
of antimalarial medications|373287002|410942007
in Southeast Asia|223585008
and
Sub-Saharan Africa failed chemical analysis,|409988000|441900009|272389005
packaging
analysis,|272389005
or
were
falsified.[1]

Throughout history,|392521001
the contraction|78558002
of malaria|248437004
has
played|300776002
a prominent role|4657009
in the fates|399166001
of government rulers,|102304005
nation-states,|398070004
military personnel,|302314004
and
military actions.|302314004|129264002

In 1910,
Nobel Prize
in Medicine-winner Ronald Ross|410942007
(
himself a malaria survivor|248437004
)
,
published
a book|278212002
titled
_
The Prevention|169443000
of Malaria_|248437004
that
included|55919000
a chapter
titled "
The Prevention|169443000
of Malaria|248437004
in War."
The chapter's author,|308004006
Colonel C.

H.|89177007|258322007|286551008

Melville,
Professor
of Hygiene|284779002
at Royal Army Medical College|74188005|224864007
in London,
addressed|397635003
the prominent role|4657009
that malaria|248437004
has
historically
played|300776002
during wars
:
"
The history|392521001
of malaria|248437004
in war
might
almost
be
taken|419652001
to
be
the history|392521001
of war
itself,
certainly
the history|392521001
of war
in the Christian era.|276116000|160549006

...

It
is
probably
the case|398241000
that many|260396001
of the so-called camp fevers,|223528007|39111003
and
probably also
a considerable proportion|8212001
of the camp dysentery,|111939009
of the wars
of the sixteenth,
seventeenth
and
eighteenth centuries
were
malarial|248437004
in origin."[130]|255395001

Significant financial investments|386134007
have
been
made
to
procure
existing
and
create
new anti-malarial agents.|7147002|373287002|260872001

During World War I|42146005|22971001
and
World War II,
inconsistent supplies|260380004|425398004
of the natural anti-malaria drugs cinchona bark|510009|373287002|410942007|30011008|79470009
and
quinine|373497008
prompted
substantial funding
into research and development|278923009
of other drugs|74964007|410942007
and
vaccines.|398827000

American military organizations|302314004|21139007
conducting|844005
such research initiatives|247756008
include|55919000
the Navy Medical Research Center,|288565001
Walter Reed Army Institute|385437003
of Research,
and

)
of the
US Armed Forces.[131]|302314004|223357005

Additionally,
initiatives|247756008
have
been
founded
such as Malaria Control in War Areas (MCWA),|248437004|31509003|42798000
established|263748003|385645004
in 1942,
and
its successor,
the Communicable Disease Center|191415002|26216008
(now
known|36692007
as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention,|26216008|64572001|31509003|169443000
or
CDC
)
established|263748003|385645004
in 1946.

According to the CDC,
MCWA "
was
established|263748003|385645004
to
control|31509003
malaria|248437004
around military training bases|302314004|118629009|302314004|118629009|418836005
in the southern United States|223688001
and
its territories,|398070004
where malaria|248437004
was
still problematic".[132]

Several notable attempts|261028005
are
being
made to
eliminate
the parasite|37763007
from sections|62083003|118630004
of the world,
or
to
eradicate
it worldwide.

In 2006,
the organization Malaria|21139007|248437004
No More|242762006
set
a public goal|410518001
of eliminating malaria|248437004
from Africa|223498002
by 2015,
and
the organization|21139007
plans|312011006|52713000|397943006
to
dissolve|421682005
if
that goal|410518001
is
accomplished.

Several malaria vaccines|261028005|248437004|398827000
are
in clinical trials,|110465008
which
are
intended|361269008
to
provide
protection
for children|410601007|160499008
in endemic areas|42798000
and
reduce|260400001
the speed
of transmission|258150004
of the disease.|64572001

As of 2012,
The Global Fund|60132005
to Fight AIDS,|248005005|62479008
Tuberculosis|371569005
and
Malaria|248437004
has
distributed
230 million insecticide-treated nets|33278000|28995006|255442003
intended|361269008
to
stop|422117008
mosquito-born transmission|359768004|258150004
of malaria.|248437004

The U.S.-based Clinton Foundation|223688001|57195005|223688001|418836005|57195005
has
worked|261041009
to
manage|119270007
demand
and
stabilize|409051000
prices
in the artemisinin market.|407745009|284440009

Other efforts,|74964007|19487008
such as the Malaria Atlas|248437004|14806007
Project
focus|87017008|363702006
on analysing climate
and
weather information
required
to accurately
predict
the
spread|410677005
of malaria|248437004
based|418836005
on the availability|103328004
of habitat
of malaria-carrying parasites.[80]|288345009

Malaria|248437004
has
been
successfully
eliminated
or
greatly
reduced|260400001
in certain areas.|17162000|42798000

Malaria|248437004
was
once
common|72906007
in the United States|223688001
and
southern Europe,|223502009
but
vector control programs,|275824000
in conjunction with the monitoring|302805002
and
treatment|276239002|416118004
of infected humans,|278412004
eliminated
it
from those regions.|410673009

Several factors|261028005
contributed
,
such as the draining|32712000
of wetland breeding grounds
for agriculture
and
other changes|74964007|243326001|74964007|263703002
in water management practices,|11713004|413454004|11713004|119270007|119318008|413454004|119318008|119270007
and
advances|86005002
in sanitation,
including|55919000
greater use|263768009|277889008|263768009|419385000
of glass|32039001
windows|224755008
and
screens|20135006|360156006
in dwellings.|261770009

Malaria|248437004
was
eliminated
from most parts|260726005
of the USA|223688001
in the early 20th century|264499004
by such methods,|260686004|272394005
and
the use|277889008|419385000
of the pesticide DDT|59545008
and
other means|74964007|255586005
eliminated
it
from the remaining pockets
in the South
in the 1950s.

by the Global Malaria Eradication program|60132005|248437004
in 1955,
involving|248448006
:
vector control|275824000
through the use|277889008|419385000
of DDT
and
IRS
;
regular collection|17854005
of blood smears|87612001|119273009
from the population to|385436007|389109008
identify|7882003
existing malaria cases|248437004|398241000|248437004|413769002
;
and
providing chemotherapy|416608005|367336001
to all affected individuals.|247591002|125676002|247591002|385435006|248448006|125676002|248448006|385435006

Bhutan|223599007
is
pursuing
an aggressive malaria elimination strategy,|61372001|248437004|63911002|248437004|63911002
and
has
achieved
a 98.7% decline
in microscopy-confirmed cases|117259009|59156000|398241000|117259009|59156000|413769002
from 1994
to 2010.

In addition|260364009
to vector control techniques|275824000|272394005
such as IRS
in high-risk areas|15508007|42798000
and
thorough distribution|255464007

factors
such as economic development|278923009
and
increasing access|260369004|260507000
to health services|263775005|224930009

Over 400 proteins|88878007
have
been
found|404684003
to
be
produced
by apicoplasts
and
these
are
now
being
investigated|116698004
as possible targets|371930009|60022001
for novel anti-malarial drugs.[148]|7147002|373287002|410942007

With the onset|77374008
of drug-resistant _Plasmodium_ parasites,|333032003|30714006|34706006
new strategies|7147002
are
being
developed to
combat
the widespread disease.|85333001|64572001

One|421379005
such approach
lies|40199007|255576009
in the introduction|107733003
of synthetic pyridoxal-amino acid adducts,|430926008|52518006
which
are
taken|419652001
up
by the parasite|37763007
and
ultimately
interfere|78235001
with its ability to|371150009
create
several essential B-vitamins.|261028005|34325006|87708000

Antimalarial drugs|373287002
utilising
synthetic metal-based complexes|425620007|103360007|425620007|418836005|103360007
are
attracting
research interest.[151][152]|225469004

A non-chemical vector control strategy|441900009|275824000
involves|248448006
genetic manipulation|3950001|129408000|255395001|129408000
of malaria mosquitoes.|248437004|359768004

Advances|86005002
in genetic engineering technologies|3950001|106269003|255395001|106269003
make
it possible to|371930009|60022001
introduce|127487003
foreign DNA|24851008
into the mosquito genome|359768004|18470003
and
either
decrease|260400001|260370003
the lifespan
of the mosquito,|359768004
or
make
it more resistant|242762006|30714006
to the malaria parasite.

Sterile insect technique|261029002|106763003|272394005|15296000|106763003|272394005
is
a genetic control method|13197004
whereby large numbers|255509001|410680006|255509001|410681005
of sterile males mosquitoes|261029002|248153007|359768004|15296000|248153007|359768004
are
reared
and
released.|68776005|129299003

Mating
with wild females|262290003|248152002
reduces|260400001
the wild population|262290003|385436007|262290003|389109008
in the subsequent generation|255260001
;
repeated releases eventually|27582007|115956009
eliminate
the target population.[49]|385436007|389109008

Nearly 200 parasitic _Plasmodium_ species|372332005
have
been
identified|7882003
that
infect
birds,|387972009
reptiles,|107241004
and
other mammals,|74964007|387976007
[153]
and
about 30 species naturally|69658003
infect
non-human primates.|278412004|388073004

Some
of the malaria parasites
that
affect|4065008
non-human primates (NHP)|278412004|388073004
serve
as model organisms|410653004
for human malarial parasites,|278412004
such as _[P.|20304007

Diagnostic techniques|103693007
used|394850002
to
detect|260373001
parasites|37763007
in NHP
are
similar
to those
employed|224363007
for humans.|278412004

Avian malaria primarily|1498006
affects|4065008
species|69658003
of the order Passeriformes,|107142003
and
poses
a substantial threat
to birds|387972009
of Hawaii,|224049006
the Galapagos,
and
other archipelagoes.|74964007

The parasite _[P.|37763007

relictum]
(/wiki/Plasmodium_relictum|91350007
)
_
is
known to|36692007
play|300776002
a role
in limiting|255469002
the distribution|255464007
and
abundance
of endemic Hawaiian birds.|20140003|387972009

Global warming|60132005
is
expected to
increase|260366006
the prevalence
and
global distribution|60132005|255464007
of avian malaria,|1498006
as
elevated temperatures|386661006
provide
optimal conditions|260905004
for parasite reproduction.[156]|37763007|263767004
