(

)
is
an infection
caused|23981006|134198009
by _Penicillium marneffei_.[1]|71825007

It
is
a dimorphic fungus.[2][3]|416226001

Once considered rare,|84638005|103356009
its occurrence|272120004
has
increased|35105006|260366006
due to AIDS.|62479008

It
is
now
the third most common opportunistic infection|70905002|72906007|61274003
(
after extrapulmonary tuberculosis|423997002
and
cryptococcosis|42386007
in HIV-positive individuals|402916007|125676002|402916007|385435006
within the endemic area|42798000
of Southeast Asia.|223585008

Diagnosis|439401001
is
usually
made
by identification|286672002|7882003
of the fungi|414561005
from clinical specimens.|58147004|123038009

Biopsies|86273004
of skin lesions,|95324001
lymph nodes,|59441001
and
bone marrow|279729006
demonstrate
the presence|386397008
of organisms|410653004
on histopathology.|394597005

The most common symptoms|4757001|72906007
are
fever,|386661006
skin lesions,|95324001
anemia,|271737000
generalized lymphadenopathy,|274741002
and
hepatomegaly.|80515008

_Penicillium marneffei_|71825007
demonstrates
in vitro susceptibility|76522002|118588007
to multiple antifungal agents|260396001|373219008
including|55919000
ketoconazole,|387216007
itraconazole,|387532006
[4] miconazole,|260308009|372738006
flucytosine,|387155003
and
amphotericin B.|77703004

Without treatment patients|276239002|116154003|416118004|116154003
have
a poor prognosis|170969009
;
death|419620001|268923008
occur|272120004
by liver failure|59927004
as the fungus|414561005
releases|115956009
toxins|80917008
in the bloodstream.

The elevation|103720008|255456001
of liver enzyme|259670004
in the blood|87612001|119273009
helps
to
establish|263748003
a diagnosis.|439401001
