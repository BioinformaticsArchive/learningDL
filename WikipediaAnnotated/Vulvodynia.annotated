*Vulvodynia|238968009
*
*
is
a chronic pain syndrome|373621006
that
affects|4065008
the vulvar area|45292006|42798000
and
often|70232002
occurs|272120004
without an identifiable cause|7882003|134198009
or
visible pathology[1]|24054004|394595002
categorized
in the ICD-9 group 625?specifically ICD-9 625.7,|70199000|261586004|70199000|160481000|70199000|389109008
which
is
for pain|22253000
and
other disorders|74964007|64572001
of the female genital organs.|409970008

It
refers|439980006
to pain|22253000
of the vulva|45292006|265796001
unexplained
by vulvar|45292006
or
vaginal infection|237091009
or
skin disease.[3]|95320005

The term "vulvodynia" simply|238968009
refers|439980006
to "vulvar pain",|162145001
and
does
not
imply
a specific cause.[4]|69658003|23981006|69658003|134198009

Pain|22253000
is
the most notable symptom|4757001
of vulvodynia,|238968009
and
can
be
characterized
as a burning,|90673000|62404004
stinging|72587008
,
irritation|257553007
or
sharp pain|8708008
that
occurs|272120004
in the vulva,|45292006|265796001
including|55919000
the labia|39117004
and
entrance|89103007
to the vagina.|76784001|181441005

It
may
be
constant, intermittent|7087005
or
happen only
when
the vulva|45292006|265796001
is
touched,|386476006|52962008|397624008
but
vulvodynia|238968009
is
usually
defined
as lasting
for years.|258707000

Symptoms
may
occur|272120004
in one place|421379005|257557008|421379005|421066005
or
the entire vulvar area.|265796001|42798000

It
can
occur|272120004
during
or
after sexual activity,|365952006
when
tampons|79287008
are
inserted|257867005
,
or
when
prolonged pressure|255224006|279046003|255224006|13543005|255224006|257893003
is
applied|410618006
to the vulva,|45292006|265796001
such as
during sitting,|33586001
bike riding,|70224005
or
horseback riding.|47517001

Some cases|398241000|413769002
of vulvodynia|238968009
are
idiopathic|54690008
where no particular cause|134198009
can
be
determined.

may
extend|255590007

Vulvar Vestibulitis Syndrome (VVS)|30833006
is
the most common subtype|4757001|72906007|260837004
of vulvodynia|238968009
that
affects|4065008
premenopausal women ?|224526002
the syndrome
has
been
cited
as affecting|247591002|248448006
about 10%?15%
of women|224526002
seeking
gynecological care.[6]|394586005

A wide variety|90522003
of possible causes|371930009|134198009|60022001|134198009
and
treatments|276239002
for vulvodynia|238968009
are
currently|15240007
being
explored.

Moreover,
there
are
probably several causes|134198009
of vulvodynia,|238968009
and
some
may
be
individual|125676002|385435006
to the patient.|116154003

Possible causes|371930009|134198009|60022001|134198009
include|55919000
:
genetic predisposition|47708004
to inflammation,|257552002
[7] allergy|408439002|421961002
or
other sensitivity|74964007|35209006|74964007|365705006
(
for example
:
oxalates|430774002
in the urine|78014005
)
,
an autoimmune disorder|85828009
similar
to lupus erythematosus|200936003
or
to eczema|281104002
or
to lichen sclerosus,|25674000
infection
(
e.g.
,
yeast infections,|58296003|412534006|411818003
bacterial vaginosis,|419760006
HPV|9482002
)
,

in the vaginal area.|76784001|42798000|42798000

Some cases|398241000|413769002
seem
to
be
negative outcomes|260385009|394617004
of genital surgery,|263767004|83578000
such as a labiectomy.

Pelvic floor dysfunction|87770006|386585008|361300007|386585008
may
be
the underlying cause|134198009
of some women's pain.|224526002|22253000

The condition|260905004
is
one|421379005
of exclusion
and
other vulvovaginal problems|74964007|55607006
should
be
ruled|10828004
out.|255529000

The diagnosis|439401001
is
based|418836005
on the typical complaints|409586006
of the patient,|116154003
essentially normal physical findings,|17621005|72670004|258744000|72670004
and
the absence|2667000|418560003
of identifiable causes|7882003|134198009
per the differential diagnosis.|47965005

A cotton ?swab test?|51627003|257261003|269814003|51627003|257261003|51627003|257261003|272393004|51627003|285570007|269814003|51627003|285570007|51627003|285570007|272393004|51627003|408098004|269814003|51627003|408098004|51627003|408098004|272393004|91299008|257261003|269814003|91299008|257261003|91299008|257261003|272393004|91299008|285570007|269814003|91299008|285570007|91299008|285570007|272393004|91299008|408098004|269814003|91299008|408098004|91299008|408098004|272393004|54000004|257261003|269814003|54000004|257261003|54000004|257261003|272393004|54000004|285570007|269814003|54000004|285570007|54000004|285570007|272393004|54000004|408098004|269814003|54000004|408098004|54000004|408098004|272393004|256246007|257261003|269814003|256246007|257261003|256246007|257261003|272393004|256246007|285570007|269814003|256246007|285570007|256246007|285570007|272393004|256246007|408098004|269814003|256246007|408098004|256246007|408098004|272393004
is
used to|394850002
delineate
the areas|42798000
of pain|22253000
and
categorize
their severity.|272141005

Patients often|116154003|70232002
will
describe
the touch|386476006|52962008|397624008
of a cotton ball|51627003|91299008|54000004|256246007
as
extremely painful,|22253000
like the scraping|56757003
of a knife.|17472008

Many sufferers|260396001
will
see|281004000
several doctors|261028005|309343006
before a correct diagnosis|439401001
is
made.

Many gynecologists|260396001|83685006
are
not familiar|36692007
with this family|35359004
of conditions,|260905004
but
awareness|312012004
has
spread|410677005
with time.|410669006

Sufferers
are
also often hesitant to|70232002
seek
treatment|276239002|416118004
for chronic vulvar pain,|82423001|45292006|90734009|162145001
especially
since
many women|260396001|224526002
begin|255395001
experiencing symptoms
around the same time|262126009|410669006
they
become
sexually active.|228453005

Moreover,
the absence|2667000|418560003
of any visible symptoms means|24054004|255586005
that
before
being
successfully
diagnosed|439401001
many patients|116154003
are
told
that
the pain|22253000
is
"
in their head".|69536005|302548004

There
is
no uniform treatment approach|27617004|276239002|27617004|416118004
for vulvodynia|238968009
or
vulvar vestibulitis.|30833006

Women|224526002
have
shown
improved symptoms|385425000|3442003
from a variety
of treatments.|276239002

Some
find
100% relief|224978009
from particular treatments,|276239002
while
others|74964007
may
experience
only temporary|50607009|14803004|420295001|14803004
or
partial relief.|255609007|224978009

Responses
to the various|256220008
and
many treatments|260396001|276239002
being
tried
are
highly variable,|75540009|255372005
with many patients often|116154003|70232002
trying
several treatments|261028005|276239002
over the course|288524001
of their diagnosis|439401001
depending
upon their levels|258395000
of relief,|224978009
the preferred method|225773000|260686004|225773000|272394005
(s)
of their doctor|309343006
(s|288495006
)
,
and
the affordability
of these treatments|276239002
;
many treatments|260396001|276239002
are
still experimental
and
often|70232002
not
covered|255334000
by health insurance ?|263775005
or
the particular doctor|309343006
using|260676000
them
does
not
take|419652001
insurance.

Treatments|276239002
include|55919000
:

Like many other people|74964007|125676002
suffering
from pain disorders,|22253000|64572001
those
afflicted
with vulvodynia|238968009
may
often|70232002
be
impacted|134293005
by the frustration|224973000
of finding|404684003
a diagnosis,|439401001
subsequently
confronted
with an area|42798000
of medicine|410942007
that
is
still
in relative infancy.|125677006|3658006|29920004|3658006

The cause|134198009
is
still unknown|261665006
and
treatment success|276239002|385669000|416118004|385669000
varies.

Therefore,
many
become frustrated|224973000
and
sometimes
depressed|366979004
with a lower quality|261122009|263496004
of life._[citation|224130005
