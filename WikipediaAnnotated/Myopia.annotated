A condition|260905004
of the eye|81745001|244486005
where the light|56242006|371268001
that
comes
in
does
not directly focus|87017008|363702006
on the retina|5665001|181171005
but
in front|255549009
of it.

This
causes|134198009
the image
that one sees|421379005|281004000
when
looking|386548000
at a distant object to|261007001|260787004
be
out of focus|87017008|363702006

in focus|87017008|363702006
when
looking|386548000
at a close object.|29179001|260787004

Eye care professionals most commonly correct myopia|225363004|57190000
through the use|277889008|419385000
of corrective lenses,|78076003|181169005
such as glasses|50121007
or
contact lenses.|57368009

It
may
also
be
corrected|370975003
by refractive surgery,|373391005|420708009
though
there
are
cases|398241000|413769002
of associated side effects.|47429007

The corrective lenses|78076003|181169005

Myopia|57190000
has
been
classified|73504009
in various manners.[3][4][5]|256220008

Borish
and
Duke-Elder classified myopia|15737008|73504009|57190000|422164008|73504009|57190000
by cause|134198009

[4][5]|264676006

Elevation|103720008|255456001
of blood-glucose levels|365812005
can
also
cause|23981006|134198009
edema|423666004
(swelling|423666004|442672001
)
of the crystalline lens|78076003
(hyperphacosorbitomyopicosis

of sorbitol|412513004
(sugar alcohol accumulating|116267009
in the lens.|78076003|181169005

This edema often|423666004|70232002
causes|134198009
temporary myopia|14803004|57190000
(nearsightedness|57190000
).

A common sign|72906007|72670004
of hyperphacosorbitomyopicosis
is
blurring|246636008
of distance vision|246132006|281004000
while
near vision|57190000|277752003

Myopia,|57190000
which
is
measured|258104002
in diopters|259047008|259048003|259049006
by the strength|260404005
or
optical power|281004000|33300005
of a corrective lens|78076003|181169005

Myopia|57190000
presents|52101004|246105001
with blurry distance vision,|246636008|246132006
but
generally
gives|419582001
good near vision.|20572008|281004000

In high myopia,|34187009
even near vision|281004000
is
affected|247591002|248448006

A diagnosis|439401001
of myopia|57190000
is
typically
confirmed|59156000
during an eye examination|36228007
by an ophthalmologist,|422234006
optometrist|28229004

orthoptist.|159027001

Frequently|70232002
an autorefractor|397250001

Some clinicians
and
researchers
recommend
plus power|33300005
(convex
)
lenses|78076003|181169005
in the form|246176004
of reading glasses|50360004|50121007
when
engaged|54986009
in close work|29179001|261041009
or
reading|50360004
instead of
using|260676000
single focal concave lens|125681006|87017008|78076003|125681006|87017008|181169005|50607009|87017008|78076003|50607009|87017008|181169005

The reasoning
behind a convex lens's possible effectiveness|78076003|371930009|255403003|78076003|60022001|255403003|181169005|371930009|255403003|181169005|60022001|255403003
in preventing myopia|57190000|116699007|57190000
is
simple to|13673007
understand|66216009
:
Convex lenses' refractive property|78076003|370130000|181169005|370130000
of converging light|56242006|371268001
are
used|394850002
in reading|50360004
glasses|50121007
to
help
reduce|260400001
the accommodation|251776000
needed|410525008|103325001
when
reading|50360004
and
doing
close work.|29179001|261041009

Although
accommodation|251776000
is
irrelevant
in Medina's quantitative model|30766002
of myopia,|57190000
it
reaches|282679008
the same conclusion.|262126009

The model
teaches|409073007|264939006
a very simple method to|260358002|13673007|260686004|260358002|13673007|272394005
prevent
myopia.[30]|57190000

For people|125676002
with presbyopia,|41256004
whose eyes' lenses|78076003
can
not
accommodate
enough
for very near focus,|260358002|87017008|260358002|363702006
reading|50360004
glasses|50121007
help
converge
the light|56242006|371268001
before
it
enters|417985001
the eye to|81745001|244486005
complement|20823009
the refractive power|251718005
of the eye lens,|78076003
so
near|277752003
objects|260787004
focus clearly|87017008|363702006
on the retina.|5665001|181171005

By reducing|260400001
the focusing effort|251776000|19487008
needed|410525008|103325001
(accommodation|251776000
)
,
reading|50360004
glasses|50121007
or
convex lenses essentially|78076003|181169005
relax|15166001
the focusing ciliary muscles|251776000|9668006
and
may
consequently
reduce|260400001
chances
of developing myopia.|57190000

Inexpensive nonprescription reading glasses|80288002|50360004|50121007
are
commonly
sold
in drug stores|410942007|440276004
and
dollar stores.|284175004|440276004

Alternatively,
reading|50360004
glasses|50121007
fitted|91175000|102499006
by optometrists|28229004
have
a wider range|90522003
of styles
and
lens choices.[33]|78076003|264667004|181169005|264667004

A recent Malaysian study|6493001|110465008|6493001|224699009
reported|229059009|223458004
in _New Scientist_[34] suggested undercorrection|7147002|308027003

of myopia.|57190000

However,
the reliability
of these data
has
been
called
into question.|42425007

Many myopia treatment studies|260396001|57190000|276239002
suffer
from any
of a number|410680006|410681005
of design drawbacks
:
small numbers,|255507004|410680006|255507004|410681005

Pirenzepine eyedrops|398669004|385125006

a limited effect|255469002|253861007
on retarding myopic progression|6155003
in a recent, placebo-controlled, double-blind, prospective-controlled study.[37]|6493001|31509003|1305003|110465008|6493001|31509003|1305003|224699009|6493001|31509003|1305003|110465008|6493001|31509003|1305003|224699009

Researchers
at the University of Cambridge|224871002
have
found|404684003
that
a lack|41277001
of outdoor
play|300776002

be
linked
to myopia.[38]|57190000|264670000

Eyeglasses,|50121007
contact lenses,|57368009
and
refractive surgery|373391005|420708009

the primary options to|63161005|261424001
treat|395077000
the visual symptoms|162274004
of those with myopia.|20401003|57190000|421463005|57190000

an alternative
to glasses|50121007
or
contact lenses|57368009
for myopics
for whom laser surgery|35631009
is
not
an option.

Orthokeratology|414980000
is
the practice
of
using|260676000
special rigid contact lenses to|67995009|313011004
flatten
the cornea to|28726007|181162001
reduce|260400001
myopia.|57190000

Occasionally,
pinhole glasses|257492003|50121007
are

their adverse effects

The best way to
avoid
needing new lenses|103325001|7147002|78076003|103325001|7147002|181169005
is
by reducing|260400001
the amount|107651007
of near work,|277752003|261041009
which
forces
the eyes|81745001
into a continuous near-focusing position|255238004|251776000|246449006
that eventually
causes|134198009
or
increases|260366006
myopia,|57190000
by taking frequent breaks|70232002
from near work,|277752003|261041009
and
by only wearing glasses|50607009|50121007|420295001|50121007
when
they
are
needed._[citation|410525008|103325001

can
also
be
worn
during near|277752003
work|261041009
to
decrease|260400001|260370003
the strain|48532005|276768000
on the eye,|81745001|244486005
especially
when
already
wearing
corrective lenses,|78076003|181169005

For people|125676002
with a high degree|75540009|258395000|75540009|246173007|371879000|258395000|371879000|246173007
of myopia,|57190000
very strong eyeglass prescriptions|260358002|260404005|183131009
are
needed|410525008|103325001
to correct
the focus error.|87017008|363702006

However,
strong eyeglass prescriptions|260404005|183131009
have
a negative side effect|260385009
in that
off-axis viewing|39976000|246516004|388282002|246516004
of objects away|260787004
from the center|26216008
of the lens|78076003|181169005
results|394617004
in prismatic movement|255324009
and
separation|16640008|160788005
of colors,|263714004
known|36692007
as chromatic aberration.|263714004|260980007

This prismatic distortion|20967005
is
visible|24054004
to the wearer
as color fringes|263714004
around strongly contrasting colors.|263543005|263714004

The fringes
move|302000008|384598002|370125004
around
as
the wearer's gaze|246772007
through the lenses|78076003|181169005
changes|243326001|263703002
,
and
the prismatic shifting reverses|9546005|35174006
on
either
side,|182353008
above,|261183002
and
below the exact center|26216008
of the lenses.|78076003|181169005

Color fringing|263714004
can
make

painting difficult|36864000|52925006
for users
of strong eyeglass prescriptions.|260404005|183131009

Strongly nearsighted wearers|57190000
of contact lenses|57368009
do
not
experience
chromatic aberration|263714004|260980007
because
the lens|78076003|181169005
moves|302000008
with the cornea|28726007|181162001
and
always stays

The American Optometric Association's Clinical Practice Guidelines|263534001|58147004|272151006|58147004
for Myopia refers|57190000|439980006
to numerous studies|260396001|110465008|260396001|224699009
which
indicated|410535002
the effectiveness|255403003
of bifocal lenses|397285001
and
recommends
it
as
the method|260686004|272394005
for "Myopia Control".|57190000|31509003

In some studies,|110465008|224699009
bifocal|397285001
and
progressive lenses|255314001|78076003|255314001|181169005

More recently,|242762006|6493001
robust studies|110465008|224699009

Scleral reinforcement surgery|18619003|28485005|83578000
is
aimed to
cover|255334000
the thinning posterior pole|29143009|264153007
with a supportive material to|260769002
withstand
intraocular pressure|41633001|252832004|370960006
and
prevent
further progression|46053002|246453008|46053002|246450006
of the posterior staphyloma.|87819007

The strain|48532005|276768000

reduced,|260400001
although
damage|37782003

By stopping|260890000|385654001|422117008
the progression|246453008|246450006

A number|410680006|410681005
of alternative therapies|276239002
exist
including|55919000
eye exercises|225702009
and
relaxation techniques,|284467003
such as the Bates method.|260686004|272394005

However,
the efficacy
of these practices
is
disputed|9182005
by scientists|308027003
and
eye care practitioners.|225363004

A 2005 review
of scientific papers|50833004
on the subject
concluded
that there
was
"
no clear scientific evidence"|263707001|18669006
that eye exercises|225702009
were
effective|255403003|254648000
in treating myopia.[47]|28995006|57190000

In the 1980s
and
1990s,
biofeedback|28150003|61334006
created
a flurry
of interest|225469004
as a possible treatment|371930009|276239002|371930009|416118004|60022001|276239002|60022001|416118004
for myopia.|57190000

A 1997 review
of this biofeedback research concluded "controlled|28150003|31509003|61334006|31509003
studies|110465008|224699009
to
validate
such methods ...|260686004|272394005

have
been
rare|84638005|103356009
and
contradictory."[48] One study|421379005|110465008|421379005|224699009
found|404684003
that myopes
could
improve|385425000|3442003|385633008
their visual acuity|363983007
with biofeedback training,|28150003|118629009|61334006|118629009
but
that
this improvement
was
"instrument-specific"|57134006|69658003
and
did
not
generalise|60132005
to other measures|74964007|246445000|74964007|367346004
or
situations.

In another study,|110465008|224699009
an "improvement"
in visual acuity|363983007
was
found|404684003
,
but
the authors|308004006
concluded
this
could
be
a result|394617004
of subjects
learning|69998004
the task.

Finally,
in an evaluation|386053000
of a training system|118629009|246333005
designed
to
improve|385425000|3442003|385633008
acuity,
"
no significant difference|386134007|263735002
was
found|404684003
between the control|31509003
and
experimental subjects".[51]

The global prevalence|60132005

For myopia,|57190000
Asians|414978006
had
the highest prevalence|75540009|371879000
(18.5%

25.4%
of Americans

In Australia,|223621005
the overall prevalence
of myopia|57190000
(worse|230993007|390772001|231877006

In Brazil,|223715002
a 2005 study|110465008|224699009
estimated|414135002
6.4%|260270000
of Brazilians
between the ages|424144002

of myopia|57190000
or
more,|242762006
compared
with 2.7%|260306008
of the indigenous people|125676002

Another

(13.3%
)
of the students|65853000
in the city|284560003

were
myopic.[70]

A number|410680006|410681005
of studies|110465008|224699009
have
shown
the incidence
of myopia|57190000
increases|260366006
with level|258395000|276625007
of education,|266981003|409073007
[55][61]|264691008
and
many studies[71]|260396001|110465008|264699005|260396001|224699009|264699005
have
shown
a correlation
between myopia|57190000
and
a higher intelligence quotient (IQ).|75540009|165178003|371879000|165178003

A 2008 literature review reported studies|229059009|110465008|229059009|224699009|223458004|110465008|223458004|224699009
in several nations|261028005
have
found|404684003
a relationship|272151006
between myopia|57190000
and
higher IQ|75540009|371879000
and
between myopia|57190000
and
school achievement.|257698009

A common explanation|72906007
for myopia|57190000
is
near-work.|277752003|261041009

Regarding
the relationship|272151006
to IQ,
several explanations|261028005
have
been
proposed.

One|421379005
is
that
the myopic child|410601007|160499008
is
better|3442003
adapted
at reading,|50360004
and
reads|50360004
and
studies|110465008|224699009
more,|242762006
which
increases|260366006
intelligence.|22851009

The reverse explanation
is
that
the intelligent|22851009
and
studious child|110465008|410601007|110465008|160499008|224699009|410601007|224699009|160499008
reads|50360004
more,|242762006
which
causes|134198009
myopia.|57190000

Another
is
that myopic children|410601007|160499008
have
an advantage
at IQ testing|72657008
which
is
near-work|277752003|261041009
because of less eye strain.|276139006|70323002|263796003|70323002

Still
another explanation
is
that pleiotropic gene|67271001
(s)
affect|4065008
the size|277049003
of
both
brain|12738006|258335003
and
eyes simultaneously.|81745001|79970003

According to the two most recent studies,|420797005|6493001|110465008|420797005|6493001|224699009
higher IQ|75540009|371879000
may
be
associated|47429007
with myopia|57190000
in schoolchildren,|160498000
independent of books|278212002
read|50360004
per week.[72]|258705008|259038000

Other personal characteristics,|74964007
such as value systems,|246333005
school achievements,|257698009
time|410669006
spent
in reading|50360004
for pleasure,
language abilities|61909002|371150009
and
time|410669006
spent
in sport activities|415577004
correlated
to the occurrence|272120004
of myopia|57190000
in studies.[73][74][75]|110465008|224699009

Heredity
appears
as an important factor
associated|47429007
with juvenile myopia,|133937008|57190000
with smaller contributions|263796003|255507004
from more near work,|242762006|261041009
higher school achievement|75540009|257698009|371879000|257698009
and
less time|276139006|410669006|263796003|410669006
in sports activity.[76]|415577004

The terms "myopia"|57190000
and
"myopic"
(
or
the common terms "shortsightedness"|72906007|57190000
or
"
shortsighted|57190000
",
respectively
)
have
been
used|394850002
metaphorically to
refer|439980006
to cognitive thinking|88952004
and
decision making|247583006
that
is
narrow|18043004|25659002|134223000
in scope
or
lacking|41277001
in foresight
or
in concern
for wider interests|90522003|225469004
or
for longer-term consequences.|103332005

It
is
often|70232002
used to|394850002
describe
a decision
that
may
be
beneficial
in the present,|52101004|246105001
but
detrimental
in the future,
or
a viewpoint
that
fails
to
consider
anything
outside a very|260358002
narrow|18043004|25659002|134223000
and
limited range.|255469002

Hyperopia,|38101003
the biological opposite|12893009
of myopia,|57190000
may
also
be
used|394850002
metaphorically
for a value system|246333005
or
motivation|106121005
that
exhibits
"
farsighted|38101003
"
or
possibly visionary thinking|60022001|281004000|88952004
and
behavior|844005
;
that
is
,
emphasizing
long-term
interests|225469004
at the apparent expense
of near-term benefit.[78]|277752003

Normally eye development|81745001|278923009|244486005|278923009
is
largely genetically
controlled|31509003
,
but
it
has
been
shown
that
the visual environment|255374006|276339004
is
an important factor
in determining ocular development.|81745001|278923009|281004000|278923009|278923009

Genetically,
linkage studies|110465008|224699009
have
identified|7882003
18 possible loci|371930009|60022001
on 15 different chromosomes|71678009|263735002
that
are
associated|47429007
with myopia,|57190000
but
none|260413007
of these loci
are
part|260726005
of the candidate genes|67271001
that
cause|23981006|134198009
myopia.|57190000

Instead of a simple one-gene locus|13673007|421379005|67271001
controlling|54776003|31509003
the onset|77374008
of myopia,|57190000
a complex interaction|103360007
of many mutated proteins|55446002|88878007
acting
in concert
may
be
the cause.|134198009

Instead of myopia|57190000
being
caused|23981006|134198009
by a defect|6920004
in a structural protein,|304381003
defects|6920004
in the control|31509003
of these structural proteins|304381003
might
be
the actual cause|134198009
of myopia.[79]|57190000

To
induce|16404004
myopia|57190000
in lower|261122009
as well as
higher vertebrates,|75540009|387967000|371879000|387967000
translucent goggles|300828005|272183000
can
be
sutured|408099007|29684008
over the eye,|81745001|244486005
either
before|236874000|421718005
or
after natural eye opening.|510009|81745001|56116003|510009|244486005|56116003

Form-deprived myopia (FDM)|246176004|57190000
induced|16404004
with a diffuser,
like the goggles|272183000
mentioned
,
shows
significant myopic shifts.|386134007|9546005

Anatomically,
the changes|243326001|263703002
in axial length|24422004|410668003
of the eye|81745001|244486005
seem
to
be
the major factor contributing|255603008
to this type|261664005
of myopia.|57190000

Diurnal growth rhythms|30920001
of the eye|81745001|244486005
have
also
been
shown
to
play|300776002
a large part|255509001|260726005
in FDM.

Chemically,|441900009
daytime retinal dopamine levels|28017001|5665001|412383006|258395000|28017001|5665001|32779004|258395000|28017001|103067001|412383006|258395000|28017001|103067001|32779004|258395000
drop|404218003
about 30%.[83]

Normal eyes|17621005|81745001|258744000|81745001
grow
during the day|258703001|259032004
and
shrink
during the night,|2546009
but
occluded eyes|26036001|81745001|263823007|81745001
are
shown
to
grow
both
during the day|258703001|259032004
and
the night.|2546009

Because of this,
FDM
is
a result|394617004
of the lack|41277001
of growth inhibition|61511001|419495008
at night|2546009
rather than
the expected excessive growth|260378005
during the day,|258703001|259032004
when
the actual light deprivation|56242006|371268001
occurred.|272120004

)
in the RPE|41275009|262082006
have
been
shown
to
be
associated|47429007
with FDM.[85]

Dopamine|412383006|32779004
is
a major neurotransmitter|255603008|35069000
in the retina|5665001|181171005
involved|248448006
in signal transmission|258150004
in the visual system.|49549006|281831001

In the retinal inner nuclear layer,|5665001|260521003|84640000|103067001|260521003|84640000
a dopaminergic neuronal network|16257000|47220008
has
been
visualized|255374006
in amacrine cells.|9475001

Also,
retinal dopamine|5665001|412383006|5665001|32779004|103067001|412383006|103067001|32779004
is
involved|248448006
in the regulation
of electrical coupling|18213006|258096005
between horizontal cells|24020000|4421005
and
the retinomotor movement|255324009
of photoreceptor cells.|4421005

Although
FDM-related elongations|272151006|262094002
in axial length|24422004|410668003
and
drops|426684005|404218003
in dopamine levels|412383006|258395000|32779004|258395000
are
significant,|386134007
after
the diffuser
is
removed,|127485006
a complete refraction recovery|255594003|366060000|255594003|252886007
is
seen
within four days|421534005|258703001
in some laboratory mice.|261904005|447612001|261904005|447482001

Although
significant,|386134007
what
is
even more intriguing
is
that
within just two days|420797005|258703001
of diffuser removal,|118292001|128303001
an early rise|264499004
and
eventual normalization
of retinal dopamine levels|5665001|412383006|258395000|5665001|32779004|258395000|103067001|412383006|258395000|103067001|32779004|258395000
in the eye|81745001|244486005
are
seen.

This
suggests
dopamine|412383006|32779004
participates
in visually guided eye growth regulation,|106384005|81745001|106384005|244486005|303479009|81745001|303479009|244486005
and
these fluctuations|16237004
are
not just
a response
to the FDM.[87]

L-Dopa|387086006

been
shown
to
re-establish|228877007|263748003
circadian rhythms|30920001
in animals|387961004

Dopamine,|412383006|32779004
a major metabolite|255603008
of levodopa,|387086006

Because
retinal dopamine levels|5665001|412383006|258395000|5665001|32779004|258395000|103067001|412383006|258395000|103067001|32779004|258395000
are
controlled|31509003
on a circadian pattern,|272135003
intravitreal injection|28289002|385218009|129326001
of L-dopa|387086006
in animals|387961004
that
have
lost dopamine|412383006|32779004
and
circadian rhythms|30920001
has
been
shown
to correct
these patterns,|272135003
especially
in heart rate,|364075005
temperature,|105723007|246508008
and
locomotor activity.|48761009

The occluders
block|26036001|112232007
light completely|56242006|371268001
for the animals,|387961004
which
does
not
allow
them to
establish|263748003
correct circadian rhythms,|30920001
which
leads|88488004|236874000
to dopamine depletion.|412383006|69251000|32779004|69251000

This depletion|69251000
can
be
rectified
with injections|28289002|129326001
of L-dopa|387086006
and
hopefully
contribute
to the recovery
from FDM.

In guinea pigs,|392192009
intraperitoneal injections|81633002
of L-dopa|387086006
have
shown
to
inhibit|61511001
the myopic shift|9546005
associated|47429007
with FDM
and
have
compensated|17275008
to the drop|404218003
in retinal dopamine levels.|5665001|412383006|258395000|5665001|32779004|258395000|103067001|412383006|258395000|103067001|32779004|258395000

In this study specifically,|110465008|224699009
60 animals|387961004
were
used|394850002
and
the L-dopa treatments|387086006|276239002
inhibited|61511001
the myopic shift|9546005
(

due to goggles|272183000

Daily L-dopa|69620002|387086006
(10 mg/kg
)
was
shown
to
increase|260366006
the dopamine content|412383006|276824008|32779004|276824008
in striatum.|31428008

were
positively
correlated
in the normal control eyes,|17621005|31509003|81745001|258744000|31509003|81745001
deprived eyes,|81745001
and
L-dopa-|387086006

The increase|260366006
in retinal dopamine|5665001|412383006|5665001|32779004|103067001|412383006|103067001|32779004
and
subsequent retardation|255260001
of myopia|57190000
may
be
associated|47429007
with the fact
that exogenous L-dopa|261074009|387086006|51352008|387086006
was
converted
into dopamine.|412383006|32779004

This
suggests
retinal dopaminergic function|5665001|16257000|246464006|103067001|16257000|246464006

in guinea pigs.|392192009

The inhibitory effect|61511001|253861007
of L-dopa|387086006
on FDM
may
be
associated|47429007
with the fact
that retinal L-AAAD|5665001|103067001
can
convert
it
into dopamine|412383006|32779004
to balance|249982003|78933003|282295000
the deficiency|260372006|248325000
