*Fibromyalgia|203102006
*
*
(
*
*FM
*
*
or
*
*FMS
*
*
)
is
a medical disorder|74188005|64572001
characterized
by chronic widespread pain|82423001|85333001
and
allodynia,|247404004
a heightened|260365005|260366006
and
painful response to|248240001
pressure.|279046003|13543005|257893003

Fibromyalgia symptoms|203102006
are
not
restricted|263856008
to pain,|22253000
leading|236874000
to the use|277889008|419385000
of the alternative term
*
*fibromyalgia syndrome|203102006
*
*
for the condition.|260905004

Other symptoms|74964007
include|55919000
debilitating
fatigue,|84229001
sleep disturbance,|53888004|44186003
and
joint stiffness.|84445001

Some patients[2] also|116154003
report|229059009|223458004
difficulty|371157007
with swallowing,|54731003|288937009
[3] bowel|260313008|261093006
and
bladder abnormalities,|89837001|276654001|302512001|276654001
[4] numbness|260308009|398026008|260308009|44077006
and
tingling,|162249002
[5]|264706000|264605009
and
cognitive dysfunction.|386806002

Fibromyalgia|203102006
is
frequently comorbid|70232002
with psychiatric conditions|27296002|260905004
such as depression|35489007|366979004|255339005
and
anxiety|48694002|197480006
and
stress-related disorders|262188008|272151006|64572001|262188008|262094002|64572001
such as posttraumatic stress disorder.|47505003

Not
all fibromyalgia patients|203102006|116154003
experience
all associated symptoms.|102483000

Fibromyalgia|203102006
is
estimated to|414135002
affect|4065008
2?4%|260306008
of the population,|385436007|389109008
[7]
with a female|248152002|224526002
to male incidence ratio|248153007|118586006
of approximately 9|26175008

The term "fibromyalgia"|203102006
derives
from new Latin,|7147002
_fibro-_,
meaning|255586005
"fibrous tissues",|34433006
Greek _myo-_,|1451003
"muscle",|91727004
and
Greek _algos-_,|1451003
"pain"|22253000
;
thus
the term literally means "muscle|255586005|91727004
and
connective tissue pain".|181769001|22253000

The brains|12738006
of fibromyalgia patients|203102006|116154003
show
functional|40143009|246464006
and
structural differences|263735002
from those
of healthy individuals,|263775005|125676002|263775005|385435006
but
it
is
unclear
whether
the brain anomalies|12738006|258335003
cause|23981006|134198009
fibromyalgia symptoms|203102006
or
are
the product
of an unknown underlying common cause.|261665006|72906007|134198009

Some research
suggests
that
these brain anomalies|12738006|258335003
may
be
the result|394617004
of childhood stress,|68433009|262188008
or
prolonged|255224006
or
severe stress.[8]|24484000|262188008

Historically,
fibromyalgia|203102006
has
been
considered
either
a musculoskeletal disease|928000
or
neuropsychiatric condition.|260905004

Although
there
is
as yet
no cure
for fibromyalgia,|203102006
some treatments|276239002
have
been
shown
by controlled clinical trials|31509003|110465008
to effectively
reduce|260400001
symptoms,
including|55919000
medications,|410942007
behavioral interventions,|166001
patient education,|311401005
and
exercise.|61686008

The most recent approach|4757001|6493001
of a diagnosis|439401001
of fibromyalgia|203102006
involves|248448006
pain index|22253000|419205000
and
a measure|246445000|272391002
of key symptoms
and
severity.[17]|272141005

Fibromyalgia|203102006
has
been
recognized
as a diagnosable disorder|64572001
by the
US National Institutes of Health|385437003|263775005
and
the American College of Rheumatology.|224864007|394810000|224864007|45440000

Fibromyalgia,|203102006
a central nervous system disorder,|23853001
is
described
as a 'central sensitization syndrome'|26216008|416167002
caused|23981006|134198009
by neurobiological abnormalities|276654001
which
act
to
produce
physiological pain|1360005|22253000
and
cognitive impairments|386806002
as well as
neuro-psychological symptomatology.|60224009

Despite this,
some health care providers
remain
skeptical
about fibromyalgia|203102006
as a disease|64572001
because of a lack|41277001
of abnormalities|276654001
on physical examination|5880005
and
the absence|2667000|418560003
of objective diagnostic tests.[21][22]|410518001|103693007|260224007|103693007

The defining symptoms
of fibromyalgia|203102006
are
chronic widespread pain,|82423001|85333001
fatigue,|84229001
and
heightened pain|260365005|22253000|260366006|22253000
in response
to tactile pressure|52962008|279046003|52962008|13543005|52962008|257893003
(allodynia.|247404004

Other symptoms|74964007
may
include|55919000
tingling|162249002
of the skin,|119325001|39937001|181469002
prolonged muscle spasms,|255224006|45352006
weakness|13791008|260407003
in the limbs,|66019005
nerve pain,|3057000|22253000|256864008|22253000
muscle twitching,|82470000|60238002
palpitations,|80313002
[23] functional bowel disturbances,|264657009|386585008|261093006
[3]|260313008
and
chronic sleep disturbances.[24]|90734009|53888004|90734009|39898005

Many patients|260396001|116154003
experience
cognitive dysfunction[6]|386806002
(
known|36692007
as "fibrofog"
)
,
which
may
be
characterized
by impaired concentration,|60032008
[25] problems|55607006
with short[7][25]|359530003|367450005
and
long-term memory,|247586003
short-term memory consolidation,|69262000|9656002
[7] impaired speed|260379002|40226000
of performance,
[7][25] inability
to multi-task, cognitive|260396001
overload
,
[7][25]
and
diminished attention span.|1250004|6769007

Fibromyalgia|203102006
is
often|70232002
associated|47429007
with anxiety|48694002|197480006
and
depressive symptoms.[7]|394924000

Other symptoms often|74964007|70232002
attributed|246061005
to
fibromyalgia|203102006
that
may
possibly|60022001
be
due to a comorbid disorder|64572001
include|55919000
myofascial pain syndrome,|203102006
also
referred|439980006
to
as
chronic myofascial pain,|82423001
diffuse non-dermatomal paresthesias,|19648000|9611009|91019004|19648000|244023005|91019004
functional bowel disturbances|386585008|261093006
and
irritable bowel syndrome,|10743008
genitourinary symptoms|267062003
and
interstitial cystitis,|111409009|197834003
dermatological disorders,|95320005
headaches,|25064002
myoclonic twitches,|60238002
and
symptomatic hypoglycemia.|264931009|271327008

Although
fibromyalgia|203102006
is
classified|73504009
based|418836005
on the presence|386397008
of chronic widespread pain,|82423001|85333001
pain|22253000
may
also
be
localized|255471002
in areas|42798000
such as the shoulders,|16982005
neck,|45048000|302550007
low back,|37822005|264072009
hips,|29836001
or
other areas.|74964007|42798000

Many sufferers also|260396001
experience
varying degrees|246173007
of myofascial pain|396333008
and
have
high rates|75540009|371879000
of comorbid temporomandibular joint disorder.|41888000

20?30%
of patients|116154003
with rheumatoid arthritis|69896004
and
systemic lupus erythematosus|55464009
may
also
have
fibromyalgia.[26]|203102006

The cause|134198009
of fibromyalgia|203102006
is
currently|15240007
unknown.|261665006

However,
several hypotheses|261028005
have
been
developed
including|55919000
"central sensitization".|26216008|416167002

This theory
proposes
that fibromyalgia patients|203102006|116154003
have
a lower threshold|261122009|118589004
for pain|22253000
because of increased sensitivity|35105006|35209006|35105006|365705006|260366006|35209006|260366006|365705006
in the brain|12738006|258335003
to pain signals.[20]|22253000

There
is
evidence|18669006
that genetic factors|3950001|255395001
may
play|300776002
a role
in the development|278923009
of fibromyalgia.|203102006

For example,
there
is
a high aggregation|75540009|47286004|75540009|258746003|371879000|47286004|371879000|258746003
of fibromyalgia|203102006
in families.|35359004

Using|260676000
self-report|229059009|223458004
of chronic widespread pain (CWP)|82423001|85333001
as a surrogate marker
for fibromyalgia,|203102006
the Swedish Twin Registry reports|11286003|229059009|11286003|223458004|1305003|229059009|1305003|223458004
:
[29][30]

The mode
of inheritance|246071007
is
currently|15240007
unknown|261665006
,
but
it
is
most probably polygenic.|4757001

Research
has
also
demonstrated
that fibromyalgia|203102006
is
potentially
associated|47429007
with polymorphisms|50334000
of genes|67271001
in the serotoninergic,[32] dopaminergic[33]|16257000|264667004
and
catecholaminergic systems.|246333005

However,
these polymorphisms|50334000
are
not specific|69658003
for fibromyalgia|203102006
and
are
associated|47429007
with a variety
of allied disorders|64572001
(e.g.|258795003

chronic fatigue syndrome,|51771007
[35] irritable bowel syndrome[36]|10743008
)
and
with depression.[37]|35489007|366979004|255339005

Stress|262188008
may
be
an important precipitating factor
in the development|278923009
of fibromyalgia.|203102006

Fibromyalgia|203102006
is
frequently comorbid|70232002
with stress-related disorders|262188008|272151006|64572001|262188008|262094002|64572001
such as chronic fatigue syndrome,|51771007
posttraumatic stress disorder,|47505003
irritable bowel syndrome|10743008
and
depression.|35489007|366979004|255339005

A systematic review|415300000
found|404684003
significant association|386134007|263534001|386134007|272151006
between fibromyalgia|203102006
and
physical|5880005|19388002
and
sexual abuse|213017001
in
both
childhood|68433009
and
adulthood,|41847000
although
the quality|263496004
of studies|110465008|224699009
was
poor.[39]|11403006|255351007

Two|420797005
studies|110465008|224699009
that employed single-voxel magnetic resonance spectroscopy|224363007|125681006|241671007|224363007|50607009|241671007
(1H-MRS
)
reported|229059009|223458004
metabolic abnormalities|276654001
within the hippocampal complex|5366008|103360007
in patients|116154003
with fibromyalgia.|203102006

As the hippocampus|5366008|409925000|361561007
plays|300776002
crucial roles
in maintenance
of cognitive functions,|311465003
sleep regulation,|258158006
and
pain perception,
it
was
suggested
that metabolic dysfunction|386585008
of the hippocampus|5366008|409925000|361561007
may
be
implicated
in the appearance|386548000|255412001
of these symptoms.[40][41]|259031006

Other authors|74964007|308004006
have
proposed
that,
because
exposure|71677004|24932003
to stressful conditions|260905004
can
alter
the function|246464006
of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis,|442320004
the development|278923009
of fibromyalgia|203102006
may
stem
from stress-induced disruption|262188008|16404004|76555007
of the HPA axis.[42]|442320004

The "dopamine hypothesis|412383006|32779004
of fibromyalgia"|203102006
proposes
that
the central abnormality|26216008|276654001
responsible|394851003
for symptoms
associated|47429007
with fibromyalgia|203102006
is
a disruption|76555007
of normal dopamine-related neurotransmission.|17621005|412383006|272151006|55859003|17621005|412383006|262094002|55859003|17621005|32779004|272151006|55859003|17621005|32779004|262094002|55859003|258744000|412383006|272151006|55859003|258744000|412383006|262094002|55859003|258744000|32779004|272151006|55859003|258744000|32779004|262094002|55859003

Insufficient dopamine|71978007|412383006|71978007|32779004|423437008|412383006|423437008|32779004
in a part|260726005
of the body|279495008|123037004
is
termed hypodopaminergia.

Dopamine|412383006|32779004
is
a catecholamine neurotransmitter|34582008|35069000
with roles
in pain perception
and
natural analgesia.|510009|278414003|510009|38433004

There
is
also strong evidence|260404005|18669006
for a role
of dopamine|412383006|32779004
in restless leg syndrome,|32914008
[44]
which
is
a condition|260905004
found|404684003
frequently|70232002
in patients|116154003
with fibromyalgia.|203102006

Some fibromyalgia patients|203102006|116154003
responded
in controlled trials|31509003|110465008
to pramipexole,|386852009
a dopamine agonist|418222008
that selectively
stimulates
dopamine D2/D3 receptors|37484001
and
is
used to|394850002
treat|395077000
both
Parkinson's disease|49049000
and
restless leg syndrome.[46]|32914008

In 1975,
researchers
hypothesized
that serotonin,|33635003|50880007
a neurotransmitter|35069000
that
regulates
sleep patterns,|401175000
mood,|85256008
concentration|82742001
and
pain,|22253000
could
be
involved|248448006
in the pathophysiology|386585008
of fibromyalgia-associated symptoms.|203102006|102483000

In 1992,
decreased serotonin metabolites|1250004|33635003|1250004|50880007|260400001|33635003|260400001|50880007|260371004|33635003|260371004|50880007
in patient blood samples[47]|116154003|119297000
and
cerebrospinal fluid|65216001
were
reported.|229059009|223458004

However,
selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs)|373225007
have
met|229057006
with limited success|255469002|385669000
in alleviating
the symptoms
of the disorder,|64572001
while
drugs|410942007
with activity|48761009|55561003|258745004|257733005
as mixed serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs)|26242008|45555007
have
been
more successful.|242762006|385669000

In controlled trials|31509003|110465008
funded
by Eli Lily,
duloxetine|407032004
(Cymbalta,
an SNRI originally|407034003
used|394850002
to
treat|395077000
depression|35489007|366979004|255339005
and
painful diabetic neuropathy,|22253000|230572002
was
demonstrated
to
relieve|397855004
fibromyalgia symptoms|203102006
in some women,|224526002
however male subjects|248153007

of fibromyalgia|203102006

However,
the relevance
of dysregulated serotonin metabolism|33635003|47722004|50880007|47722004

of growth hormone (GH),|56234005|395883003

cortisol,|396458002
leptin|414601001|117694008

neuropeptide Y|50951002
may
be
abnormal|263654008
in people|125676002
with fibromyalgia,|203102006
[54]
but
supplementing growth hormone|373453009|56234005|373453009|395883003
in patients|116154003
does
not
have
large effects,|255509001|253861007
and
a 2007 literature review
reported|229059009|223458004
a need|410525008|103325001
for "further study|46053002|110465008|46053002|224699009

There
is
disagreement
about the role
of HGH|395883003
in fibromyalgia.[56][57][58][59]|203102006

There
is
strong evidence|260404005|18669006
that major depression|370143000
is
associated|47429007
with fibromyalgia,|203102006
[60]
although
the nature|277302009
of the association|263534001|272151006
is
debated.

A comprehensive review
into the relationship|272151006
between fibromyalgia|203102006
and
major depressive disorder (MDD)|370143000
found|404684003
substantial similarities
in neuroendocrine abnormalities,|276654001
psychological characteristics,|60224009
physical symptoms|5880005|19388002
and
treatments|276239002
between fibromyalgia|203102006
and
MDD,|370143000
but
currently available findings|15240007|103328004|404684003|15240007|103328004
do
not
support|9096001|243114000
the assumption
that MDD|370143000
and
fibromyalgia|203102006
refer|439980006
to the same underlying construct|262126009
or
can
be
seen
as subsidiaries
of one disease concept.|421379005|64572001

Indeed,
the sensation|106148006|271712005|272144002
of pain|22253000
has
at least two dimensions|276139006|420797005|255506008|263796003|420797005|255506008
:
a sensory dimension|262139008|255506008
which processes|415178003
the magnitude|246173007|272100000
and
location|246267002
of the pain,|22253000
and
an affective-motivational dimension|106121005|255506008
which processes|415178003
the unpleasantness.

Accordingly,
a study|110465008|224699009
that employed functional magnetic resonance imaging to|224363007|40143009|113091000|224363007|246464006|113091000
evaluate
brain responses|12738006|258335003
to experimental pain|22253000
among fibromyalgia patients|203102006|116154003
found|404684003
that depressive symptoms|394924000
were
associated|47429007
with the magnitude|246173007|272100000
of clinically induced pain response specifically|16404004|248240001
in areas|42798000
of the brain|12738006|258335003
that
participate
in affective pain processing,|22253000|415178003
but
not
in areas|42798000
involved|248448006
in sensory processing|262139008
which
indicates|410535002
that
the amplification
of the sensory dimension|262139008|255506008
of pain|22253000
in fibromyalgia|203102006
occurs|272120004

or
emotional processes.[62]|285854004|415178003|408453002|415178003

Differential activation|263735002
in response
to painful stimulation|22253000|122545008

also
been
demonstrated.

Evidence|18669006
of hippocampal disruption|5366008|76555007
indicated|410535002
by reduced brain metabolite ratios|260400001|12738006|118586006|260400001|258335003|118586006
has
been

by studies|110465008|224699009
using|260676000
single-voxel magnetic resonance spectroscopy|125681006|241671007|50607009|241671007
(1H-MRS
).

A significant negative correlation|386134007|260385009
was
demonstrated
between abnormal metabolite ratios|6957005
and
a validated index|419205000
of the clinical severity|58147004|272141005
(i.e.|42146005|22971001

the Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire|203102006|134293005
).

Correlations
between clinical pain severity|58147004|22253000|272141005

An acceleration|285659007
of normal age-related brain atrophy|17621005|424144002|272151006|278849000|17621005|424144002|262094002|278849000|258744000|424144002|272151006|278849000|258744000|424144002|262094002|278849000
has
been

using|260676000
voxel-based morphometry (VBM)|60374009|418836005|60374009
with areas|42798000
of reduced gray matter|260400001

in the cingulate cortex,|40146001
insula|36169008|279201009
and
parahippocampal gyrus.|13989007|279205000

Grey matter loss
appears
to
increase|260366006
9.5
times the normal rate|17621005|258744000
with each year.|258707000|259039008

Studies|110465008|224699009
utilizing
positron emission tomography|82918005
have
demonstrated
reduced dopamine synthesis|260400001|412383006|11798007|260400001|32779004|11798007
in the brainstem|15926001|180925009
and
elements|57795002
of the limbic cortex.|279215006

A significant negative correlation|386134007|260385009
between pain severity|22253000|272141005
and
dopamine synthesis|412383006|11798007|32779004|11798007
was
demonstrated
within the insular cortex.|36169008

A subsequent study|255260001|110465008|255260001|224699009
demonstrated
gross disruption|255344003|76555007
of dopaminergic reactivity|16257000|11214006
in response
to a tonic pain stimulus|22253000|8927009
within the basal ganglia|32610002
with a significant positive correlation|386134007|258758003|386134007|10828004
between the defining feature
of the disorder|64572001
(i.e.|42146005|22971001

tender point index|417009006|419205000
)
and
dopamine D2 receptor binding potential specifically|37484001|257768005|30207005
in the right putamen.|24028007|89278009|24028007|281512002

Finally,
reduced availability|260400001|103328004
of mu-opioid receptors|261956002|404642006|116647005
in the ventral striatum/nucleus accumbens|31428008|427667007
and
cingulate cortex|40146001
has
been
demonstrated
,
with a significant negative correlation|386134007|260385009
between affective pain levels|405161002
and
receptor availability|116647005|103328004
in the nucleus accumbens.[102]|427667007

There
is
no single|125681006|50607009
test|269814003|272393004
that
can
fully
diagnose|439401001
fibromyalgia|203102006
and
there
is
debate
over|21481007
what
should
be
considered
essential diagnostic criteria|34325006|439401001|34325006|261004008
and
whether
an objective diagnosis|410518001|439401001|410518001|260224007|439401001|260224007
is
possible.|371930009|60022001

In most cases,|398241000|413769002
patients|116154003
with fibromyalgia symptoms|203102006
may
also
have
laboratory test|269814003
results|394617004
that
appear
normal|17621005|258744000
and
many
of their symptoms
may
mimic
those
of other rheumatic conditions|74964007|396332003|260905004
such as arthritis|3723001
or
osteoporosis.|64859006

In general,|60132005
most doctors|309343006
diagnose|439401001
patients|116154003
with a process|415178003
called
differential diagnosis,|47965005
which means|255586005
that doctors|309343006
consider
all
of the possible things|371930009|60022001
that
might
be
wrong
with the patient|116154003
based|418836005
on the patient's symptoms,|116154003
gender,|263495000
age,|424144002
geographic location,|246267002
medical history|392521001
and
other factors.|74964007

They then
narrow|18043004|25659002|134223000
down the diagnosis|439401001
to the most likely one.|4757001|2931005|421379005

The most widely|4757001
accepted|385645004
set
of classification criteria|73504009
for research purposes|363675004
was
elaborated
in 1990
by the Multicenter Criteria Committee
of the American College of Rheumatology.|224864007|394810000|224864007|45440000

These criteria,
which
are
known|36692007
informally
as
"
the ACR 1990",
define
fibromyalgia|203102006
according to the presence|386397008
of the following criteria|255260001
:

The ACR criteria
for classification|73504009
of patients|116154003
were
originally
established|263748003|385645004
as inclusion criteria
for research purposes|363675004
and
were
not
intended|361269008
for clinical diagnosis|39154008
but
have
now
become
the _de facto_ diagnostic criteria|224046004|439401001|224046004|261004008|223637004|439401001|223637004|261004008
in the clinical setting.|58147004

It
should
be
noted
that
the number|410680006|410681005
of tender|300820003
points
that
may
be
active|55561003
at any one time|421379005|410669006
may
vary
with time|410669006
and
circumstance.

A controversial study|110465008|224699009
done
by a legal team looking to|398165009|386548000
prove|277025001
their client's disability|21134002
based|418836005
primarily
on tender points|417009006
and
their widespread presence|85333001|386397008
in non-litigious communities|133928008
prompted
the lead author|88488004|308004006
of the ACR criteria
to now
question
the useful validity
of tender|300820003
points
in diagnosis.|439401001

Since
the ACR criteria
were
originally
published
,
research
with mechanical devices|261018001|303607000|261018001|49062001
that
exert|19487008
defined pressure|279046003|13543005|257893003
indicate|410535002
that diagnosis|439401001
of fibromyalgia|203102006
cannot
be
done
objectively
by machine|61284002
and
require
a physician's subjective estimate|309343006|255362007|414135002
of
how
much pressure|279046003|13543005|257893003
should
be
exerted.|19487008

As
with many other medically unexplained syndromes,|74964007
there
is
no universally accepted treatment|385645004|276239002|385645004|416118004
or
cure
for fibromyalgia,|203102006
and
treatment typically|276239002|416118004
consists
of symptom management.|103735009

Developments|278923009
in the understanding|66216009
of the pathophysiology|386585008
of the disorder|64572001
have
led|88488004|236874000
to improvements
in treatment,|52101004|276239002|52101004|416118004|18720000|276239002|18720000|416118004
which
include|55919000
prescription medication,|260885003|410942007
behavioral intervention,|166001
exercise,|61686008
and
alternative
and
complementary medicine.|410942007

Indeed,
integrated treatment|276239002|416118004
plans|312011006|52713000|397943006
that
incorporate
medication,|410942007
patient education,|311401005
aerobic exercise|229072005
and
cognitive-behavioral therapy|228553007
have
been
shown
to
be
effective|255403003|254648000
in alleviating pain|22253000
and
other fibromyalgia-related symptoms.|74964007|203102006|272151006|74964007|203102006|262094002

In 2005,
the American Pain Society|22253000
produced
comprehensive guidelines
for patient evaluation|116154003|116154003|386053000
and
management.|413454004|119270007

More recently,|242762006|6493001
the European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR)|414152003|396332003|396332003
issued|55607006
updated treatment guidelines.[106]|276239002|416118004

Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT)|228553007
and
related psychological/behavioral therapies|272151006|390822007|844005|262094002|390822007|844005
are
evidence-based treatments|18669006|276239002|18669006|418836005|276239002
which
have
been
shown
to
be
moderately effective|255403003|254648000
in randomized controlled trials.|31509003|110465008

The greatest benefit|4757001
occurs|272120004
when
CBT|228553007
is
used|394850002
along
with exercise.[11][108]|61686008

A meta-analysis|272389005
of 1,119 subjects|260305007
found|404684003
"strong evidence|260404005|18669006
that multicomponent treatment|276239002|416118004
has
beneficial short-term effects|253861007
on key symptoms
of FMS."
[109]
A 2010 systematic review|415300000
of 14 studies|110465008|224699009
reported|229059009|223458004
that CBT|228553007
improves|385425000|3442003|385633008
self-efficacy
or
coping|405056001
with pain|22253000
and
reduces|260400001
the number|410680006|410681005
of physician|309343006
visits
at post-treatment,|288563008|276239002|288563008|416118004
but
has
no significant effect|386134007|253861007
on pain,|22253000
fatigue,|84229001
sleep|258158006
or
health|263775005
related|272151006|262094002
quality|263496004
of life|224130005
at post-treatment|288563008|276239002|288563008|416118004
or
followup.|308273005

Depressed mood|366979004
was
also
improved|385425000|3442003
but
this
could
not
be
distinguished
from some
risks|30207005
of bias.

A multidisciplinary approach,
often|70232002
including|55919000
CBT|228553007
is
sometimes
considered
to
be
the "gold standard"|2309006|371256005
of treatment|276239002|416118004
for chronic pain syndromes|373621006
such as fibromyalgia.|203102006

There
are
three medications|421291004|410942007
that
have
been
approved|9571008
by the FDA
for treatment|276239002|416118004
of fibromyalgia.|203102006

Pregabalin|415160008
was
approved|9571008
in June 2007,
duloxetine|407032004
was
approved|9571008
in June 2008,
and
milnacipran|442619000|442542004
was
approved|9571008
in January 2009.

Pregabalin|415160008
and
duloxetine|407032004
have
been
shown
to
reduce|260400001
pain|22253000
in a substantial number|410680006|410681005
of patients|116154003
with fibromyalgia,|203102006
but
there
were
others|74964007
who
did
not
benefit.

Placebo-controlled trials|31509003|110465008
involving|248448006
a total|258755000|255619001
of over 2000 patients|21481007|116154003
have
shown
milnacipran|442619000|442542004
to
be
significantly more effective|255403003|254648000
than placebo
in treating|28995006
both
pain|22253000
and
the broader syndrome|90522003
of ?bromyalgia.[112][113]

A 2009 meta-analysis|272389005
in the Journal
of the American Medical Association|74188005|263534001|74188005|272151006
concluded
that antidepressants|372720008
were
"

The authors also|308004006
stated|398070004
that
the goal|410518001
of antidepressants|372720008
in fibromyalgia|203102006
should
be
"possible symptom reduction",|371930009|58294000|371930009|260400001|371930009|289928003|60022001|58294000|60022001|260400001|60022001|289928003
and
if used long term,|394850002
their effects|253861007
should
be
evaluated
against side effects.

Tricyclic antidepressants|373253007
were
the most effective|4757001|255403003|4757001|254648000
against pain,|22253000
fatigue,|84229001
and
sleep problems,|44186003
but
have
many side effects
due to interaction
with adrenergic, cholinergic
or
histaminergic receptors,|116647005
and
sodium channels.|39972003|255592004

Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs)|373225007
and
Serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs)|45555007
had
lower side effects.|261122009

Tramadol,|386858008

is
moderately effective|255403003|254648000
in treating fibromyalgia pain.|28995006|203102006|22253000

Long-term effectiveness|255403003

tolerability
are
unknown.|261665006

Tramadol|386858008
combined|89780004
with paracetamol|387517004
provides
fast,|16985007|277748003

is
more effective|242762006|255403003|242762006|254648000

either
drug|410942007

This combination therapy|229554006
has
demonstrated efficacy,
safety
and
tolerability
for
up to two years|420797005|258707000
without the development|278923009
of tolerance,|228432001|77472006|71412006
in the treatment|276239002|416118004

It
is
as effective|255403003|254648000
as codeine|387494007|105142004
plus
paracetamol|387517004
but
produces
less
sleepiness|271782001

it
is
free|37837009

and
associated pain|47429007|22253000
in acute musculoskeletal conditions.|272118002|260905004

It

According to a 2004 review
of fibromyalgia treatment studies,|203102006|276239002
opioids|404642006
(
other than tramadol|386858008

"
An analysis|272389005
of insurance
claims

As of 2010,
there

Long-term use|277889008|419385000
of opioids|404642006
may
worsen|230993007|390772001
pain|22253000

Additionally opioids|404642006
are
not

Preliminary research|261420005
on naltrexone|373546002
at very low dosage|260362008|277406006

in reducing fibromyalgia symptoms|260400001|203102006
by more|242762006
than 30 percent|118582008

Naltrexone,|373546002

at very low dosage,|260362008|277406006
to

and
fatigue|84229001
in some people|125676002
with fibromyalgia.|203102006

In particular, there
is
strong evidence|260404005|18669006
that cardiovascular exercise|113257007|61686008
is
effective|255403003|254648000
for some patients.|116154003

Long-term aquatic-based exercise|61686008|418836005|61686008
has
been
proven beneficial|277025001
as
it
combines|20909006
cardiovascular exercise|113257007|61686008
with resistance training.|30714006|118629009

However,
due to the cold sensitivities|80585000
of people|125676002
with fibromyalgia syndrome,|203102006
aquatic therapy|276239002
must
take|419652001
place|257557008|421066005
in a warm pool.|69297003

Not only
that,
but
the air temperature|417696007|105723007|417696007|246508008
outside of the pool|69297003
must
also
be
heated|88999006
to
prevent
fibromyalgia patients|203102006|116154003
from getting chills|43724002
and
aches|410711009
when
out of the water.|11713004|119318008

This
involves|248448006
a specialised pool facility,|67995009|69297003|69297003
which
makes
this therapy|276239002
more expensive|242762006
and
less accessible|276139006|260507000|263796003|260507000
than regular swimming exercise.|225925001|20461001

Tai chi|30900002

in a relative benefit ratio|118593005
of 2.0|260306008

and
a relative benefit increase|125677006|260366006|29920004|260366006

the number|410680006|410681005

In the majority
of the literature
on therapy options|276239002
for fibromyalgia,|203102006
an overwhelming number|410680006|410681005
of studies|110465008|224699009
echo
the same sentiment|262126009
:
that
the optimal intervention|225334002
for fibromyalgia|203102006
would
include|55919000
a treatment package,|276239002|416118004
consisting
of appropriate medications|410942007
in combination|89780004
with non-pharmacological treatments|416608005
including|55919000
physical exercise|61686008
and
cognitive behaviour therapy.|228553007

Although
the majority
of fibromyalgia treatment reviews|203102006|225303001
recommend
this multi-treatment approach,|260396001|276239002|260396001|416118004
very|260358002
few actually
study|110465008|224699009
the interactive benefits
of combining|89780004|20909006
the therapy options,|276239002
with many stating|260396001|398070004
that ?more|242762006
research
needs|410525008|103325001

be
done.?
By adding parts|260726005
of each
of the three therapy options|421291004|276239002
(drug therapy,|416608005
exercise,|61686008
and
cognitive-behavioural therapy|228553007
)
,
fibromyalgia patients|203102006|116154003
and
clinicians
have
the ability to|371150009
create
individualised treatment packages|276239002|416118004
that
suit
the patient?s particular needs.|103325001

Because
not
everyone
with fibromyalgia|203102006
experiences
the same co-morbidities|262126009
and
secondary symptoms,|2603003|81170007

have
treatment options|276239002|416118004

as much pain-related medication|22253000|272151006|410942007|22253000|262094002|410942007
as those without fibromyalgia.|45169001|203102006

Furthermore,
the use|277889008|419385000
of medications|410942007
and
medical necessities|74188005
increased|35105006|260366006
markedly|46998006
across many measures|246445000|367346004
once diagnosis|439401001
was
made.[146]

Although
in itself
neither
degenerative|33359002
nor
fatal,|399166001
the chronic pain|82423001
of fibromyalgia|203102006
is
pervasive|85333001
and
persistent.

Most fibromyalgia patients|203102006|116154003
report|229059009|223458004
that
their symptoms
do
not
improve|385425000|3442003|385633008
over time.|410669006

An evaluation|386053000
of 332 consecutive new fibromyalgia patients|7147002|203102006|116154003
found|404684003
that disease-related factors|64572001|272151006|64572001|262094002
such as pain|22253000
and
psychological factors|60224009
such as work status,|261041009|263490005
helplessness,
education,|266981003|409073007
and
coping ability|405056001|371150009
had
an independent|371153006
and
significant relationship|386134007|272151006
to FM symptom severity|162465004
and
function.[147]|246464006

Fibromyalgia|203102006
is
seen
in about 2%
of the general population[148]|60132005|385436007|60132005|389109008
and
affects|4065008
more females|242762006|248152002
than males,|248153007
with a ratio|118586006
of 9
:
1
by ACR criteria.

It
is
most commonly|4757001
diagnosed|439401001
in individuals|125676002|385435006
between the ages|424144002
of 20
and
50,
though
onset|77374008
can
occur|272120004
in childhood.|68433009

Many names,|260396001
including|55919000
"muscular rheumatism",|203102006
"fibrositis",|203102006
"psychogenic rheumatism",|247364000
and
"neurasthenia"
were
applied|410618006
historically
to symptoms
resembling
those
of fibromyalgia.|203102006

The term _fibromyalgia_|203102006
was
coined
by researcher Mohammed Yunus
as a synonym
for fibrositis|203102006
and
was
first|255216001|232714002
used|394850002
in a scientific publication
in 1981.

Fibromyalgia|203102006
is
from the Latin _fibra_|400293002
(fiber|116272000|400293002|87028007|37202001
)
[152]
and
the Greek words _myo_|1451003|255373000
(muscle|91727004
)
[153]
and
_algos_
(pain|22253000
).[154]

Historical perspectives|392521001
on the development|278923009
of the fibromyalgia concept|203102006
note
the "central importance"|26216008
of a 1977 paper|50833004
by Smythe
and
Moldofsky
on fibrositis.|203102006

The first clinical, controlled study|255216001|58147004|31509003|110465008|255216001|58147004|31509003|224699009|232714002|58147004|31509003|110465008|232714002|58147004|31509003|224699009
of the characteristics
of fibromyalgia syndrome|203102006
was
published
in 1981,
[156] providing support|9096001|243114000
for symptom associations.|263534001

In 1984,
an interconnection
between fibromyalgia syndrome|203102006
and
other similar conditions|74964007|260905004
was
proposed
,
[157]
and
in 1986,
trials|110465008
of the first proposed medications|255216001|410942007|232714002|410942007
for fibromyalgia|203102006
were
published.[157]

A 1987 article
in the _Journal
of the American Medical Association_|74188005|263534001|74188005|272151006
used|394850002
the term "fibromyalgia syndrome"|203102006
while
saying|66049007
it
was
a "controversial condition".|260905004

The American College of Rheumatology (ACR)|224864007|394810000|224864007|45440000
published
its first classification criteria|255216001|73504009|232714002|73504009
for fibromyalgia|203102006
in 1990,
[1]|260305007
although
these
are
not strictly diagnostic criteria.[159]|439401001|261004008

Fibromyalgia|203102006
continues|255238004
to
be
a disputed diagnosis.|9182005|439401001|9182005

Many members|260396001|394852005
of the medical community|74188005|133928008
do
not
consider
fibromyalgia|203102006
a disease|64572001
because of a lack|41277001
of abnormalities|276654001
on physical examination,|5880005
and
the absence|2667000|418560003
of objective diagnostic tests.[21][22]|410518001|103693007|260224007|103693007

Several theories|261028005
propose
that fibromyalgia|203102006
is
a somatoform disorder.[160]|31297008

Several controversial issues|261028005|55607006
exist
with regard to
fibromyalgia|203102006
that range
from questions|42425007
regarding
the validity
of the disorder|64572001
as a clinical entity,|58147004
to issues|55607006
regarding
primary pathophysiology|63161005|386585008|261424001|386585008
and
the potential existence|30207005
of fibromyalgia subtypes.|203102006|260837004

According to Frederick Wolfe,
lead author|88488004|308004006
of the 1990 paper|50833004
that
first
defined
the ACR fibromyalgia classification criteria,|203102006|73504009
_[citation
needed|410525008|103325001
_]"
the large majority|255509001
of physicians,|309343006
sociologists,|824004
and
medical historians"[21]|74188005|78826004
are
skeptical
about the validity
of fibromyalgia|203102006
as a clinical entity.|58147004

Some call fibromyalgia|277571004|203102006
a "non-disease"[22]|64572001
and
"
an over-inclusive|21481007|55919000
and
ultimately meaningless label."[162] Wolfe now
questions
the validity
of fibromyalgia|203102006
as a disease.|64572001

He
considers
fibromyalgia|203102006
a physical response|5880005|19388002
to stress,|262188008
depression,|35489007|366979004|255339005
and
economic
and
social anxiety,|247832004
[163]
and
believes
the associated symptoms|102483000
are
a normal part|17621005|260726005|258744000|260726005
of everyday life.|69620002|224130005

In 2009,
he
wrote|12261009
,
"
the tendency to
respond
with distress|69328002
to physical|5880005|19388002
and
mental stressors
is
part|260726005
of the human condition."[164] Wolfe|278412004|260905004
notes
that,
"opponents
of the fibromyalgia concept|203102006
argue
that,
as
it
is
a non-disease,|64572001
we
are
legitimising patients' sickness behaviour|116154003|278869005
by providing
a disease label."[165]|64572001

Yunus
has
referred|439980006
to some physicians' belief|309343006
that FM
is
psychological|60224009
in nature|277302009
as Disturbed Physician Syndrome (DPS)|309343006
:
"
It
is
the physicians|309343006
who
are
psychologically
disturbed
because
they
ignore
the data,
and
whatever data there
is
,
they
manipulate|129408000
it to
say|66049007
what they
want|410526009
it to
say."[166]|66049007

In a study|110465008|224699009
of 100 individuals|125676002|385435006
identified|7882003
as
having
fibromyalgia,|203102006
physical functioning|5880005|246464006|19388002|246464006
decreased|1250004|260400001|260371004
slightly|425404009
over time,|410669006
and
individuals|125676002|385435006
who
had
been
diagnosed|439401001
earlier|264499004
had
larger numbers|255509001|410680006|255509001|410681005|263768009|410680006|263768009|410681005
of reported symptoms|229059009|223458004
and
greater severity.|263768009|272141005

However,
there
was
also
a statistically significant improvement|386134007
in satisfaction
with health|263775005
following|255260001
classification.|73504009

The authors|308004006
of the study|110465008|224699009
concluded
that
the ?fibromyalgia label?|203102006
does
not
have
a meaningful adverse effect|281647001
on clinical outcome|58147004|394617004
over the long term.

The validity
of fibromyalgia|203102006
as a unique clinical entity|58147004
is
also
a matter
of contention because "
no discrete boundary
separates|13184001|263869007
syndromes
such as FMS,
chronic fatigue syndrome,|51771007
irritable bowel syndrome,|10743008
or
chronic muscular headaches."[115][168]|90734009|398126006
Because of this considerable symptomatic overlap,|264931009|24846002
some researchers
have
proposed
that fibromyalgia|203102006
and
other syndromes|74964007
with overlapping symptoms|24846002
be
classified|73504009
as functional somatic syndromes|40143009|387133006|246464006|387133006
for some purposes.[169]|363675004

Some researchers_[
who?_]
believe
that differences|263735002
in psychological|60224009
and
autonomic nervous system profiles|72167002
among affected individuals|247591002|125676002|247591002|385435006|248448006|125676002|248448006|385435006
may
indicate|410535002
the existence
of fibromyalgia subtypes.|203102006|260837004

A 2007 review
divides|422033008
individuals|125676002|385435006
with fibromyalgia|203102006
into four groups|421534005|261586004|421534005|160481000
as well as
"mixed types"|26242008|261664005
:
[159]

Other researchers|74964007
have
suggested
that depression|35489007|366979004|255339005
may
be
a result|394617004
of coping|405056001
with the disabling impacts|134293005
of a,
thus far,|46053002
incurable disease.[170]|64572001
