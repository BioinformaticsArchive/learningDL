*Hemiparesis|127377003
*
*
is
weakness|13791008|260407003
on one side|66459002
of the body.|279495008|123037004

It
is
less severe|276139006|24484000|263796003|24484000
than hemiplegia ?|50582007
the total paralysis|258755000|44695005|255619001|44695005
of the arm,|40983000|53120007|182245002|302538001
leg,|61685007|30021000|182281004|362793004
and
trunk|22943007|262225004
on one side|66459002
of the body.|279495008|123037004

Thus,
the patient|116154003
can
move|302000008|384598002|370125004
the impaired side|260379002|182353008|40226000|182353008
of his body,|279495008|123037004
but
with reduced muscular strength.|260400001|91727004|260404005|260400001|263816006|260404005

Hemiparesis|127377003
can
be
caused|23981006|134198009
by a number|410680006|410681005
of medical conditions,|74188005|260905004
most
related|272151006|262094002
to the brain|12738006|258335003
or
spinal cord.|2748008|180959008

Some
of the conditions|260905004
that
have
hemiparesis|127377003
as
either
an indicative symptom
or
as a result|394617004
of the condition|260905004
itself
include|55919000
migraine,|37796009
head trauma,|82271004
muscular dystrophy,|73297009
stroke,|230690007
brain tumors,|126952004
or
cerebral palsy.[1]|128188000

Depending
on the type|261664005
of hemiparesis|127377003
diagnosed|439401001
,
different bodily functions|263735002|246464006
can
be
affected.|247591002|248448006

Some effects|253861007
are
expected
(i.e.,|42146005|22971001
partial paralysis
of a limb|66019005|243996003
on the affected side|247591002|182353008|248448006|182353008
).

Other impairments,|74964007|40226000
though
,
can
at first
seem
completely non-related|272151006|262094002
to the limb weakness|309774006
but
are
,
in fact,
a direct result|255589003|394617004
of the damage|37782003
to the affected side|247591002|182353008|248448006|182353008
of the brain.[1]|12738006|258335003

People|125676002
with hemiparesis often|127377003|70232002
have
difficulties|371157007
maintaining|385630006
their balance|249982003|78933003|282295000
due to limb weaknesses|309774006
leading|236874000
to an inability
to properly
shift|9546005
body weight.|27113001|39857003

This
makes
performing everyday activities|69620002|257733005
such as dressing,|333453004|3895009|165235000|129003000
eating|48263008
,
grabbing
objects,|260787004
or
using|260676000
the bathroom|223359008
more difficult|242762006|52925006
.

Hemiparesis|127377003
with origin|255395001
in the lower section|261122009|62083003|261122009|118630004
of the brain|12738006|258335003
creates
a condition|260905004
known|36692007
as ataxia,|20262006
a loss
of
both
gross|255344003
and
fine motor skills,|3082000
often|70232002
manifesting|250255003
as staggering|241994005
and
stumbling.|82612009

Pure Motor Hemiparesis,|127377003
a form|246176004
of hemiparesis|127377003
characterized
by sided weakness|182353008|13791008|182353008|182353008|260407003|277806003|13791008|277806003|277806003|260407003

and
face,|89545001|302549007
is
the most commonly diagnosed form|4757001|439401001|246176004
of hemiparesis.[1]|127377003

Right-sided hemiparesis|24028007|127377003|264180000|127377003
involves|248448006
injury
to the left side|7771000
of the person's brain,|125676002|12738006|125676002|258335003
which
is
the side|182353008
of the brain controlling speech|12738006|54776003|12738006|31509003|258335003|54776003|258335003|31509003
and
language.|61909002

People|125676002
who
have
this type|261664005
of hemiparesis often|127377003|70232002
experience
difficulty|371157007
with talking|87335007
and
understanding|66216009
what others say.[1]|74964007

In addition|260364009
to problems|55607006
understanding|66216009
or
using|260676000
speech,
persons|125676002
with right-sided hemiparesis often|24028007|127377003|70232002|264180000|127377003|70232002
have
difficulty distinguishing left|371157007|7771000
from right.|24028007

When
asked
to
turn|282987006
left|7771000
or
right,|24028007
or
to
raise|260399008
a left|7771000

Left-sided hemiparesis|7771000|127377003|263795004|127377003
involves|248448006
injury
to the right side|24028007
of the person's brain,|125676002|12738006|125676002|258335003
which
controls|54776003|31509003

certain types|17162000|261664005
of behavior,|844005
and
non-verbal communication.|255373000|263536004

Injury
to this area|42798000
of a person's brain|125676002|12738006|125676002|258335003
may
also
cause|23981006|134198009
people to|125676002
talk|87335007|286376008
excessively,|260378005
have
short attention spans,|247762003
and
have
problems|55607006
with short-term memory.[1]|69262000

?Pusher syndrome?|249979008
is
a recently|6493001
identified|7882003
clinical disorder|58147004|64572001
following|255260001
left|7771000
or
right brain damage|24028007|2470005
in which patients actively|116154003
push|420620005
their weight away|27113001|272102008|39857003
from the nonhemiparetic side|182353008
to the hemiparetic side.|182353008

In contrast
to most stroke patients,|230690007|116154003
who typically
prefer|225773000
more weight-bearing|242762006|249981005
on their nonhemiparetic side,|182353008
this abnormal condition|263654008|260905004
can
vary
in severity|272141005
and
leads|88488004|236874000
to a loss
of postural balance.|416240000

The lesion
involved|248448006
in this syndrome
is
thought to|88952004
be
in the posterior thalamus|255551008|42695009|255551008|244433007
on
either
side,|182353008
or
multiple areas|260396001|42798000
of the right cerebral hemisphere.[3][4]|5228007

With a diagnosis|439401001
of pusher behaviour,|844005
3 important variables|260313008|255372005
should
be
seen.

The most obvious|4757001
of which
is
spontaneous body posture|5054005|363855006
of a longitudinal tilt|38717003
of the torso|22943007
toward the paretic side|182353008
of the body|279495008|123037004
occurring|272120004
on a regular basis|17854005|17854005|418836005
and
not only
on occasion.|84638005

The use|277889008|419385000
of the nonparetic extremities to|66019005|2592007
create
the pathological lateral tilt|394595002|49370004|29458008|49370004
of the body axis|279495008|39976000|279495008|388282002|123037004|39976000|123037004|388282002
is
another sign to|72670004
be
noted
when
diagnosing|439401001
for pusher behaviour.|844005

This
includes|55919000
abduction|60074003
and
extension|255536004
of the extremities|66019005|2592007
of the non ?affected side,|247591002|182353008|248448006|182353008
to
help
in the push|420620005
toward the affected|247591002|248448006
(paretic
)
side.|182353008

The third variable|70905002|255372005
that
is
seen
is
that attempts
of the therapist
to correct
the pusher posture|363855006
by aiming to
realign
them
to upright posture|363855006
are
resisted
by the patient.|116154003

[2]|260306008

In patients|116154003
with acute stroke|272118002|230690007
and
hemiparesis,|127377003
the disorder|64572001
is
present|52101004|246105001
in 10.4%
of patients.|116154003

Rehabilitation|52052004|394602003
may
take|419652001
longer|255511005
in patients|116154003
that
display
pusher behaviour.|844005

The Copenhagen Stroke Study|230690007|110465008|230690007|224699009
found|404684003
that patients|116154003
that
presented|246105001
with ipsilateral pushing|255208005|420620005
used|394850002
3.6 weeks more to|260281002|258705008
reach|282679008
the same functional outcome level|262126009|40143009|394617004|258395000|262126009|40143009|394617004|276625007|262126009|246464006|394617004|258395000|262126009|246464006|394617004|276625007
on the Barthel Index,|273302005
than
did
patients|116154003
without ipsilateral pushing.[5]|255208005|420620005

Pushing behavior|420620005|844005
has
shown
that perception|81742003
of body posture|363855006
in relation to gravity|91071007
is
altered.

Patients|116154003
experience
their body|279495008|123037004
as
oriented ?upright?|311552005
when
the body|279495008|123037004
is
actually
tilted
to the side|182353008
of the brain lesion.|301766008

In addition,|260364009
patients|116154003
seem
to
show
no disturbed processing
of visual|255374006
and
vestibular inputs|279732009|181188003
when
determining
subjective visual vertical.|255362007|255374006|33096000

In sitting,|33586001
the push|420620005
presents|52101004|246105001
as a strong lateral lean|260404005|49370004
toward the affected side|247591002|182353008|248448006|182353008
and
in standing,|10904000
creates
a highly unstable situation|75540009|263922001
as the patient|116154003
is
unable to|371151008
support|9096001|243114000
their body weight|27113001|39857003
on the weakened lower extremity.|61685007

The increased risk|35105006|30207005|260366006|30207005
of falls|1912002
must
be
addressed|397635003
with therapy|276239002
to correct
their altered perception|81742003
of vertical.|33096000

Pusher syndrome|249979008
is
sometimes
confused|286933003
with
and
used|394850002
interchangeably
as the term hemispatial neglect,|95930005
and
some previous theories|9130008
suggest
that neglect|95930005
leads|88488004|236874000
to pusher syndrome.|249979008

However
another study,|110465008|224699009
had
observed
that pusher syndrome|249979008
is
also
present|52101004|246105001
in patients|116154003
with left hemisphere lesions,|7771000
leading|236874000
to aphasia,|87486003
providing
a stark contrast
to what
was
previously
believed
regarding
hemispatial neglect,|95930005
which mostly
occurs|272120004
with a right hemisphere lesion.|24028007

[6]

Karnath[2]
summarizes
these two conflicting views,|420797005|15863006|246516004
as
they
conclude
that
both
neglect|95930005
and
aphasia|87486003
are
highly|75540009
correlated
with pusher syndrome possibly|249979008|60022001
due to the close proximity|29179001
of relevant brain structures|12738006
associated|47429007
with these two respective syndromes.|420797005

However
the article goes
on to
state|398070004
that
it
is
imperative to
note
that
both
neglect|95930005
and
aphasia|87486003
are
not
the underlying causes|134198009
of pusher syndrome.|249979008

Physical therapists focus|36682004|87017008|36682004|363702006
on motor learning strategies|69998004
when
treating|28995006
these patients.|116154003

Verbal cues,|255373000
consistent feedback,|385433004
practicing
correct orientation|43173001|311552005
and
weight shifting|27113001|9546005|272102008|9546005|39857003|9546005
are
all effective strategies|255403003|254648000
used|394850002
to
reduce|260400001
the effects|253861007
of this disorder.|64572001

Having
a patient sit|116154003|33586001|116154003|282967005
with their stronger side next to|260404005|182353008|18769003
a wall|224727009
and
instructing
them
to lean
towards the wall|224727009
is
an example
of a possible treatment|371930009|276239002|371930009|416118004|60022001|276239002|60022001|416118004
for pusher behaviour.[2]|844005

A new physical therapy approach|7147002|91251008
for patients|116154003
with pusher syndrome|249979008
suggests
that
the visual control|255374006|31509003
of vertical upright orientation,|33096000|43173001|33096000|311552005
which
is
undisturbed
in these patients,|116154003
is
the central element|26216008|57795002
of intervention|225334002
in treatment.|52101004|276239002|52101004|416118004|18720000|276239002|18720000|416118004

In sequential order,
treatment|276239002|416118004
is
designed
for patients to|116154003
realize
their altered perception|81742003
of vertical,|33096000
use|277889008|419385000
visual aids|266729006
for feedback
about body orientation,|279495008|43173001|279495008|311552005|123037004|43173001|123037004|311552005
learn|69998004
the movements necessary to|255324009
reach|282679008
proper vertical position,|33096000|246449006
and
maintain|385630006
vertical body position|33096000|363855006
while
performing|398166005
other activities.[2]|74964007|257733005

Individuals|125676002|385435006
who
present|52101004|246105001
with pusher syndrome|249979008
or
lateropulsion,
as
defined
by Davies,
vary
in their degree|258395000|246173007
and
severity|272141005
of this condition|260905004
and
therefore appropriate measures|246445000|367346004
need|410525008|103325001
to
be
implemented
in order to
evaluate
the level|258395000|276625007
of ?pushing?.|420620005

There
has
been
a shift|9546005
towards early diagnosis|264499004|439401001|264499004
and
evaluation|386053000
of functional status|40143009|263490005|246464006|263490005
for individuals|125676002|385435006
who
have
suffered
from a stroke|230690007
and
presenting|246105001
with pusher syndrome|249979008
in order to
decrease|260400001|260370003
the time|410669006
spent
as an in-patient|52101004|116154003|18720000|116154003
at hospitals
and
promote
the return to|7528007
function|246464006
as early|264499004
as possible.|371930009|60022001

Moreover,
in order to
assist|116697009|119265000
therapists
in the classification|73504009
of pusher syndrome,|249979008
specific scales|69658003|19892000|69658003|13389002
have
been
developed
with validity
that coincides
with the criteria
set
out
by Davies? definition
of ?pusher syndrome?.|249979008

In a study|110465008|224699009
by Babyar _
et
al._,
an examination|5880005
of such scales|19892000|13389002
helped
determine
the relevance,
practical aspects
and
clinimetric properties|370130000|116685008
of three specific scales|421291004|69658003|19892000|421291004|69658003|13389002
existing
today
for lateropulsion.

The three scales|421291004|19892000|421291004|13389002
examined|64049009
were
the Clinical Scale|58147004|19892000|58147004|278111002
of Contraversive Pushing,|420620005
Modified Scale|19892000|278111002|243326001|19892000|243326001|278111002
of Contraversive Pushing,|420620005
and
the Burke Lateropulsion Scale.|19892000|278111002

The results|394617004
of the study|110465008|224699009
show
that reliability
for each scale|19892000|278111002
is
good|20572008
;
moreover,
the Scale|19892000|278111002
of Contraversive Pushing|420620005
was
determined
to
have
acceptable clinimetric properties,|370130000|116685008
and
the other two scales|74964007|420797005|19892000|74964007|420797005|13389002
addressed|397635003
more functional positions|242762006|40143009|246449006|242762006|246464006|246449006
that
will
help
therapists
with clinical decisions|58147004
and
research.[9]

Treatment|276239002|416118004
for hemiparesis|127377003
is
the same treatment|262126009|276239002|262126009|416118004
given|419582001
to those recovering|74822006
from strokes|230690007
or
brain injuries.|2470005

Health care professionals
such as physical therapists|36682004
play|300776002
a large role|255509001
in assisting|119265000
these patients|116154003
in their recovery.

Treatment|276239002|416118004
is
focused|87017008|363702006
on improving sensation|385633008|106148006|385633008|271712005|385633008|272144002
and
motor abilities,|371150009
allowing
the patient to better|116154003|3442003
manage|119270007
their activities|257733005
of daily living.|69620002

Some strategies
used|394850002
for treatment|276239002|416118004
include|55919000
promoting
the use|277889008|419385000
of the hemiparetic limb|66019005|243996003
during functional tasks,|40143009|246464006
maintaining|385630006
range of motion,|364564000|85680003
and
using|260676000
neuromuscular electrical stimulation to
decrease|260400001|260370003
spasticity|397790002
and
increase awareness|260366006|312012004
of the limb.|66019005|243996003

At the more advanced level,|242762006|86005002|258395000|242762006|86005002|276625007
using|260676000
constraint-induced movement therapy|263856008|16404004|229064008
will
encourage
overall function|246464006
and
use|277889008|419385000
of the affected limb.|247591002|66019005|247591002|243996003|248448006|66019005|248448006|243996003

Mirror Therapy|47162009|276239002
(MT
)
has
also
been
used|394850002
early|264499004
in stroke rehabilitation|2517002
and
involves|248448006
using|260676000
the unaffected limb to|66019005|243996003
stimulate
motor function|52479005
of the hemiparetic limb.|66019005|243996003

Results|394617004
from a study|110465008|224699009
on patients|116154003
with severe hemiparesis|24484000|127377003
concluded
that MT
was
successful|385669000
in improving motor|385633008
and
sensory function|106148006
of the distal hemiparetic upper limb.|46053002|53120007|46053002|182245002

Active participation|55561003
is
critical
to the motor learning|69998004
and
recovery process,|415178003
therefore it?s important to
keep
these individuals|125676002|385435006
motivated
so
they
can
make
continual improvements.[12]|263730007
