*cystic acne|13277001
*
*
or
simply
*
*acne|88616000|11381005

)
is
a common human skin disease,|72906007|278412004|95320005
characterized
by areas|42798000
of skin|119325001|39937001|181469002
with seborrhea|86708008
(scaly red skin|271761007|386713009|271761007|371240000
)
,
comedones|247467008
(blackheads|271763005
and
whiteheads|247468003
)
,
papules|443871003
(pinheads
)
,
pustules|271760008
(pimples,|103605005
nodules|27925004|279365004
(large papules|255509001|443871003
)
and
possibly scarring.|60022001|60022001|275322007

Acne|88616000|11381005
affects|4065008
mostly skin|119325001|39937001|181469002
with the densest population|255596001|385436007|255596001|389109008
of sebaceous follicles|24162005|67290009
;
these areas|42798000
include|55919000
the face,|89545001|302549007
the upper part|261183002|260726005
of the chest,|261179002
and
the
back.

Severe acne|24484000|88616000|24484000|11381005
is
inflammatory,
but
acne|88616000|11381005
can
also
manifest|250255003
in noninflammatory forms.|260391006|246176004

The lesions
are
caused|23981006|134198009
by changes|243326001|263703002
in pilosebaceous units,|33416008
skin structures|39937001
consisting
of a hair follicle|67290009|280830006
and
its associated sebaceous gland,|47429007|1028005
changes|243326001|263703002
that
require
androgen stimulation.|66349002|122545008

Acne|88616000|11381005
occurs|272120004
most commonly
during adolescence,|22396007
and
often|70232002
continues|255238004
into adulthood.|41847000

In adolescence,|22396007
acne|88616000|11381005
is
usually
caused|23981006|134198009
by an increase|260366006
in testosterone,|43688007|85470006
which
accrues
during puberty,|18991001
regardless of sex.|258139002|365952006|263495000|70256003|57312000

For most people,|125676002
acne diminishes|88616000|1250004|11381005|1250004
over time|410669006
and
tends
to
disappear ?
or
at the very least decreases ?|260358002|260370003
by age 25.|424144002

There
is
,
however,
no way to
predict
how long|255511005
it
will
take|419652001
to
disappear
entirely,
and
some individuals|125676002|385435006
will
carry|288345009
this condition well|260905004|20572008
into their thirties,
forties,
and
beyond.[5]|264706000|264605009

Some
of the large nodules|255509001|27925004|255509001|279365004
were
previously
called
"cysts"|441457006
and
the term _nodulocystic_
has
been
used|394850002
to
describe
severe cases|24484000|398241000|24484000|413769002
of inflammatory acne.|428101005

The "cysts,|441457006
"
or
boils|416675009
that accompany cystic acne,|13277001
can
appear
on the buttocks,|46862004
groin,|255575008
and
armpit area,|422543003|42798000|361288001|42798000
and
anywhere else
where
sweat|74616000|161857006
collects
in hair follicles|67290009
and
perspiration ducts.|74616000|343011009|161857006|343011009

Cystic acne|13277001
affects|4065008
deeper skin tissue|131197000|314818000
than
does
common acne.[8]|88616000

Aside from scarring,|275322007
its main effects|63161005|253861007
are
psychological,|60224009
such as reduced self-esteem[9]|260400001|247891008
and
in very extreme cases,|260358002|12565001|398241000|260358002|12565001|413769002
depression|35489007|366979004|255339005
or
suicide.|44301001

Acne usually|88616000|11381005
appears
during adolescence,|22396007
when
people already|125676002
tend
to
be
most socially insecure.|54038000

Early|264499004
and
aggressive treatment|61372001|276239002|61372001|416118004|276239002|416118004
is
therefore
advocated
by some to
lessen
the overall long-term impact|134293005
to individuals.[9]|125676002|385435006

The term _acne_|88616000|11381005
comes
from a mutation|55446002
of the Greek ????|1451003
(_akm?_
)
,
literally "point,
edge",|57183005
but
in the sense|106148006
of a "skin eruption"[11]|271807003
in the writings
of A?tius Amidenus.

Used|394850002
by itself,
the term "acne" refers|88616000|439980006|11381005|439980006
to the presence|386397008
of pustules|271760008
and
papules.|443871003

The most common form|4757001|72906007|246176004
of acne|88616000|11381005
is
known|36692007
as acne vulgaris,|88616000
meaning|255586005
"common acne".|88616000

Many teenagers|260396001|133937008
get
this type|261664005
of acne.|88616000|11381005

Use|277889008|419385000
of the term "acne vulgaris"|88616000
implies
the presence|386397008
of comedones.[13]|247467008

The term "acne rosacea"|398909004
is
a synonym
for rosacea,|398909004
however
some individuals|125676002|385435006
may
have
almost
no acne comedones|88616000|247467008|11381005|247467008
associated|47429007
with their rosacea|398909004
and
therefore
prefer|225773000
the term rosacea.|398909004

Chloracne|83684005
is
associated|47429007
with exposure|71677004|24932003
to polyhalogenated compounds.|62105006

Typical features
of acne|88616000|11381005
include|55919000
:
seborrhea|86708008
(increased oil-sebum secretion|35105006|21847005|53701004|35105006|421890007|53701004|260366006|21847005|53701004|260366006|421890007|53701004
)
,
comedones|247467008
(blackheads|271763005
and
whiteheads|247468003
)
,
papules|443871003
(pinheads
)
,
pustules|271760008
(pimples,|103605005
nodules|27925004|279365004
(large papules|255509001|443871003
)
and
,
possibly scarring.|60022001|60022001|275322007

The appearance|386548000|255412001
of acne|88616000|11381005
varies
with skin color.|276323006|364533002

Acne scars|247459000
are
the result|394617004
of inflammation|257552002
within the dermis|53534000
brought|68369002
on
by acne.|88616000|11381005

The scar|70582006|275322007
is
created
by the wound trying|13924000
to heal|298005009
itself
resulting|42752001
in too
much collagen|61472002
in one spot.[15]|421379005|23840004

Physical acne scars|5880005|247459000|19388002|247459000
are
often|70232002
referred to|439980006
as
"Icepick" scars.|403361008

This
is
because
the scars|70582006|275322007
tend
to
cause|23981006|134198009
an indentation|82448003
in the skin's surface.|119325001|410678000|39937001|410678000|181469002|410678000

There
are
a range
of treatments|276239002
available.|103328004

Although
quite rare,|84638005|103356009
the medical condition Atrophia Maculosa Varioliformis Cutis also|74188005|260905004|238841008
results|394617004
in "acne-|88616000|11381005
like" depressed scars|366979004|70582006|366979004|275322007
on the face.|89545001|302549007

Pigmented scars|239174004
is
a slightly|425404009
misleading
term,
as
it
suggests
a change|243326001|263703002
in the skin's pigmentation|38962007|370172004
and
that
they
are
true scars|31874001|70582006|31874001|275322007
;
however,
neither
is
true.|31874001

Pigmented scars|239174004
are
usually
the result|394617004
of nodular|255288007
or
cystic acne|13277001
(
the painful '|22253000
bumps
' lying|40199007|255576009
under the skin|119325001|39937001|181469002
).

They often|70232002
leave|7771000|90737002
behind an inflamed red mark.|386713009|46998006|371240000|46998006

Often,|70232002
the pigmentation scars|263839000|70582006|263839000|275322007
can
be
avoided
simply
by avoiding aggravation
of the nodule|27925004
or
cyst.|441457006|103552005

Pigmentation|263839000
scars|70582006|275322007
nearly always
fade
with time taking|410669006
between three months|421291004|258706009
to two years to do so,|420797005|258707000
although
can
last
indefinitely
if
untreated.|25265005

A severe case|24484000|398241000
of cystic acne|13277001

Cystic acne|13277001

Different types|263735002|261664005
of Acne Vulgaris|88616000
:

Acne|88616000|11381005
develops
as a result|394617004
of blockages
in the follicles.|24162005|67290009

Hyperkeratinization
and
formation|11798007|255277001
of a plug|303480007
of keratin|259987000|102665003
and
sebum|51280008
(
a microcomedo
is
the earliest change.|264499004|243326001|264499004|263703002

Enlargement|56246009|118452000|442021009
of sebaceous glands|1028005
and
an increase|260366006
in sebum production|51280008
occur|272120004
with increased androgen|35105006|66349002|260366006|66349002
(DHEA-S production|413963008|104624004
at adrenarche.|103020000

The microcomedo
may
enlarge|260376009|118452000
to
form|246176004
an open comedone|271763005
(blackhead|271763005
or
closed comedone|247468003
(milia|254679001
).

Comedones|247467008
are
the direct result|255589003|394617004
of sebaceous glands'|1028005
becoming
clogged
with sebum,|51280008
a naturally
occurring|272120004
oil,|21847005|421890007
and
dead skin cells.|419620001|314819008

In these conditions,|260905004
the naturally
occurring|272120004
largely commensal bacterium _Propionibacterium acnes_|284685002|409822003|39473003
can
cause|23981006|134198009
inflammation,|257552002
leading|236874000
to inflammatory lesions
(papules,|443871003
infected pustules,|271760008
or
nodules|27925004|279365004
)
in the dermis|53534000
around the microcomedo
or
comedone,|247467008
which
results|394617004
in redness|386713009|371240000
and
may
result|394617004
in scarring|275322007
or
hyperpigmentation.[16]|49765009

Hormonal activity,|176375003
such as menstrual cycles|78456001
and
puberty,|18991001
may
contribute
to the formation|11798007|255277001
of acne.|88616000|11381005

During puberty,|18991001
an increase|260366006
in male sex hormones
called
androgens|66349002
cause|23981006|134198009
the follicular glands to|255285005|362884007
grow
larger|255509001|263768009
and
make
more sebum.|242762006|51280008

Use|277889008|419385000
of anabolic steroids|111151007
may
have
a similar effect.|253861007

Several hormones|261028005|87568004
have
been
linked
to acne|88616000|11381005
:
the androgens testosterone,|66349002|43688007|66349002|85470006
dihydrotestosterone (DHT)|103042004|413993002
and
dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS),|103044003
as well as
insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-I).|5699003|79104007

Development|278923009
of acne vulgaris|88616000
in later years|260383002|258707000
is
uncommon,|103356009
although
this
is
the age group|424144002|261586004|424144002|160481000|424144002|389109008
for rosacea,|398909004
which
may
have
similar appearances.|255412001

True acne vulgaris|31874001|88616000
in adult women|133936004|224526002
may
be
a feature
of an underlying condition|260905004
such as pregnancy|289908002
and
disorders|64572001
such as polycystic ovary syndrome|69878008
or
the rare Cushing's syndrome.|84638005|103356009

Menopause-associated acne|161712005|47429007|88616000|161712005|47429007|11381005
occurs|272120004
as production
of the natural anti-acne ovarian hormone estradiol|510009|88616000|43171004|126172005|510009|11381005|43171004|126172005
fails
at menopause.|161712005

The lack|41277001
of estradiol also|126172005
causes|134198009
thinning hair,|278040002
hot flushes,|427368007
thin skin,|277797007
wrinkles,|247434009
vaginal dryness,|31908003
and
predisposes
to osteopenia|312894000
and
osteoporosis|64859006
as well as
triggering acne|88616000|11381005|410658008|88616000|410658008|11381005
(
known|36692007
as acne climacterica|88616000|11381005
in this situation
).

The tendency to
develop
acne|88616000|11381005
runs|282476009
in families.|35359004

For example,
school aged boys|257698009|424144002|433152004|257698009|105436006|433152004
with acne often|88616000|70232002|11381005|70232002
have
other members|74964007|394852005
in their family|35359004
with acne.|88616000|11381005

A family history|57177007
of acne|88616000|11381005
is
associated|47429007
with an earlier occurrence|264499004|272120004
of acne|88616000|11381005
and
an increased number|35105006|410680006|35105006|410681005|260366006|410680006|260366006|410681005
of retentional acne lesions.[19]|88616000|11381005

While
the connection|263538003

Benzoyl peroxide|91598004
is
a first-line treatment|255216001|50009006|276239002|255216001|50009006|416118004|232714002|50009006|276239002|232714002|50009006|416118004
for mild|255604002
and
moderate acne vulgaris|6736007|88616000
due to its effectiveness|255403003
and
mild side-effects|255604002
(primarily
an irritant dermatitis.|110979008

It
works|261041009
against the "P.|20304007

acnes" bacterium,|88616000|409822003|11381005|409822003

and
occasional peeling|84638005|257890000|84638005|51979000
when
side effects
occur.|272120004

This topical|359540000

increase sensitivity|260366006|35209006|260366006|365705006
to the sun|49926000

sunscreen|373498003
should
be
used|394850002
during the treatment to|276239002|416118004

sunburn.|23346002

Benzoyl peroxide|91598004
has
been
found|404684003
to
be
nearly
as effective|255403003|254648000
as antibiotics|255631004

5.0%,|264706000|264605009
and
10% equally effective.|255403003|254648000

Unlike antibiotics,|255631004
benzoyl peroxide|91598004
does
not
appear
to

bacterial resistance.[31]|71219004|264664006

Sometimes benzoyl peroxide topical medication|91598004|410942007|91598004|359540000|410942007

the antiandrogen cyproterone|103024009|126119006
in combination|89780004
with an oestrogen|61946003
(_Diane 35_
)
is
particularly effective|255403003|254648000
at reducing androgenic hormone levels.|260400001|66349002|365774006

Diane-35
is
not available|103328004
in the USA,|223688001
but
a newer oral contraceptive|7147002|423938009|7147002|5935008
containing|42504009
the progestin drospirenone|20249007|410919000
is
now available|103328004
with fewer side effects|57176003
than Diane 35 / Dianette.

Both
can
be
used|394850002
where blood tests|252275004
show
abnormally high levels|371879000|258395000
of androgens,|66349002
but
are
effective even|255403003|254648000
when
this
is
not
the case.|398241000

Along
with this,
treatment|276239002|416118004
with low-dose spironolactone|262459003|387078006
can
have

(Retin-A|387305002
)
,
adapalene|386934008
(Differin
)
,
and
tazarotene|386935009
(Tazorac
).

Like isotretinoin,|429464002
they
are
related|272151006|262094002
to vitamin A,|82622003
but
they
are
administered|418283001
topically
and
they generally
have
much milder side effects.|255604002

They
can
,
however,
cause|23981006|134198009
significant irritation|386134007|257553007
of the skin.|119325001|39937001|181469002

The retinoids|372579009
appear
to
influence
the cell life cycle|4421005|224130005|44180009|362837007|224130005|44180009
in the follicle lining.|24162005|50009006|67290009|50009006

This
helps
prevent
the hyperkeratinization
of these cells|4421005
that
can
create
a blockage.

Retinol,|82622003|76609004
a form|246176004
of vitamin A,|82622003
has
similar,
but
milder,|255604002
effects|253861007

as the other topical treatments.|74964007|276239002|74964007|359540000|276239002

Topical retinoids often|372579009|70232002|359540000|372579009|70232002
cause|23981006|134198009
an initial flare-up|884001|255532002|884001|353734004|232714002|255532002|232714002|353734004

and
facial flushing.|271811009

A daily oral intake|69620002|260548002
of vitamin A derivative isotretinoin|82622003|429464002|429464002
(
marketed|284440009
as Roaccutane,
Accutane,

Clarus
)
over a period|259037005
of 4?6 months|260308009|258706009

cause|23981006|134198009
long-term resolution
or
reduction|58294000|260400001|289928003
of acne.|88616000|11381005

It
is
believed
that isotretinoin|429464002
works|261041009
primarily
by reducing|260400001
the secretion|46242002
of oils|21847005
from the glands,|362884007
but
some studies|110465008|224699009
suggest
that
it
affects|4065008
other acne-related factors|272151006|262094002
as well.|20572008

Isotretinoin|429464002
has
been
shown
to
be
very effective|260358002|255403003|260358002|254648000
in treating severe acne|28995006|24484000|88616000|28995006|24484000|11381005
and
can
either
improve|385425000|3442003|385633008
or
clear|263707001
well over 80%|20572008|21481007
of patients.|116154003

The drug|410942007
has
a much longer effect|242762006|255511005|253861007|4757001|255511005|253861007
than antibacterial treatments|419241000|276239002
and
will
often|70232002
cure
acne|88616000|11381005
for good.|20572008

The treatment|276239002|416118004
requires
close medical supervision|225312004|74188005
by a dermatologist|18803008
because
the drug|410942007
has
many known side effects|36692007
(many|260396001
of which
can
be
severe|24484000
).

About 25%
of patients|116154003
relapse|263855007|255318003|58184002

for another 4?6 months|260308009|258706009
may
be
indicated|410535002
to
obtain|398092000
desired results.|394617004

It
is
often|70232002

let
a few months|57176003|258706009
pass
between the two treatments,|420797005|276239002
because
the condition|260905004
can
actually
improve|385425000|3442003|385633008
somewhat
in the time|410669006
after stopping|260890000|385654001|422117008
the treatment|276239002|416118004
and
waiting
a few months also|57176003|258706009
gives|419582001
the body|279495008|123037004
a chance to
recover.|74822006

On occasion,|84638005
a third|70905002
or
even
a fourth course|29970001|288524001
is
used,|394850002
but
the benefits
are
often less substantial.|70232002

The most common side effects|4757001|72906007
are
dry skin|16386004
and
occasional nosebleeds|84638005|12441001
(secondary to|2603003
dry|13880007
nasal mucosa|34508005|310211009
).

Oral retinoids also often|260548002|372579009|70232002
cause|23981006|134198009
an initial flare-up|884001|255532002|884001|353734004|232714002|255532002|232714002|353734004
of acne|88616000|11381005
within a month|258706009|259036001
or
so,|223528007
which
can
be
severe.|24484000

There
are
reports|229059009|223458004
that
the drug|410942007
has
damaged|37782003
the liver|10200004|181268008
of patients.|116154003

For this reason,|410666004
it
is
recommended
that patients|116154003
have
blood samples|119297000
taken|419652001
and
examined|64049009
before
and
during treatment.|276239002|416118004

In some cases,|398241000|413769002
treatment|276239002|416118004
is
terminated|58322009
or
reduced|260400001
due to elevated liver enzymes|75540009|259670004|75540009|365769003
in the blood,|87612001|119273009
which
might
be
related|272151006|262094002
to liver damage.|243978007

Others|74964007
claim
that
the reports|229059009|223458004
of permanent damage|6934004|37782003
to the liver|10200004|181268008
are
unsubstantiated
,
and
routine testing|50811001|50811001|272393004
is
considered unnecessary
by some dermatologists.|18803008

Blood triglycerides also|87612001|85600001|119273009|85600001
need|410525008|103325001
to
be
monitored.|302805002|13288007

However,
routine testing|50811001|50811001|272393004
is
part|260726005
of the official guidelines
for the use|277889008|419385000
of the drug|410942007
in many countries.|223369002

Some press
reports|229059009|223458004
_[weasel words_]|388537002|255373000
suggest
that isotretinoin|429464002
may
cause|23981006|134198009
depression,|35489007|366979004|255339005
but
,
as of September 2005,
there
is
no agreement
in the medical literature|74188005
as to the risk.|30207005

The drug also|410942007
causes|134198009
birth defects|276654001
if
women|224526002
become
pregnant|77386006|127362006
while
taking
it
or
take|419652001
it
while
pregnant.|77386006|127362006

For this reason,|410666004
female patients|248152002|116154003|224526002|116154003
are
required
to
use|277889008|419385000
two separate forms|420797005|263869007|246176004
of birth control|13197004
or
vow abstinence|105542008
while
on the drug.|410942007

Because of this,
the drug|410942007
is
supposed to
be
given|419582001
to females|248152002
as a last resort
after milder treatments|255604002|276239002
have
proven insufficient.|277025001|71978007|277025001|423437008

Restrictive rules|10828004
(
see|281004000
iPledge program
)
for use|277889008|419385000
were
put
into force|285653008
in the USA beginning|223688001|255395001
in March 2006 to
prevent
misuse,
causing|23981006
occasioned widespread editorial comment.[32]|85333001

Nicotinamide,|63639004|173196005|105259002
(vitamin B3|173196005
)
used|394850002
topically
in the form|246176004
of a gel,|385100002
has
been
shown
in a 1995 study to|110465008|224699009
be
of comparable efficacy
to topical clindamycin|350152005
used|394850002
for comparison.

The benefit
of topical nicotinamide|63639004|173196005|105259002|359540000|63639004|359540000|173196005|359540000|105259002
seems
to
lie|40199007|255576009
in its anti-inflammatory nature.|330901000|277302009

It
is
also
purported
to
result|394617004
in increased synthesis|35105006|11798007|260366006|11798007
of collagen,|61472002
keratin,|259987000|102665003
involucrin
and
flaggrin.

According to a cosmetic company,|81024003|261513001
it
may
be
useful
for reducing skin hyperpigmentation|260400001|49765009
(dark acne marks|255419005|88616000|46998006|255419005|11381005|46998006
)
,
increasing|260369004
skin moisture|16514006
and
reducing fine wrinkles.[34].|260400001|3082000|247434009

Topical clindamycin|350152005
is
used to|394850002
treat|395077000
acne.|88616000|11381005

Clindamycin|372786004
is
in a class|258391009
of medications|410942007
called
lincomycin antibiotics.|372677003|255631004

It
works|261041009
by slowing|419443000
or
stopping|260890000|385654001|422117008
the growth
of bacteria|409822003
that cause acne|134198009|88616000|134198009|11381005
and
by decreasing swelling.|260371004|423666004|260371004|442672001

It
is
only
for use|277889008|419385000
on the skin.|119325001|39937001|181469002

Clindamycin|372786004
should
be
applied|410618006
to freshly cleansed skin|119325001|39937001|181469002
;
it
is
best to|20572008|3442003
wait
2-5 minutes|264655001|258701004|264655001|255507004|264655001|356624006
after cleansing to
apply|410618006|417924000
the product.

Once
applied|410618006
,
it
is
beneficial to
wait
2-5 minutes|264655001|258701004|264655001|255507004|264655001|356624006
before applying moisturizer,|410618006|417924000
sunscreen,|373498003
or
makeup.

This
will
allow
the product
to adequately
absorb
into the skin|119325001|39937001|181469002
for maximum benefits.|398303009

Additionally,
an oil-free, non-comedogenic moisturizer|21847005|37837009|421890007|37837009
or
sunscreen|373498003
should
be
applied|410618006
after the clindamycin.|372786004

Ibuprofen|387207008
is
used|394850002
in combination|89780004
with tetracycline[36]|372809001|16355005|282831004
for some moderate acne cases.|6736007|88616000|398241000|6736007|88616000|413769002|6736007|11381005|398241000|6736007|11381005|413769002

Mandelic acid|395778000
has
been
noted
to
be
an effective topical treatment|255403003|276239002|255403003|416118004|255403003|359540000|276239002|255403003|359540000|416118004|254648000|276239002|254648000|416118004|254648000|359540000|276239002|254648000|359540000|416118004
for mild to moderate acne.|371923003|88616000|371923003|11381005

It
is
considered to
be
a gentler alternative
to popular alpha hydroxy acids|263660008|34957004
such as glycolic acid|115383003|45737001
and
lactic acid.[37]|77370004

Dermabrasion|37236007
is
a cosmetic medical procedure|261513001|74188005|81024003|50731006|261513001|50731006
in which
the surface|410678000
of the skin|119325001|39937001|181469002
is
removed|127485006
by abrasion|262536007|8420001|399963005
(sanding|128489003
).

It
is
used to|394850002
remove|127485006
sun-damaged skin|49926000|37782003|119325001|49926000|37782003|39937001|49926000|37782003|181469002
and
to
remove|127485006
or
lessen scars|70582006|275322007
and
dark spots|255419005|271807003|255419005|285305004
on the skin.|119325001|39937001|181469002

The procedure|71388002
is
very painful|260358002|22253000
and
usually
requires
a general anaesthetic|50697003|373288007
or
"twilight anaesthesia",|399097000|394577000|33653009
in which
the patient|116154003
is
still partly conscious.

Afterward,
the skin|119325001|39937001|181469002
is
very red|260358002|386713009|260358002|371240000
and
raw-looking,|6304003|386548000
and
it
takes|419652001
several months|261028005|258706009
for the skin to|119325001|39937001|181469002
regrow
and
heal.|298005009

Dermabrasion|37236007
is
useful
for scar removal|446295000
when
the scar|70582006|275322007
is
raised|260399008
above the surrounding skin,|355648006|119325001|355648006|39937001|355648006|181469002
but
is
less effective|276139006|255403003|276139006|254648000|263796003|255403003|263796003|254648000
with sunken scars.|70582006|275322007

In the past,|410513005
dermabrasion|37236007
was
done
using|260676000
a small,|255507004
sterilized
,
electric sander.|18213006

In the past decade,|410513005
it
has
become
more common to|242762006|72906007
use|277889008|419385000
laser dermabrasion|122456005|37236007|38586004|37236007
using|260676000
CO2,|421982008|38007001
Er:YAG laser|118306008
or
a combination|89780004
of both
for the treatment|276239002|416118004
of acne scars.|247459000

Indications|410666004
for CO2 laser treatment|118312003|276239002|118312003|416118004
include|55919000
previous non erythematous|9130008|444827008
and
non-proliferative hypertrophic scars,|30217000|19843006
atrophic acne scars|403360009
and
burn scars.|403193008

Laser dermabrasion|122456005|37236007|38586004|37236007
is
much easier to|242762006|36203004|4757001|36203004
control|31509003
,
much easier|242762006|36203004|4757001|36203004
to gauge,|277245004
and
is
practically bloodless|87612001|119273009|32873005
compared
to classic dermabrasion.|255301002|37236007|255333006|37236007

Light exposure|56242006|71677004|56242006|24932003|371268001|71677004|371268001|24932003
has
long|255511005
been
used|394850002
as a short-term treatment|276239002|416118004
for acne.|88616000|11381005

Recently,|6493001
visible light|75184002
has
been
successfully
employed|224363007
to
treat|395077000
mild to moderate acne|371923003|88616000|371923003|11381005
(phototherapy|31394004
or
deep penetrating light therapy -|131197000|53568006|31394004
in particular intense violet light|103370009|13944006|56242006|103370009|13944006|371268001
(405?420 nm)
generated
by purpose-built fluorescent lighting,|363675004|35352008|56242006
dichroic bulbs,|228657002
LEDs
or
lasers.|122456005

Used|394850002
twice weekly,|229800002
this
has
been
shown
to
reduce|260400001
the number|410680006|410681005
of acne|88616000|11381005
lesions
by about 64%[39]
and
is
even more effective|255403003|254648000
when
applied|410618006
daily.|69620002

The mechanism|257544000
appears
to
be
that
a porphyrin|15730005
(Coproporphyrin III|102755001
)
produced
within _P.|20304007

acnes_|88616000|11381005
generates
free radicals|39265005
when
irradiated|108290001
by 420 nm
and
shorter wavelengths|359530003|246522008|367450005|246522008
of light.|56242006|371268001

Particularly
when
applied|410618006
over several days,|261028005|258703001
these free radicals ultimately|39265005
kill|248007002
the bacteria.|409822003

Since
porphyrins|15730005
are
not otherwise
present|52101004|246105001
in skin,|119325001|39937001|181469002
and
no UV light|41355003
is
employed,|224363007
it
appears
to
be
safe,
and
has
been
cleared|84989007
for marketing
by the U.S.|223688001
FDA.[42][43]

It
seems
that
the treatment|276239002|416118004
works|261041009
even better|3442003
if
used|394850002
with a mixture|272163001
of the violet light|13944006|56242006|13944006|371268001
and
red visible light|285330001|24054004|386713009|75184002|371240000|75184002
(660 nanometer|258675004
)
,
resulting|42752001
in a 76% reduction|58294000|260400001|289928003
of lesions
after three months|421291004|258706009
of daily treatment|69620002|276239002|69620002|416118004
for 80%
of the patients|116154003
;[44]
and
overall clearance|260695007
was
similar
or
better|3442003
than benzoyl peroxide.|91598004

Unlike most
of the other treatments,|74964007|276239002
few
if
any negative side-effects|260385009
are
typically
experienced
,
and
the development|278923009
of bacterial resistance|71219004
to the treatment|276239002|416118004
seems
very unlikely.|260358002

After treatment,|276239002|416118004
clearance|260695007
can
be
longer-lived|255511005|224130005|255511005|419749002
than
is
typical
with topical|359540000
or
oral antibiotic treatments|260548002|255631004|276239002
;
several months|261028005|258706009
is
not uncommon.|103356009

The equipment|246137000
or
treatment,|276239002|416118004
however,
is
relatively new|7147002
and
reasonably expensive to buy initially,|884001
although
the total cost|258755000|255619001
of ownership
can
be
similar
to many other treatment methods|272394005|276239002|272394005|416118004
(
such as the total cost|258755000|255619001
of benzoyl peroxide,|91598004
moisturizer,
washes
)
over a couple
of years|258707000
of use.|277889008|419385000

In addition,|260364009
basic science|418836005
and
clinical work|58147004|261041009
by dermatologists Yoram Harth|18803008
and
Alan Shalita
and
others|74964007
have
produced evidence|18669006
that intense blue/violet light|103370009|285331002|13944006
(405?425 nanometer|258675004
)
can
decrease|260400001|260370003
the number|410680006|410681005
of inflammatory acne lesion|428101005
by 60?70%
in four weeks|421534005|258705008
of therapy,|276239002
in particular,
when
the _P.|20304007

acnes_|88616000|11381005
is
pretreated
with delta-aminolevulinic acid (ALA),|409398000
which
increases|260366006
the production
of porphyrins.|15730005

However
this photodynamic therapy|257891001
is
controversial
and
not
published
in a peer-reviewed journal.|386387004|433497004

A phase II trial,|21191007|110465008
while
it
showed
improvement
occurred|272120004
,
failed
to
show
improved response|385425000|3442003
compared
to the blue/violet light alone.[45]|285331002|13944006|105529008

In May 2012 Photocure
announced
a successful fase IIb study|385669000|110465008|385669000|224699009
with Visonac.

Visonac
is
intended to|361269008
treat|395077000
moderate|6736007
to severe acne.|24484000|88616000|24484000|11381005

Visonac
combines|20909006
the application|410618006
of Visonac cream|255621006|385099005
with the active ingredient methyl aminolevulinate 80 mg/g|127489000|409397005|427264006|258795003
and
controlled illumination|31509003|56242006|31509003|410460000
by a red light source.|285330001|260753009

Visonac
showed
a statistically significant reduction|386134007|58294000|386134007|260400001|386134007|289928003
in inflammatory lesions
and
overall improvement
in acne severity.|88616000|272141005|11381005|272141005

Visonac
is
expected to
enter|417985001
phase III early|21191007|257471003|264499004
in 2013.

Visonac
is
based|418836005
on the accumulation
of a photosensitizer|373212004
in the target cells|259686006
that
upon illumination|56242006|410460000
generate
reactive oxygen species,|11214006|24099007|69658003
killing|248007002
the cells.|4421005

The mechanism|257544000
of action|129264002
appears
to
involve|248448006
killing|248007002
of bacteria|409822003
as well as
specific action|69658003|129264002
on sebaceous glands|1028005
and
inflammatory cells.|256923004

The Visonac cream|255621006|385099005
is
applied|410618006
to the acne area,|88616000|42798000|11381005|42798000
and
after a short incubation time,|359530003|410669006|367450005|410669006
the skin|119325001|39937001|181469002
is
illuminated
with a red light dose|285330001|277406006|285330001|408102007
of 37J/cm2.[47]|259022006|373587001

Laser surgery|35631009
has
been
in use|52101004|277889008|52101004|419385000|18720000|277889008|18720000|419385000
for some time to|410669006
reduce|260400001
the scars|70582006|275322007
left|7771000
behind
by acne,|88616000|11381005
[48]
but
research
has
been
done
on lasers|122456005
for prevention|169443000
of acne formation|88616000|11798007|88616000|255277001|11381005|11798007|11381005|255277001
itself.

The laser|122456005|38586004
is
used to|394850002
produce
one|421379005
of the following effects|255260001|253861007
:

Since
lasers|122456005
and
intense pulsed light sources|103370009|410194008|56242006|260753009|103370009|410194008|371268001|260753009|103370009|78564009|56242006|260753009|103370009|78564009|371268001|260753009|103370009|8499008|56242006|260753009|103370009|8499008|371268001|260753009
cause|23981006|134198009
thermal damage|37782003
to the skin,|119325001|39937001|181469002
there
are
concerns
that laser|122456005|38586004
or
intense pulsed light treatments|103370009|410194008|56242006|276239002|103370009|410194008|371268001|276239002|103370009|78564009|56242006|276239002|103370009|78564009|371268001|276239002|103370009|8499008|56242006|276239002|103370009|8499008|371268001|276239002
for acne|88616000|11381005
will
induce|16404004
hyperpigmented macules|112629002
(spots|271807003|285305004
)
or
cause|23981006|134198009
long-term dryness|13880007
of the skin.|119325001|39937001|181469002

The FDA
has
approved|9571008
the use|277889008|419385000
of a cosmetic laser|81024003|122456005|81024003|38586004|261513001|122456005|261513001|38586004
for the treatment|276239002|416118004
of acne.|88616000|11381005

However,
efficacy studies|110465008|224699009
have
used|394850002
very small sample|260358002|255507004|123038009
sizes|277049003
for periods|259037005
of six months|422218008|258706009
or
less,|276139006|263796003
and
have
shown
contradictory results.|394617004

Also,
laser treatment|122456005|276239002|122456005|416118004|38586004|276239002|38586004|416118004
being
relatively new, protocols|7147002|258049002
remain
subject to experimentation
and
revision,|255231005|118635009|261560009
[50]
and
treatment|276239002|416118004
can
be
quite expensive.

Also,
some Smoothbeam laser devices|122456005
had
to
be
recalled
due to coolant failure,|76797004
which
resulted|42752001|394617004
in painful burn injuries|22253000|125666000
to patients.[51]|116154003

For people|125676002
with cystic acne,|13277001
boils|416675009
can
be
drained|32712000
through surgical lancing.[8]|83578000|102338002

Alternative medicine|350084001
for acne generally|88616000|11381005
claims
to

the blood|87612001|119273009
of toxins,|80917008
increase immunity,|260366006|58915005

Acne usually|88616000|11381005
improves|385425000|3442003|385633008
around the age|424144002
of 20
but
may
persist
into adulthood.[30]|41847000

successfully
in mice,|447612001|447482001
