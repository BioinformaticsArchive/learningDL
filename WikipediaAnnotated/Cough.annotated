is
a sudden|255363002
and
often repetitively|70232002
occurring|272120004
reflex|87572000|106146005
which
helps
to
clear|263707001
the large breathing passages|255509001|89187006
from secretions,|46242002
irritants,|412453003
foreign particles
and
microbes.|264395009

The cough reflex|34606001
consists
of three phases|421291004|272108007
:
an inhalation,|14910006|422237004
a forced exhalation|58322009|263760002|58322009
against a closed glottis,|29179001|1307006|29179001|264482000
and
a violent release|58000006|68776005|258760001|129299003|115956009
of air|417696007
from the lungs|39607008
following|255260001
opening|56116003
of the glottis,|1307006|264482000
usually
accompanied
by a distinctive sound.|68325009

Coughing|272039006
can
happen voluntarily
as well as
involuntarily.

Frequent coughing usually|70232002|272039006
indicates|410535002
the presence|386397008
of a disease.|64572001

Many viruses|260396001|49872002
and
bacteria|409822003
benefit
evolutionarily
by causing|23981006
the host to
cough|272039006
,
which
helps
to
spread|410677005
the disease|64572001
to new hosts.|7147002

Most
of the time,|410669006
coughing|272039006
is
caused|23981006|134198009
by a respiratory tract infection|275498002
but
can
be
triggered|410658008
by choking,|249489001
smoking|365981007
,
air pollution,|102413006
[1] asthma,|260305007|195967001
gastroesophageal reflux disease,|235595009
post-nasal drip,|75803007
chronic bronchitis,|63480004
lung tumors,|126713003
heart failure|84114007|42343007
and
medications|410942007
such as ACE inhibitors.|372733002

Treatment|276239002|416118004
should
target
the cause|134198009
;
for example,
smoking|365981007
cessation
or
discontinuing ACE inhibitors.|410546004|372733002|421286000|372733002

Some people|125676002
may
be
worried|79015004
about serious illnesses,|42745003|39104002
and
reassurance|79441000
may
suffice.

Cough suppressants|372791003
such as codeine|387494007|105142004
or
dextromethorphan|387114001
are
frequently|70232002
prescribed
,
but
have
been
demonstrated
to
have
little effect.|253861007

Other treatment options|74964007|276239002|74964007|416118004
may
target
airway inflammation|43725001|257552002|89187006|257552002
or
may
promote
mucus expectoration.|49909006|45710003

As
it
is
a natural protective reflex,|510009|87572000|510009|106146005
suppressing|245780008
the cough reflex|34606001
might
have
damaging effects,|253861007
especially
if
the cough|272039006
is
productive.[2]

A cough|272039006
can
be
classified|73504009
by its duration,|103335007
character,
quality,|263496004
and
timing.|246512002

The duration|103335007
can
be
either
acute|272118002
(
of sudden onset|385315009|255363002
)
if
it
is
present|52101004|246105001
less
than three weeks,|421291004|258705008
subacute|19939008
if
it
is
present|52101004|246105001
between three|421291004
and
eight weeks,|421825006|258705008
and
chronic|90734009
when
lasting
longer|255511005
than eight weeks.|421825006|258705008

A cough|272039006
can
be
non-productive
(dry|13880007
)
or
productive
(
when
sputum|45710003
is
coughed|272039006|289114008
up
).

It
may
occur|272120004
only
at night|2546009
(then
called _nocturnal cough_|62548007
)
,
during
both
night|2546009
and
day,|258703001|259032004
or
just
during the day.[3]|258703001|259032004

A number|410680006|410681005
of characteristic coughs|272039006|289114008
exist.

While
these
have
not
been
found|404684003
to
be
diagnostically useful
in adults,|133936004
they
are
of use|277889008|419385000
in children.|410601007|160499008

A barky cough|17986004
is
part|260726005
of the common presentation|72906007|246105001
of croup,|71186008
[4]|260308009
while
a staccato cough|272039006
has
been
classically
described
with chlamydia pneumonia.[5]|103514009

A cough|272039006
in children|410601007|160499008
may
be
either
a normal physiological reflex|102981005|1360005
or
due to an underlying cause.|134198009

In healthy children|102506008
it
may
be
normal|17621005|258744000
in the absence|2667000|418560003
of any disease to|64572001
cough|272039006
ten|23067006|420258001
times a day.|258703001|259032004

The most common cause|4757001|72906007|134198009
of an acute|272118002
or
subacute cough|19939008|272039006
is
a viral respiratory tract infection.|275498002|312133006

In adults|133936004
with a chronic cough,|68154008
i.e.|42146005|22971001

a cough|272039006
longer|255511005
than 8 weeks,|258705008
more
than 90%|264705001|264703008
of cases|398241000|413769002
are
due to post-nasal drip,|75803007
asthma,|195967001
eosinophilic bronchitis,|32398004|14793004|32398004|365601007|32398004|191357009|32398004|419455006|32398004|419769007|32398004
and
gastroesophageal reflux disease.|235595009

The causes|134198009
of chronic cough|68154008
are
similar
in children|410601007|160499008
with the addition|260364009
of bacterial bronchitis.[3]|65878001

A cough|272039006
can
be
the result|394617004
of a respiratory tract infection|275498002
such as the common cold,|82272006|54150009
pneumonia,|205237003
pertussis,|27836007
or
tuberculosis.|371569005

In the vast majority
of cases,|398241000|413769002
acute coughs,|272118002|272039006|272118002|289114008
i.e.|42146005|22971001

coughs|272039006|289114008
shorter|359530003|367450005
than 3 weeks,|260313008|258705008
are
due to the common cold.|82272006|54150009

In people|125676002
with a normal chest X-ray,|168733007
tuberculosis|371569005
is
a rare finding.|84638005|404684003|84638005|103356009|404684003|103356009

Pertussis|27836007
is
increasingly
being
recognised
as a cause|134198009
of troublesome coughing|272039006
in adults.|133936004

After a viral infection|34014006
has
cleared|84989007
,
the person|125676002
may
be
left|7771000
with a postinfectious cough.|272039006

This typically
is
a dry, non-productive cough|13880007|409596002
that
produces
no phlegm.|52024008

Symptoms
may
include|55919000
a tightness|255365009
in the chest,|261179002
and
a tickle|255364008
in the lungs.|39607008

This cough|272039006
may
often|70232002
persist
for weeks|258705008
after an illness._[citation|39104002
needed|410525008|103325001
_]
The cause|134198009
of the cough|272039006
may
be
inflammation|257552002
similar
to that
observed
in repetitive stress disorders|262188008|64572001
such as carpal tunnel syndrome.|246611002

The repetition|27582007
of coughing|272039006
produces
inflammation|257552002
which
produces
discomfort,|367391008|87128005
which in turn|282987006
produces
more coughing|242762006|272039006
creating
a closed loop._[citation|261000004

cough|272039006
typically
does
not
respond
to conventional cough treatments.|255333006|272039006|276239002

Treatment|276239002|416118004
consists
of any anti-inflammatory medicine to|330901000|410942007
treat|395077000
the inflammation,|257552002
and
a cough suppressant to|372791003
reduce|260400001
frequency|260864003|272123002
of the cough|272039006
until inflammation clears._[citation|257552002|84989007|257552002|263707001

may
increase|260366006
sensitivity|35209006|365705006
to other existing issues|74964007|55607006
such as allergies,|421961002
and
treatment|276239002|416118004
of other causes|74964007|134198009
of coughs|272039006|289114008
(
such as use|277889008|419385000

or
allergy medicines|408439002|410942007|421961002|410942007
)
may
help
speed recovery.

A bronchodilator,|372580007
which
helps
open|56116003
up the airways,|43725001|89187006
may
also
help
treat|395077000
this type|261664005
of cough._[citation|272039006

When
coughing|272039006
is
the only complaint|50607009|409586006|420295001|409586006
of a person|125676002
who
meets|229057006
the criteria
for asthma|195967001
(bronchial hyperresponsiveness
and
reversibility|263508009
)
,
this
is
termed cough-variant asthma.|409663006

Two related conditions|420797005|272151006|260905004|420797005|262094002|260905004
are
atopic cough|115665000|272039006

Atopic cough|115665000|272039006
occurs|272120004
in individuals|125676002|385435006
with a family history|57177007
of atopy,|115665000
abundant eosinophils|14793004|365601007
in the sputum,|45710003

is
also
characterized
by eosinophils|14793004|365601007
in the sputum,|45710003
without airway hyperresponsiveness|43725001|89187006
or
an atopic background.|115665000

This condition|260905004
responds
to treatment|276239002|416118004
with corticosteroids.|79440004

Cough|272039006
can
also
worsen|230993007|390772001
in an acute exacerbation|272118002
of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.|413846005

Asthma|195967001
is
a common cause|72906007|134198009
of chronic cough|68154008
in adults|133936004
and
children.|410601007|160499008

Coughing|272039006
may
be
the only symptom|50607009|420295001
the person|125676002
has
from their asthma,|195967001
or
asthma symptoms|195967001
may
also
include|55919000
wheezing,|56018004
shortness|359530003|367450005
of breath,|11891009

in their chest.|261179002

Depending
on
how severe|24484000
the asthma|195967001
is
it
can
be
treated|28995006
with bronchodilators|372580007
(medicine|410942007
which
causes|134198009
the airways to|43725001|89187006

or
inhaled steroids.|14910006|116566001

Treatment|276239002|416118004
of the asthma|195967001
should
make
the cough|272039006
go
away.

Chronic bronchitis|63480004
is
defined clinically
as a persistent cough|284523002
that
produces
sputum|45710003
(phlegm|52024008
)
and
mucus,|49909006
for
at least three months|276139006|421291004|258706009|263796003|421291004|258706009
in two consecutive years.|420797005|258707000

Chronic bronchitis|63480004
is
often|70232002
the cause|134198009
of ?smoker?s cough.?|46802002
The tobacco|39953003|12572000|57264008
causes|134198009
inflammation,|257552002
secretion|46242002
of mucus|49909006
into the airway,|43725001|89187006
and
difficulty|371157007
clearing|84989007|263707001
that mucus|49909006
out of the airways.|43725001|89187006

Coughing|272039006
helps
clear|263707001
those secretions out.|46242002

May
be
treated|28995006
by quitting smoking.|365981007

May
also
be
caused|23981006|134198009
by Pneumoconiosis|40122008
and
long-term fume inhalation.|278423000|14910006|278423000|278423000|422237004

In people|125676002
with unexplained cough,|315246003
gastroesophageal reflux disease|235595009
should
be
considered.

This
occurs|272120004
when
acidic contents|34957004|276824008

into the esophagus.|32849002|181245004

Symptoms usually
associated|47429007
with GERD|235595009
include|55919000
heartburn,|16331000
sour taste|76489005
in the mouth,|74262004|123851003|21082005|181220002
or
a feeling|285854004
of acid reflux|235595009
in the chest,|261179002
although
,
more
than half
of the people|125676002
with cough|272039006
from GERD|235595009
don?t
have
any other symptoms.|74964007

can
confirm|59156000
the diagnosis|439401001
of GERD.|235595009

Sometimes GERD|235595009
can
complicate|255302009
respiratory ailments|258162000|39104002|449071006|39104002
related|272151006|262094002
to
cough|272039006
,
such as asthma|195967001
or
bronchitis.|32398004

The treatment|276239002|416118004
involves|248448006
anti-acid medications|34957004|410942007
and
lifestyle changes|60134006|243326001|60134006|263703002
with surgery|83578000
indicated|410535002
in cases|398241000|413769002
not manageable
with conservative measures.|246445000|367346004

Coughing|272039006
may
be
caused|23981006|134198009
by air pollution|102413006
including|55919000
tobacco smoke,|102407002
particulate matter,|278694008
irritant gases,|412453003|74947009|263789000|74947009
and
dampness|17461003
in the home.|261770009

The human health effects|278412004|263775005|253861007
of poor air quality|11403006|417696007|263496004|255351007|417696007|263496004
are
far reaching,|46053002|282679008
but
principally
affect|4065008
the body's respiratory system|279495008|20139000|279495008|278197002|123037004|20139000|123037004|278197002
and
the cardiovascular system.|113257007|278198007

Individual reactions|125676002|263851003|385435006|263851003
to air pollutants|417696007
depend
on the type|261664005
of pollutant
a person|125676002
is
exposed|24932003
to,
the degree|258395000|246173007
of exposure,|71677004|24932003
the individual's health status|125676002|406221003|385435006|406221003
and
genetics.

People|125676002
who
exercise|61686008
outdoors,
for example,
on hot, smoggy days|264018002|258703001
increase|260366006
their exposure|71677004|24932003
to pollutants
in the air.|417696007

A foreign body|125670008
can
sometimes
be
suspected|415684004
,
for example
if
the cough|272039006
started|385652002
suddenly
when
the patient|116154003
was
eating.|48263008

Rarely,|103356009
sutures|408099007|360765007
left|7771000
behind
inside the airway branches|43725001|127484005|89187006|127484005
can
cause|23981006|134198009
coughing.|272039006

A cough|272039006
can
be
triggered|410658008
by dryness|13880007
from mouth breathing|77329001
or
recurrent aspiration|255227004|14910006|255227004|278847003|255227004|129316008|255227004|68052005
of food|255620007
into the windpipe|44567001
in people|125676002
with swallowing difficulties.|40739000

Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors|372733002
are
drugs|410942007
used|394850002
in diabetics,
heart disease,|56265001
and
high blood pressure.|38341003

In 10-25%_[citation
needed|410525008|103325001
_]
of the people|125676002
who
take|419652001
it,
it
can
cause|23981006|134198009
them to
have
a cough|272039006
as a side effect.

Cessation
of ACE Inhibitor use|372733002|277889008|372733002|419385000
is
the only way to|50607009|420295001
stop|422117008
the cough.|272039006

Such medicines|410942007
for hypertension|38341003
are
very common in use|260358002|72906007|277889008|260358002|72906007|419385000
such as ramipril|386872004
and
quinapril.|386874003

There
are
cases|398241000|413769002
of "cough|272039006
of unknown origin"|54690008
who
had
resolution
with stopping|260890000|385654001|422117008
the drug.[7]|410942007

A psychogenic cough|191954008
("habit cough"|90275003|272039006
or
"tic cough"|386783003|272039006|402732001|272039006
)
may
be
the cause|134198009
in the absence|2667000|418560003
of a physical problem.|5880005|55607006|19388002|55607006

In these instances
emotional|285854004|408453002
and
psychological problems
are
suspected.|415684004

However,
other illnesses|74964007|39104002
have
to
be
ruled|10828004
out
before a firm diagnosis|20583004|439401001|20583004
of psychogenic cough|191954008
is
made.

Psychogenic cough|191954008
is
thought to|88952004
be
more common|242762006|72906007
in children|410601007|160499008
than
in adults.|133936004

A possible scenario|371930009|60022001
:
psychogenic cough|191954008
develops
in a child|410601007|160499008
who
has
a chronically ill brother|367391008|70924004
or
sister.[8]|27733009

Cough|272039006
may
also
be
caused|23981006|134198009
by conditions|260905004
affecting|247591002|248448006
the lung tissue|113255004
such as bronchiectasis,|12295008
cystic fibrosis,|190905008
interstitial lung diseases|233703007
and
sarcoidosis.|31541009

Coughing|272039006
can
also
be
triggered|410658008
by benign|30807003
or
malignant lung tumors|363358000
or
mediastinal masses.|94147001

Through irritation|257553007
of the nerve,|3057000|256864008
diseases|64572001
of the external auditory canal|84301002|181178004
(wax,|69637009|41508009
for example
)
can
also
cause|23981006|134198009
cough.|272039006

Cardiovascular diseases|49601007
associated|47429007
with cough|272039006
are
heart failure,|84114007|42343007
pulmonary infarction|64662007
and
aortic aneurysm.|67362008

Nocturnal cough|62548007
is
associated|47429007
with heart failure,|84114007|42343007
as
the heart|80891009|302509004
does
not
compensate|17275008
for the increased volume shift|35105006|118565006|9546005|35105006|419569009|9546005|260366006|118565006|9546005|260366006|419569009|9546005
to the pulmonary circulation,|39607008|413854007|264164005|413854007
in turn|282987006
causing|23981006
pulmonary edema|19242006
and
resultant cough.|272039006

Other causes|74964007|134198009
of nocturnal cough|62548007
include|55919000
asthma,|195967001
post-nasal drip|75803007
and
gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD).|235595009

Another cause|134198009
of cough|272039006
occurring|272120004
preferentially
in supine position|40199007
is
recurrent aspiration.[9]|255227004|14910006|255227004|278847003|255227004|129316008|255227004|68052005

Coughing|272039006
may
also
be
used|394850002
for social reasons,|410666004
such as the coughing|272039006
before
giving|419582001
a speech.

Cough|272039006
may
also
be
psychogenic,|278926001
which
is
different|263735002
from habit coughing|90275003|272039006
and
tic coughing.|386783003|272039006|402732001|272039006

Coughing|272039006
may
occur|272120004
in tic disorders|386783003
such as Tourette syndrome,|5158005
although
it
should
be
distinguished
from throat-clearing|12239004
in this disorder.|64572001

Given|419582001
its irritant nature|412453003|277302009|263789000|277302009
to mammal tissues,|387976007|85756007
capsaicin|95995002
is
widely
used|394850002
to
determine
the cough threshold|272039006|118589004
and
as a tussive stimulant|272039006|372620004|272039006|373333006|289114008|372620004|289114008|373333006
in clinical research|58147004
of cough suppressants.|372791003

Capsaicin|95995002
is
what
makes
chilli peppers spicy,|24543001|24515005
and
might
explain
why workers|106541005
in factories|257605002
with these vegetables|22836000
can
develop
a cough.|272039006

Coughing|272039006
is
not always involuntary,
and
can
be
used|394850002
in social situations.

Coughing|272039006
can
be
used|394850002
to
attract
attention,|6769007
release|58000006|68776005|258760001|129299003|115956009
internal psychological tension,|260521003|60224009|53489000
or
become
a maladaptive displacement behavior.|284499009|286668001|284499009|263739008|284499009|276626008|43874005

It
is
believed
that
the frequency|260864003|272123002
of such coughing increases|272039006|260366006
in environments|276339004
vulnerable
to psychological tension|60224009|53489000
and
social conflict.|15863006

In such environments,|276339004
coughing|272039006
may
become
one|421379005
of many displacement behaviors|43874005
and/or
defense mechanisms.|224992003

Coughs|272039006|289114008
can
be
a symptom
to the common cold.|82272006|54150009

A cough|272039006
is
a protective reflex|87572000|106146005
in healthy individuals|263775005|125676002|263775005|385435006
which
is
influenced
by psychological factors.|60224009

The cough reflex|34606001
is
initiated
by stimulation|122545008
of two different classes|420797005|263735002|258391009
of afferent nerves,|49530007|3057000
namely
the myelinated rapidly adapting receptors,|23879005|418694008|116647005
and
nonmyelinated C-fibers|400293002|37202001
with endings|261782000|422117008
in the lungs.|39607008

However
it
is
not certain|17162000|255544004
that
the stimulation|122545008
of nonmyelinated C-fibers|400293002|37202001
leads|88488004|236874000
to
cough|272039006
with a reflex|87572000|106146005
as
it's meant|255586005
in physiology|1360005
(
with its own five components|421820001|246093002
)
:
this stimulation|122545008
may
cause|23981006|134198009
mast cells degranulation|6445007
(
through an asso-assonic reflex|87572000|106146005
)
and
edema|423666004
which
may
work|261041009
as a stimulus|8927009
for rapidly adapting receptors.|418694008|116647005

The determination
of the cause|134198009
of a cough usually|272039006
begins|255395001
by determining
if
it
is
specific|69658003
or
nonspecific|10003008
in nature.|277302009

A specific cough|69658003|272039006
is
one|421379005
associated|47429007
with other symptoms|74964007
and
further workup|46053002
is
dependent|371154000
on these symptoms
while
a non specific cough|10003008|272039006
occurs|272120004
without other signs|74964007|72670004
and
symptoms.

Further workup|46053002
may
include|55919000
labs,|118246004
x rays,|52250000|168537006
and
spirometry.[3]|127783003

The treatment|276239002|416118004
of a cough|272039006
in children|410601007|160499008
is
based|418836005
on the underlying cause|134198009
with the use|277889008|419385000
of cough medicine|372791003
supported|9096001|243114000
by little evidence|18669006
and
thus
not
recommended
by the American Academy of Pediatrics.[3]|394537008

A trial|110465008
of antibiotics|255631004
or
inhaled corticosteroids|14910006|79440004
may
be
tried
in children|410601007|160499008
with a chronic cough|68154008
in an attempt to
treat|395077000
protracted bacterial bronchitis|65878001
or
asthma respectively.[3]|195967001

Honey|227598003|421498008
can
be
considered
as a symptomatic relief treatment.|264931009|224978009|276239002|264931009|224978009|416118004

In a 2012[11],
A Double-blind,|1305003|1305003
Randomized
,
Placebo-Controlled Study,|31509003|110465008|31509003|224699009
parents significantly rated honey products|40683002|227598003|40683002|421498008
("treatment"|276239002|416118004
was
either
eucalyptus,|32354004|412596006
citrus,|78161008
and
labiatae|107624009
)
higher|75540009|371879000
than the silan date extract|410671006|62972009
(placebo
for symptomatic relief|264931009|224978009
of their children?s nocturnal cough|410601007|62548007|160499008|62548007
and
sleep difficulty|301345002
due to upper respiratory tract infections.|54150009

The measured outcomes|258104002|394617004
were
the nocturnal cough,|62548007
child sleep,|410601007|258158006|160499008|258158006
and
parental sleep.|40683002|258158006

Parents|40683002
were
instructed
to administer 10 g|418283001|258795003
of their child?s treatment product|410601007|276239002|410601007|416118004|160499008|276239002|160499008|416118004
within 30 minutes|259030007
of the child|410601007|160499008
going
to
sleep.|258158006

The parents|40683002
were
instructed
that
the preparation|225106003
could
be
given|419582001
undiluted
or
together with a noncaffeinated beverage.

The complications|116223007
of coughing|272039006
can
be
classified|73504009
as
either
acute|272118002
or
chronic.|90734009

Acute complications|272118002|116223007
include|55919000
cough syncope|90129003
(fainting spells|271594007
due to decreased blood flow|21762000
to the brain|12738006|258335003
when
coughs|272039006|289114008
are
prolonged|255224006
and
forceful|285653008
)
,
insomnia,|193462001
cough-induced vomiting,|272039006|16404004|249497008
rupture|415747007
of blebs|408764000
causing|23981006
spontaneous pneumothorax|80423007
(
although
this still
remains
to
be
proven|277025001
)
,
subconjunctival hemorrhage|78768009
or
"red eye",|75705005
coughing|272039006
defecation|111989001
and
in women|224526002
with a prolapsed uterus,|24976005
cough urination.|272039006|28278009

Chronic complications|90734009|116223007
are
common|72906007
and
include|55919000
abdominal|277112006
or
pelvic hernias,|277113001|414403008
fatigue fractures|240197007
of lower ribs|261122009|113197003
and
costochondritis.|64109004

A cough|272039006
is
the most common reason|4757001|72906007|410666004
for visiting
a primary care physician|446050000
in the United States.[3]|223688001
