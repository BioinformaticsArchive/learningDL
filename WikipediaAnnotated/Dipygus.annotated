Myrtle Corbin
was
a dipygus|71464000
;
she
married|160787000|87915002
and
had
5 children|264706000|410601007|264706000|160499008|264605009|410601007|264605009|160499008
and

In human cases|278412004|398241000|278412004|413769002
the inner two|260521003|420797005

develop
much smaller|242762006|263796003|242762006|255507004|4757001|263796003|4757001|255507004

a type|261664005
of "teras catadidymum"
("monster|54900001

).

Another sort
of deformity|276654001|127560004|417893002
with extra legs|30021000
can
happen
from a degenerated conjoined twin,|33359002|41337007
