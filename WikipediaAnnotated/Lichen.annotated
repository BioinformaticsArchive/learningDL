*Lichens|82113000

(!
play|300776002
/?la?k?n/,[1] sometimes /?l?t??n/[2]
are
composite organisms|1520008|410653004
consisting
of a fungus|414561005
(
the
*
*mycobiont
*
*
)
and
a photosynthetic partner|21356008|262043009
(
the
*
*photobiont
*
*
or
*
*phycobiont
*
*
)
growing
together
in a symbiotic relationship.|49105004|272151006

The photobiont
is
usually
either
a green alga|371246006|15122003
(commonly _Trebouxia_
)
or
cyanobacterium|415101005
(commonly _Nostoc_
).

The morphology,|116676008|72724002
physiology|1360005
and
biochemistry
of lichens|82113000
are
very different|260358002|263735002
from those
of the isolated fungus|46651001|414561005
and
alga|15122003
in culture.|252398009|61594008

Lichens|82113000
occur|272120004
in some
of the most extreme environments|4757001|12565001|276339004
on Earth?arctic tundra,
hot deserts,|264018002|284565008
rocky coasts,
and
toxic slag heaps.

However,
they
are
also abundant
as epiphytes
on leaves|90737002
and
branches|77796000|127484005
in rain forests|257616009
and
temperate woodland,
on bare rock,
including|55919000
walls|224727009
and
gravestones,
and
on exposed soil surfaces|24932003|415555003|410678000
(
e.g.
,
_Collema_
)
in otherwise mesic habitats.

Lichens|82113000
are
widespread|85333001
and
may
be
long-lived|255511005|224130005|255511005|419749002
;[4] however,|260308009
many
are
also vulnerable
to environmental disturbance,|276339004
and
may
be
useful
to scientists|308027003
in assessing
the effects|253861007
of air pollution,|102413006
[5][6][7] ozone depletion,|40057008|69251000
and
metal contamination.|425620007

Lichens|82113000
have
also
been
used|394850002
in making dyes|61789006
and
perfumes,|418785009
as well as
in traditional medicines.|263901007|410942007

The body|279495008|123037004
(thallus
of most lichens|82113000
is
different|263735002
from those
of
either
the fungus|414561005
or
alga|15122003
growing
separately.

The fungus|414561005
surrounds|355648006
the algal cells,|15122003|4421005
often|70232002
enclosing|68947003
them
within complex fungal tissues unique to|103360007|414561005|85756007
lichen|88996004|82113000
associations.|263534001

In many species|69658003
the fungus|414561005
penetrates|53568006
the algal cell wall,|15122003|4421005|224727009|15122003|362837007|224727009
forming|35810008
penetration pegs|53568006
or
haustoria
similar
to those
produced
by pathogenic fungi.|264418008|414561005

Lichens|82113000
are
poikilohydric,
capable
of surviving extremely low levels|62482003|258395000|371880002|258395000
of water content.|11713004|276824008|119318008|276824008

However,
the re-configuration|228877007|103377007
of membranes|83097008
following|255260001
a period|259037005
of dehydration|34095006
requires
several minutes|261028005|258701004|261028005|255507004|261028005|356624006
at least.|276139006|263796003

The algal|15122003
or
cyanobacterial cells|415101005|4421005
are
photosynthetic,|21356008
and
as
in plants|31006001
they
reduce|260400001
atmospheric carbon dioxide|421982008
into organic carbon sugars to|87453002|74801000
feed|129007004
both
symbionts.|284686001

Both
partners|262043009
gain|35105006|255396000|260366006|260369004|398092000
water|11713004|119318008
and
mineral nutrients mainly|87918000|226355009
from the atmosphere,|304607008
through rain
and
dust.|33008008

The fungal partner|414561005|262043009
protects
the alga|15122003
by retaining water,|397909002|11713004|397909002|119318008
serving
as a larger capture area|255509001|42798000|263768009|42798000
for mineral nutrients|87918000|226355009
and
,
in some cases,|398241000|413769002
provides
minerals|87918000
obtained|398092000
from the substrate.

If
a cyanobacterium|415101005
is
present,|52101004|246105001
as
a primary partner|63161005|262043009|261424001|262043009
or
another
symbiont|284686001
in addition|260364009
to green alga|371246006|15122003
as
in certain tripartite lichens,|17162000|82113000
they
can
fix|102491009
atmospheric nitrogen,|36012007
complementing|20823009
the activities|257733005
of the green alga.|371246006|15122003

Although
strains|48532005|276768000
of cyanobacteria|415101005
found|404684003
in various cyanolichens|256220008
are
often closely|70232002
related|272151006|262094002
to
one|421379005
another,
they
differ
from the most closely|4757001
related|272151006|262094002
free-living strains.|37837009|224130005|48532005|37837009|224130005|276768000|37837009|419749002|48532005|37837009|419749002|276768000

The lichen association|88996004|263534001|88996004|272151006|82113000|263534001|82113000|272151006
is
a close symbiosis.|29179001|49105004

It
extends|255590007
the ecological range
of
both
partners|262043009
but
is
not always obligatory
for their growth
and
reproduction|263767004
in natural environments,|224803003
since
many
of the algal symbionts|15122003|284686001
can
live|419749002
independently.

A prominent example|4657009
is
the alga Trentepohlia|15122003
which
forms|246176004
orange-coloured populations|256306003|103366001|385436007|229776000|103366001|385436007|371242008|103366001|385436007
on tree trunks|22097005|22943007|22097005|262225004
and
suitable rock faces.|89545001

Lichen propagules|88996004|82113000
(diaspores
)
typically
contain|42504009
cells|4421005
from
both
partners,|262043009
although
the fungal components|414561005|246093002
of so-called "fringe species"|223528007|69658003
rely
instead
on algal cells|15122003|4421005
dispersed|86902002
by the ?core species.?_[citation|260235002|69658003

_]

Lichen associations|88996004|263534001|82113000|263534001
may
be
examples
of mutualism,
commensalism|49105004
or
even parasitism,
depending
on the species.|69658003

Cyanobacteria in laboratory settings|415101005|261904005
can
grow
faster|16985007|277748003
when
they
are
alone|105529008
rather than
when
they
are
part|260726005
of a lichen.|88996004|82113000

Recently,|6493001
on 26 April 2012,
scientists|308027003
reported|229059009|223458004
that lichen|88996004|82113000
survived
and
showed
remarkable results|394617004
on the adaptation capacity|60783002|4452006
of photosynthetic activity|21356008|48761009|21356008|55561003|21356008|258745004|21356008|257733005

in the Mars Simulation Laboratory (MSL)|261904005

Although
lichens|82113000
had
been
recognized
as organisms|410653004
for quite
some time,|410669006
it
was
not
until 1867,
when
Swiss botanist Simon Schwendener|76574004|5334003|262144001
proposed
his dual theory
of lichens,|82113000
that
the true nature|31874001|277302009
of the lichen association|88996004|263534001|88996004|272151006|82113000|263534001|82113000|272151006
began|255395001
to
emerge.

Schwendener's hypothesis,
which
at the time|410669006
lacked|41277001
experimental evidence,|18669006
arose|68727004
from his extensive analysis|41118005|272389005
of the anatomy|91723000
and
development|278923009
in lichens,|82113000
algae,|15122003
and
fungi|414561005
using|260676000
a light microscope.|56242006|65473004|371268001|65473004

Many
of the leading lichenologists|236874000
at the time,|410669006
such as James Crombie
and
Nylander,
rejected Schwendener's hypothesis
because
the common consensus|72906007
was
that
all living organisms|410653004
were
autonomous.|72167002

Other prominent biologists,|74964007|4657009|72327007
such as Heinrich Anton
de Bary,
Albert Bernhard Frank,
Melchior Treub
and
Hermann Hellriegel
were
not so quick to|255358001
reject
Schwendener's ideas|363878000
and
the concept soon
spread|410677005
into other areas|74964007|42798000
of study,|110465008|224699009
such as microbial, plant,|31006001
animal|387961004
and
human pathogens.|278412004|264418008

When
the complex relationships|103360007|272151006
between pathogenic microorganisms|264418008|264395009
and
their hosts
were
finally
identified?|7882003
refuting
the idea|363878000
of holistic organisms?Schwendener's hypothesis|410653004
began|255395001
to
gain|35105006|255396000|260366006|260369004|398092000
popularity.

Further experimental proof|46053002|229796008
of the dual nature|277302009
of lichens|82113000
was
obtained|398092000
when
Eugen Thomas
published
his results|394617004
in 1939
on the first successful re-synthesis experiment.[13]|255216001|385669000|228877007|11798007|232714002|385669000|228877007|11798007

Living
as a symbiont|284686001
in a lichen|88996004|82113000
appears
to
be
a very successful way|260358002|385669000
for a fungus to|414561005
derive
essential nutrients,|34325006|226355009
as
about 20%
of all fungal species|414561005|69658003
have
acquired|255396000
this mode
of life.|224130005

The largest number|255509001|410680006|255509001|410681005|263768009|410680006|263768009|410681005
of lichenized fungi|414561005
occur|272120004
in the Ascomycota,|415098006
with about 40%|259031006
of species forming|69658003|35810008
such an association.|263534001|272151006

Some
of these lichenized fungi|414561005
occur|272120004
in orders
with nonlichenized fungi|414561005
that
live|419749002
as saprotrophs
or
plant parasites|31006001|37763007
(
for example,
the Leotiales,|426858001
Dothideales,|426602007
and
Pezizales.|425815005

Other lichen fungi|74964007|88996004|414561005|74964007|82113000|414561005
occur|272120004
in only five orders|50607009|421820001|420295001|421820001
in which
all members|394852005
are
engaged|54986009
in this habit|90275003
(Orders Graphidales,
Gyalectales,
Peltigerales,
Pertusariales,
and
Teloschistales.

Lichenized
and
nonlichenized fungi|414561005
can
even
be
found|404684003
in the same genus|262126009|18511007
or
species.|69658003

Overall,
about 98%
of lichens|82113000
have
an ascomycetous mycobiont .

Next to|18769003
the Ascomycota,|415098006
the largest number|255509001|410680006|255509001|410681005|263768009|410680006|263768009|410681005
of lichenized fungi|414561005
occur|272120004
in the unassigned fungi imperfecti.|106565008

Comparatively few Basidiomycetes|106559008|423518001
are
lichenized
,
but
these
include|55919000
agarics,
such as species|69658003
of _Lichenomphalia_,
clavarioid fungi,|414561005
such as species|69658003
of _Multiclavula_,
and
corticioid fungi,|414561005
such as species|69658003
of _Dictyonema_.

The autotrophic symbionts|284668004|284686001
occurring|272120004
in lichens|82113000
are
simple, photosynthetic organisms commonly|13673007|21356008|410653004
and
traditionally
known|36692007
as algae.|15122003

These symbionts|284686001
include|55919000
both
prokaryotic
and
eukaryotic organisms.|415671008|410653004

Approximately 100 species|26175008|69658003
of photosynthetic partners|21356008|262043009
from 40 genera|259031006|18511007
and
five distinct classes|421820001|258391009
(prokaryotic
:
Cyanophyceae|415101005|444809005
;
eukaryotic|415671008
:
Trebouxiophyceae,
Phaeophyceae,
Chlorophyceae
have
been
found|404684003
to
associate|47429007
with the lichen-forming fungi.|88996004|35810008|414561005|82113000|35810008|414561005

The prokaryotes|115166000
belong
to the Cyanobacteria,|415101005
whose
representatives
are
often|70232002
called bluegreen algae.|15122003

The bluegreen algae|15122003
occur|272120004
as symbionts|284686001
in about 8%
of the known lichens.|36692007|82113000

The most commonly|4757001
occurring|272120004
genus|18511007
is
_Nostoc_.

The majority
of the lichens|82113000
contain|42504009
eukaryotic autotrophs|415671008|284668004
belonging
to the Chlorophyta
(green algae|371246006|15122003
)
or
to the Xanthophyta
(yellow-green algae|371248007|15122003
).

About 90%|264705001|264703008
of all known lichens|36692007|82113000
have
a green algae|371246006|15122003
as a symbiont,|284686001
and
among these,
_Trebouxia_
is
the most common genus,|4757001|72906007|18511007
occurring|272120004
in about 40%|259031006
of all lichens.|82113000

The second most commonly|81170007|257997001|288495006
represented
green algae genus|371246006|15122003|18511007
is
_Trentepohlia_.

Overall,
about 100 species|69658003
are
known|36692007
to
occur|272120004
as autotrophs|284668004
in lichens.|82113000

All
the algae|15122003
are
probably able to|371150009
exist
independently
in nature|277302009
as well as
in the lichen.[17]|88996004|82113000

A particular fungus species|414561005|69658003
and
algal species|15122003|69658003
are
not necessarily always
associated|47429007
together
in a lichen.|88996004|82113000

One fungus,|421379005|414561005
for example,
can
form|246176004
lichens|82113000
with a variety
of different algae.|263735002|15122003

The thalli
produced
by a given fungal symbiont|414561005|284686001
with its differing partners|262043009
will
be
similar,
and
the secondary metabolites|2603003|81170007
identical,|20323000
indicating|410535002
that
the fungus|414561005
has
the dominant role
in determining
the morphology|116676008|72724002
of the lichen.|88996004|82113000

Further,|46053002
the same algal species|262126009|15122003|69658003
can
occur|272120004
in association|263534001|272151006
with different fungal partners.|263735002|414561005|262043009

Lichens|82113000
are
known|36692007
in which there
is
one fungus|421379005|414561005
associated|47429007
with two|420797005
or
even three algal species.|421291004|15122003|69658003

Rarely,|103356009
the reverse
can
occur|272120004
,
and
two|420797005
or
more fungal species|242762006|414561005|69658003
can
interact
to
form|246176004
the same lichen.[17]|262126009|88996004|262126009|82113000

Both
the lichen|88996004|82113000
and
the fungus partner|414561005|262043009
bear|106970005
the same scientific name,|262126009
and
the lichens|82113000
are
being
integrated
into the classification schemes|73504009
for fungi.|414561005

The alga|15122003
bears|106970005
its own scientific name,
which
bears|106970005
no relationship|272151006
to that
of the lichen|88996004|82113000
or
fungi.[15]|414561005

Some lichens|82113000
have
the aspect
of leaves|90737002
(foliose lichens|82113000
)
;
others|74964007
cover|255334000
the substrate
like a crust|69640009
(crustose lichens|82113000
)
(_illustration,
right_|24028007
)
,
others|74964007
such as the genus _Ramalina_|18511007
adopt|160496001
shrubby forms|246176004
(fruticose lichens|82113000
)
,
and
there
are
gelatinous lichens|373531009|82113000
such as the genus _Collema_.[18]|18511007

Although
the form|246176004
of a lichen|88996004|82113000
is
determined
by the genetic material|256926007
of the fungal partner,|414561005|262043009
association|263534001|272151006
with a photobiont
is
required
for the development|278923009
of
that form.|246176004

When
grown
in the laboratory|261904005
in the absence|2667000|418560003
of its photobiont,
a lichen fungus|88996004|414561005|82113000|414561005
develops
as an undifferentiated mass|263918006|300848003|263918006|118538004
of hyphae.|284688000

If
combined|89780004
with its photobiont
under appropriate conditions,|260905004
its characteristic form emerges,|246176004
in the process|415178003
called
morphogenesis|54125006
(Brodo,
Sharnoff & Sharnoff,
2001
).

In a few remarkable cases,|57176003|398241000|57176003|413769002
a single lichen fungus|125681006|88996004|414561005|125681006|82113000|414561005|50607009|88996004|414561005|50607009|82113000|414561005
can
develop
into two very different lichen forms|420797005|260358002|263735002|88996004|246176004|420797005|260358002|263735002|82113000|246176004
when
associating|47429007
with
either
a green algal|371246006|15122003
or
a cyanobacterial symbiont.|415101005|284686001

Quite naturally,
these alternative forms|246176004
were
at first|255216001|232714002
considered to
be
different species,|263735002|69658003
until
they
were
first|255216001|232714002
found|404684003
growing
in a conjoined manner.

There
is
evidence to|18669006
suggest
that
the lichen symbiosis|88996004|49105004|82113000|49105004
is
parasitic
or
commensalistic,|49105004
rather than
mutualistic
(Ahmadjian 1993
).

The photosynthetic partner|21356008|262043009
can
exist
in nature|277302009
independently of the fungal partner,|414561005|262043009
but
not vice versa.

Furthermore,
photobiont cells|4421005
are
routinely
destroyed
in the course|288524001
of nutrient exchange.|226355009

The association|263534001|272151006
is
able to|371150009
continue|255238004
because
reproduction|263767004
of the photobiont cells|4421005
matches|33336008
the rate
at which
they
are
destroyed.

Under magnification,
a section|62083003|118630004
through a typical foliose lichen thallus|88996004|82113000
reveals|263857004
four layers|421534005
of interlaced fungal filaments.|84489001

The uppermost layer
is
formed|35810008
by densely agglutinated fungal hyphae|255596001|284688000
building
a protective outer layer|261074009
called
the cortex,|40146001
which
can
reach|282679008
several hundred ?m|261028005
in thickness.|246703001

This cortex|40146001
may
be
further|46053002
topped|421812003
by an epicortex 0.6-1?m
thick|246703001
in some Parmeliaceae,
which
may
be
with
or
without pores,
and
is
secreted
by cells?|4421005
it
is
not
itself cellular.|4421005

In lichens|82113000
that
include|55919000
both
green algal|371246006|15122003
and
cyanobacterial symbionts,|415101005|284686001
the cyanobacteria|415101005
may
be
held|421139008
on the upper|261183002
or
lower surface|261122009|410678000
in small pustules|255507004|271760008
called
cephalodia.

Beneath the upper cortex|261183002|40146001
is
an algal layer|15122003
composed
of algal cells|15122003|4421005
embedded
in rather densely interwoven fungal hyphae.|255596001|284688000

Each cell|4421005|362837007
or
group|261586004|160481000|389109008
of cells|4421005
of the photobiont
is
usually individually
wrapped|262318008
by hyphae,|284688000
and
in some cases|398241000|413769002
penetrated|53568006
by an haustorium.

Beneath this algal layer|15122003
is
a third layer|70905002
of loosely interwoven fungal hyphae|284688000
without algal cells.|15122003|4421005

This layer
is
called
the medulla.|26519002|279104005

Beneath the medulla,|26519002|279104005
the bottom surface|421610009|410678000
resembles
the upper surface|261183002|410678000
and
is
called
the lower cortex,|261122009|40146001
again
consisting
of densely|255596001
packed|53999001
fungal hyphae.|284688000

The lower cortex often|261122009|40146001|70232002
bears|106970005
rootlike fungal structures|85077000|414561005|2338009|414561005
known|36692007
as rhizines,
which
serve
to
attach|102491009
the thallus
to the substrate
on which
it
grows.

Lichens also sometimes|82113000
contain|42504009
structures
made
from fungal metabolites,|414561005
for example crustose lichens sometimes|82113000
have
a polysaccharide layer|71544008
in the cortex.|40146001

Although
each lichen thallus generally|88996004|82113000
appears
homogeneous,
some evidence|18669006
seems
to
suggest
that
the fungal component|414561005|246093002
may
consist
of more|242762006
than one genetic individual|421379005|3950001|125676002|421379005|3950001|385435006|421379005|255395001|125676002|421379005|255395001|385435006
of that species.|69658003

This
seems
to also
be
true|31874001
of the photobiont species|69658003
involved.|248448006

Lichens|82113000
are
informally
classified|73504009
by growth form|246176004
into
:

Many lichens|260396001|82113000
reproduce
asexually,
either
by vegetative reproduction|263767004
or
through the dispersal
of diaspores
containing|42504009
algal|15122003
and
fungal cells.|414561005|4421005

_Soredia_
(singular soredium|50607009
are
small groups|255507004|261586004|255507004|160481000
of algal cells|15122003|4421005
surrounded|355648006
by fungal filaments|84489001
that
form|246176004
in structures
called
_soralia_,
from which
the soredia
can
be
dispersed|86902002
by wind.|308698004|90569008

Another form|246176004
of diaspore
are
_isidia_,
elongated outgrowths
from the thallus
that break
off
for mechanical dispersal.|261018001

Fruticose lichens|82113000
in particular
can
easily|36203004
fragment.|29140007

Because of the relative lack|125677006|41277001|29920004|41277001
of differentiation
in the thallus,
the line|50009006
between diaspore formation|11798007|255277001
and
vegetative reproduction|263767004
is
often|70232002
blurred.|246636008

Many lichens break up|260396001|82113000|255532002|260396001|82113000|353734004
into fragments|29140007
when
they
dry|13880007
,
dispersing|86902002
themselves
by wind action,|308698004|129264002|90569008|129264002
to
resume
growth
when
moisture returns.|17461003|7528007

Many lichen fungi|88996004|414561005|82113000|414561005
appear
to
reproduce
sexually|365952006
in a manner
typical
of fungi,|414561005
producing
spores|263883009
that
are
presumably
the result|394617004
of sexual fusion|365952006|31883006|365952006|122501008
and
meiosis.|53992005

Following|255260001
dispersal,
such fungal spores|46901008
must
meet|229057006
with a compatible algal partner|385433004|15122003|262043009|7883008|15122003|262043009
before a functional lichen|40143009|88996004|40143009|82113000|246464006|88996004|246464006|82113000
can
form.|246176004

This
may
be
a common form|72906007|246176004
of reproduction|263767004
in basidiolichens,
which
form|246176004
fruitbodies
resembling
their nonlichenized relatives.|125677006

Among the ascolichens,
spores|263883009
are
produced
in spore-producing bodies,|255811001|279495008|255811001|123037004|263883009|279495008|263883009|123037004
the three most common spore body types|421291004|72906007|255811001|279495008|261664005|421291004|72906007|255811001|123037004|261664005|421291004|72906007|263883009|279495008|261664005|421291004|72906007|263883009|123037004|261664005
are
the
*
*apothecia
*
*,
*
*perithecia
*
*
and
the
*
*pycnidia
*
*.[20]

For reproduction,|263767004
lichen|88996004|82113000
possess
isidia,
soredia,
and
undergo
simple fragmentation.|13673007|112624007

These structures
are
also
composed
of a fungal hyphae|284688000
wrapped|262318008
around cyanobacteria.|415101005

(Eichorn,
Evert,
and
Raven,
2005
)
While
the reproductive structures
are
all
composed
of the same components|262126009|246093002
(Mycobiont
and
Photobiont
)
they
are
each unique
in other ways.|74964007

Isidia
are
small outgrowths|255507004
on the exterior
of the lichen.|88996004|82113000

Soredia
are
powdery propagules|85581007
that
are
released|68776005|129299003
from the top|421812003
of the thallus.

In order to
establish|263748003
the lichen,|88996004|82113000
the soredia propagules
must
contain|42504009
both the photobiont
and
the mycobiont.[22]

Lichenometry
is
a technique|272394005
used|394850002
to
determine
the age|424144002
of exposed rock surfaces|24932003|410678000
based|418836005
on the size|277049003
of lichen thalli.|88996004|82113000

Introduced|127487003
by Beschel
in the 1950s,
[23]|264657009
the technique|272394005
has
found many applications.|404684003|410618006|410618006

Lichens|82113000
must
compete
with plants|31006001
for access|260507000
to sunlight,|49926000
but
because of their small size|255507004|277049003
and
slow growth,|419443000
they
thrive
in places|257557008
where higher plants|417177009
have
difficulty|371157007
growing.

Lichens|82113000
are
often|70232002
the first|255216001|232714002
to settle|128719006
in places|257557008
lacking|41277001
soil,|415555003
constituting
the sole vegetation|57999000|264340003
in some extreme environments|12565001|276339004
such as those
found|404684003
at high mountain elevations|75540009|257644005|255456001|371879000|257644005|255456001
and
at high latitudes._[citation|75540009|371879000
needed|410525008|103325001
_]
Some
survive
in the tough
conditions|78326006|260905004
of deserts,|284565008
and
others|74964007
on frozen soil|48103003|415555003|261014004|415555003
of the Arctic regions.[24]|410673009

A major ecophysiological advantage|255603008
of lichens|82113000
is
that
they
are
poikilohydric
(_poikilo_- variable,|255372005
_hydric_-|2141009
relating|272151006|262094002
to water|11713004|119318008
)
,
meaning|255586005
that
though
they
have
little control|281411007|31509003|255507004|31509003
over the status|263490005
of their hydration,|405006006
they
can
tolerate
irregular|49608001
and
extended periods|255536004|259037005|288467006|259037005|255590007|259037005
of severe desiccation.|24484000|257791009

Like some mosses,|421648004
liverworts,|421813008
ferns,|35803002
and
a few "resurrection plants",|57176003|31006001
upon desiccation,|257791009
lichens|82113000
enter|417985001
a metabolic suspension|7946007|37595005|385655000
or
stasis|19685008
(
known|36692007
as cryptobiosis
in which
the cells|4421005
of the lichen symbionts|88996004|284686001|82113000|284686001
are
dehydrated|34095006
to a degree|258395000|246173007
that halts most biochemical activity.|80534008|48761009|80534008|55561003|80534008|258745004|80534008|257733005

In this cryptobiotic state,|398070004
lichens|82113000
can
survive
wider extremes|90522003|12565001
of temperature,|105723007|246508008
radiation|30821001|82107009|108290001
and
drought
in the harsh environments|76412005|276339004
they often inhabit.|70232002

Lichens|82113000
do
not
have
roots|2338009
and
do
not
need|410525008|103325001
to
tap|86088003
continuous reservoirs|255238004|257687008
of water|11713004|119318008
like most higher plants,|417177009
thus
they
can
grow
in locations|246267002
impossible
for most plants,|31006001
such as bare rock,
sterile soil|261029002|415555003|15296000|415555003
or
sand,|128489003
and
various artificial structures|256220008|41525006
such as walls,|224727009
roofs|224738009
and
monuments.

Many lichens also|260396001|82113000
grow
as epiphytes
(_epi_-
on the surface,|410678000
_phyte_- plant|31006001
)
on plants,|31006001
particularly
on the trunks|22943007|262225004
and
branches|77796000|127484005
of trees.|22097005

When
growing
on plants,|31006001
lichens|82113000
are
not parasites|37763007
;
they
do
not
consume
any part|260726005
of the plant|31006001
nor
poison|35331000
it.

Some ground-dwelling lichens,|261770009|82113000
such as members|394852005
of the subgenus _Cladina_
(reindeer lichens|71087001|82113000
)
,
however,
produce
allelopathic chemicals|441900009
which
leach
into the soil|415555003
and
inhibit|61511001
the germination
of plant seeds|264337003
and
growth
of young plants.|84422007|31006001

Stability|58158008
(
that
is
,
longevity|111951006
)
of their substrate
is
a major factor|255603008
of lichen habitats.|88996004|82113000

Most lichens|82113000
grow
on stable rock surfaces|58158008|410678000
or
the bark|79470009
of old trees,|70753007|22097005
but
many others|260396001
grow
on soil|415555003
and
sand.|128489003

In these latter cases,|398241000|413769002
lichens|82113000
are
often|70232002
an important part|260726005
of soil stabilization|415555003|115979005
;
indeed,
in some desert ecosystems,|284565008
vascular|59820001
(higher|75540009|371879000
)
plant|31006001
seeds|264337003
cannot
become
established|263748003|385645004
except
in places|257557008
where
lichen|88996004|82113000
crusts|69640009
stabilize|409051000
the sand|128489003
and
help
retain|397909002
water.|11713004|119318008

The European Space Agency|414152003|224877003|224877003
has
discovered
that lichens|82113000
can
survive
unprotected
in space.

In an experiment
led|88488004|236874000
by Leopoldo Sancho
from the Complutense University|224871002
of Madrid,
two species|420797005|69658003
of lichen?_Rhizocarpon geographicum_|88996004|82113000
and
_Xanthoria elegans_?
were
sealed|19314006|106980009|278420002
in a capsule|385049006|428641000
and
launched
on a Russian Soyuz rocket|297514005|85163001
on 31 May 2005.|264664006

Once
in
orbit|363654007|181143004
the capsules|385049006|428641000
were
opened|56116003
and
the lichens|82113000
were
directly
exposed|24932003
to the vacuum|81547007
of space
with its widely fluctuating temperatures|255341006|246508008
and
cosmic radiation.|46316000

After 15 days|258703001
the lichens|82113000
were
brought|68369002
back
to earth
and
were
found|404684003
to
be
in full health|261015003|263775005
with no discernible damage|7882003|37782003
from their time|410669006
in orbit.[25][26]|363654007|181143004

When
growing
on mineral surfaces,|87918000|410678000
some lichens slowly|82113000|419443000
decompose
their substrate
by chemically degrading|441900009
and
physically
disrupting
the minerals,|87918000
contributing
to the process|415178003
of weathering
by which
rocks|30189004
are
gradually
turned|282987006
into soil.|415555003

While
this contribution
to weathering
is
usually benign,|30807003
it
can
cause|23981006|134198009
problems|55607006
for artificial stone structures.|41525006|384600008

For example,
there
is
an ongoing lichen growth problem|255238004|88996004|55607006|255238004|82113000|55607006
on Mount Rushmore National Memorial|246143003
that
requires
the employment
of mountain-climbing conservators to|111055000
clean|228402009
the monument.

Lichens|82113000
may
be
eaten|48263008
by some animals,|387961004
such as reindeer,|71087001
living|224130005|419749002
in arctic regions.|410673009

The larvae
of a number|410680006|410681005
of Lepidoptera species|125069006
feed|129007004
exclusively
on lichens.|82113000

These
include|55919000
Common Footman|72906007
and
Marbled Beauty.|106148006|271712005|272144002

However,
lichens|82113000
are
very low|260362008
in protein|88878007
and
high|75540009|371879000
in carbohydrates,|2331003
making
them
unsuitable
for some animals.|387961004

Lichens|82113000
are
also
used|394850002
by the Northern Flying Squirrel|392599007
for nesting,
food,|255620007
and
a water source|11713004|260753009|119318008|260753009
during winter.

If lichens|82113000
are
exposed|24932003
to air pollutants|417696007
at all times,|410669006|417929005
without any deciduous parts,|260726005
they
are
unable to|371151008
avoid
the accumulation
of pollutants.

Also
lacking|41277001
stomata|245857005
and
a cuticle,
lichens|82113000
may
absorb
aerosols|64242006|52262001
and
gases|74947009
over the entire thallus surface|255503000|410678000|260232004|410678000
from which
they
may
readily
diffuse|19648000
to the photobiont layer.

Because
lichens|82113000
do
not
possess
roots,|2338009
their primary source|63161005|260753009|261424001|260753009
of most elements|57795002
is
the air,|417696007
and
therefore elemental levels|57795002|258395000
in lichens often|82113000|70232002
reflect|225436004
the accumulated composition
of ambient air.|417696007

The processes|415178003
by which atmospheric deposition|46595003
occurs|272120004
include|55919000
fog|256236005
and
dew,
gaseous absorption,|308698004|74947009
and
dry deposition.|13880007|46595003

Consequently,
many environmental studies|276339004|110465008|276339004|224699009
with lichens|82113000
emphasize
their feasibility
as effective biomonitors|255403003|254648000
of atmospheric quality.[27][29]|263496004

Not
all lichens|82113000
are
equally sensitive|83185005
to air pollutants,|417696007
so
different lichen species|263735002|88996004|69658003|263735002|82113000|69658003
show
different levels|263735002|258395000
of sensitivity|35209006|365705006
to specific atmospheric pollutants.|69658003

The sensitivity|35209006|365705006
of a lichen|88996004|82113000
to air pollution|102413006
is
directly
related|272151006|262094002
to the energy|248272003
needs|410525008|103325001
of the mycobiont,
so
that
the stronger|260404005
the dependency|371154000
of the mycobiont
on the photobiont,
the more sensitive|242762006|83185005
the lichen|88996004|82113000
is
to air pollution.|102413006

Upon exposure|71677004|24932003
to air pollution,|102413006
the photobiont
may
use|277889008|419385000
metabolic energy|248272003
for repair|298005009|4365001
of cellular structures|4421005
that
would
otherwise
be
used|394850002
for maintenance
of photosynthetic activity,|21356008|48761009|21356008|55561003|21356008|258745004|21356008|257733005
therefore
leaving|7771000|90737002
less metabolic energy|276139006|248272003|263796003|248272003
available|103328004
for the mycobiont.

The alteration
of the balance|249982003|78933003|282295000
between the photobiont
and
mycobiont
can
lead|88488004
to the breakdown|40091007|125366008
of the symbiotic association.|49105004|263534001|49105004|272151006

Therefore,
lichen decline|88996004|82113000
may
result|394617004
not only
from the accumulation
of toxic substances,|35331000
but
also
from altered nutrient|226355009
supplies|425398004
that favor one symbiont|421379005|284686001
over the other.[27]|74964007

The evolution
of lichens|82113000
and
the phylum Ascomycota|415098006
is
complex|103360007
and
not well understood,|20572008|66216009
but
because there
are
fifteen different classes|263735002|258391009
of Ascomycetes,|415098006|426192000
scientists generally|308027003
believe
that different lichens|263735002|82113000
have
evolved|59381007
independently
from one|421379005
another
through analogous evolution.

Lichenized fungi|414561005
have
continued|255238004
to
evolve|59381007
,
developing
differently
than those
that
do
not
form|246176004
lichens._[citation|82113000

Lichenization
is
an ancient nutritional strategy
for fungi.|414561005

The extreme habitats|12565001
that lichens inhabit|82113000
are
not ordinarily
conducive
to producing fossils.

The oldest fossil lichens|70753007|82113000
in which
both
symbiotic partners|49105004|262043009
have
been
recovered|74822006
date|410671006
to the Early Devonian Rhynie chert,|264499004
about 400 million years old.|258707000|70753007

The slightly older fossil _Spongiophyton_|425404009|70753007
has
also
been
interpreted|363714003
as a lichen|88996004|82113000
on morphological[34]|116676008|72724002
and
isotopic[35] grounds,|33638001
although
the isotopic basis|33638001|33638001|418836005
is
decidedly shaky.|26079004

It
has
been
suggested?
although
not yet
proven?|277025001
that
the even older fossil _Nematothallus_|70753007
was
a lichen.[37]|88996004|82113000

It
has
also
been
claimed
that Ediacaran fossils
were
lichens|82113000
;[38]|264670000
although
this claim initially|884001
met|229057006
with scepticism_[citation
needed|410525008|103325001
_]
for all Ediacaran fossils,
additional evidence|260364009|18669006
has
been
marshalled
for a lichen interpretation|88996004|280452008|82113000|280452008
of _Dickinsonia_.

Lichen-|88996004|82113000
like fossils
consist
of coccoid cells|4421005
and
thin filaments,|18043004
preserved|277405005
in marine phosphorite
of the Doushantuo Formation|11798007|255277001
in southern China.|223581004

These fossils
are
thought|88952004
to
be
551
to 635 million years old|258707000|70753007
(belonging
to the Neoproterozoic era
).

Discovery
of these fossils
suggest
that fungi|414561005
developed
symbiotic partnerships|49105004
with photoautotrophs|284728008
long|255511005
before the evolution
of vascular plants.|421197007

_Winfrenatia_,
an early zygomycetous lichen symbiosis|264499004|88996004|49105004|264499004|82113000|49105004
that
may
have
involved|248448006
controlled|31509003
parasitism,
is
an impression|286781002
found|404684003
in Scotland,|223678002
belonging
to the early Devonian times.|264499004|410669006|264499004|417929005

There
are
also several examples
of fossilized lichens|82113000
embedded
in amber.

The fossilized _Anzia_
is
found|404684003
in pieces
of amber
in northern Europe|223502009
and
dates|410671006
back approximately 40 million years.|26175008|259031006|258707000

Fossilized
_Lobaria_
comes
from Trinity County
in northern California,|224043007|25997004
USA|223688001
and
dates|410671006
back
to the early|264499004
to middle Miocene.[42]|255562008|399488007

In 1995,
Gargas
and
colleagues
proposed
that there
were
at least five independent origins|276139006|421820001|371153006|255395001|263796003|421820001|371153006|255395001
of lichenization
;
three|421291004
in the basidiomycetes|106559008|423518001
and
at least
two|420797005
in the Ascomycetes.|415098006|426192000

However,
Lutzoni
et
al.

(2000
)
indicate|410535002
that lichenization probably
evolved|59381007
earlier|264499004
and
was
followed|367409002
by multiple independent losses.|260396001|371153006

Some non-lichen-forming fungi|88996004|35810008|414561005|82113000|35810008|414561005
may
have
secondarily
lost
the ability to|371150009
form|246176004
a lichen association.|88996004|263534001|88996004|272151006|82113000|263534001|82113000|272151006

As a result,|394617004
lichenization
has
been
viewed|246516004
as a highly successful nutritional strategy.[44][45]|75540009|385669000

Lichens|82113000
were
a component|246093002
of the early terrestrial ecosystems,|264499004
and
the estimated age|414135002|424144002
of the oldest terrestrial lichen fossil|70753007|88996004|70753007|82113000
is
400 Ma.

Recent|6493001
(2009
)
studies|110465008|224699009
suggest
that
the ancestral ecological state|398070004
of the Ascomycota|415098006
was
saprobism,
and
that independent lichenization events|371153006|272379006
have
occurred|272120004
multiple times.[48]|260396001|410669006|260396001|417929005

Lichens|82113000
are
named|27468005
based|418836005
on the fungal component,|414561005|246093002
which
plays|300776002
the primary role|63161005|261424001
in determining
the lichen's form.|88996004|246176004|82113000|246176004

The fungus typically|414561005
comprises
the majority
of a lichen's bulk,|88996004|82113000
though
in filamentous
and
gelatinous lichens|373531009|82113000
this
is
not always
the case.|398241000

The lichen fungus|88996004|414561005|82113000|414561005
is
typically
a member|394852005
of the Ascomycota?rarely|415098006|103356009
a member|394852005
of the Basidiomycota,|106559008
and
then
termed
*
*basidiolichens
*
* to
differentiate|263933003
them
from the more common|242762006|72906007
*
*ascolichens
*
*.

Formerly,
some lichen taxonomists|88996004|159139007|82113000|159139007
placed|257557008|421066005
lichens|82113000
in their own division,|118630004
the
*
*Mycophycophyta
*
*,
but
this practice
is
no longer|255511005
accepted|385645004
because
the components|246093002
belong
to
separate|263869007
lineages.

Neither
the ascolichens
nor
the basidiolichens
form|246176004
monophyletic lineages
in their respective fungal phyla,|414561005
but
they
do
form|246176004
several major solely|261028005|255603008
or
primarily lichen-forming groups|88996004|35810008|261586004|88996004|35810008|160481000|82113000|35810008|261586004|82113000|35810008|160481000
within each phylum.

Even more unusual
than basidiolichens
is
the fungus _Geosiphon pyriforme_,|414561005
a member|394852005
of the Glomeromycota
that
is
unique
in
that
it
encloses|68947003
a cyanobacterial symbiont|415101005|284686001
inside its cells.|4421005

_Geosiphon_
is
not usually
considered
to
be
a lichen,|88996004|82113000
and
its peculiar symbiosis|49105004
was
not
recognized
for many years.|258707000

The genus|18511007
is
more closely|242762006
allied
to endomycorrhizal genera.|18511007

Lichens|82113000
are
eaten|48263008
by many different cultures|263735002|252398009|263735002|61594008
across the world.

Although
some lichens|82113000
are
only
eaten|48263008
in times|410669006|417929005
of famine,
others|74964007
are
a staple food|386014009|255620007
or
even
a delicacy.

Two obstacles|420797005
are
often|70232002
encountered
when
eating lichens|48263008|82113000
:
lichen polysaccharides|88996004|71544008|82113000|71544008
are
generally indigestible
to humans,|278412004
and
lichens usually|82113000
contain|42504009
mildly toxic secondary compounds|255604002|2603003|62105006|255604002|81170007|62105006
that
should
be
removed|127485006
before eating.|48263008

Very few lichens|260358002|82113000
are
poisonous,|35331000
but
those high|75540009|371879000
in vulpinic acid|34957004
or
usnic acid|411429007
are
toxic.

Most poisonous lichens|4757001|35331000|82113000
are
yellow.|263935005

In the past Iceland moss|410513005|223667005|421648004
(_Cetraria islandica_
)
was
an important human food|278412004|255620007
in northern Europe,|223502009
and
was
cooked|106373003
as a bread,|226559002
porridge,|226617008
pudding|227682004
,
soup,|227566009
or
salad.|227927005

Wila
(_Bryoria fremontii_
)
was
an important food|255620007
in parts|260726005
of North America,|223503004
where
it
was
usually pitcooked.

Northern peoples|125676002
in North America|223503004
and
Siberia traditionally|223576008
eat|48263008
the partially
digested
reindeer lichen|71087001|88996004|71087001|82113000
(_Cladina_ spp.
)
after
they
remove|127485006
it
from the rumen|45138000
of caribou|71087001
or
reindeer|71087001
that
have
been
killed.|248007002

Rock tripe|227000008
(_Umbilicaria_ spp.

and
_Lasalia_ spp.
)
is
a lichen|88996004|82113000
that
has
frequently|70232002
been
used|394850002
as an emergency food|25876001|255620007
in North America,|223503004
and
one species,|421379005|69658003
_Umbilicaria esculenta_,
is
used|394850002
in a variety
of traditional Korean|263901007|38361009
and
Japanese foods.|414551003|255620007

Many lichens|260396001|82113000
produce
secondary compounds,|2603003|62105006|81170007|62105006
including|55919000
pigments|65863008
that
reduce|260400001
harmful amounts|107651007
of sunlight|49926000
and
powerful toxins|33300005|80917008
that
reduce|260400001
herbivory|284730005
or
kill bacteria.|248007002|409822003

These compounds|62105006
are
very useful|260358002
for lichen identification,|88996004|286672002|88996004|7882003|82113000|286672002|82113000|7882003
and
have
had
economic importance
as dyes|61789006

or
primitive antibiotics.|255631004

Similarly _Peltigera leucophlebia_
was
used|394850002
as a supposed cure
