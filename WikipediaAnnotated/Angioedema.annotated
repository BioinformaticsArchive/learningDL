(

:
*
*angiooedema|400075008
*
*
)
or
*
*Quincke's edema|400075008
*
*
is
the rapid swelling|255358001|423666004|255358001|442672001
(edema|423666004
of the dermis,|53534000
subcutaneous tissue,|67769002|71966008
[1] mucosa|260305007|313268005
and
submucosal tissues.|85756007

It
is
very similar|260358002
to urticaria,|126485001
but
urticaria,|126485001
commonly
known|36692007
as hives,|126485001
occurs|272120004
in the upper dermis.|261183002|53534000

The term
*
*angioneurotic oedema|400075008
*
*
was
used|394850002
for this condition|260905004
in the belief
that there
was
nervous system involvement,|25087005|248448006|278196006|248448006
but
this
is
no longer|255511005
thought to|88952004
be
the case.|398241000

Cases|398241000|413769002
where angioedema|400075008
progresses|385651009
rapidly|418694008
should
be
treated|28995006
as a medical emergency,|74188005|25876001
as
airway obstruction|79688008
and
suffocation|66466001
can
occur.|272120004

Epinephrine|387362001
may
be
life-saving|224130005
when
the cause|134198009
of angioedema|400075008
is
allergic.

In the case|398241000
of hereditary angioedema,|82966003
treatment|276239002|416118004
with epinephrine|387362001
has
not
been
shown
to
be
helpful.

Angioedema|400075008
is
classified|73504009
as
either
hereditary|255404009
or
acquired.|255396000

*
*Acquired angioedema|255396000|400075008
*
*
can
be
immunologic, nonimmunologic,|37523008
or
idiopathic.|54690008

It
is
usually
caused|23981006|134198009
by allergy|408439002|421961002
and
occurs|272120004
together with other allergic symptoms|74964007
and
urticaria.|126485001

It
can
also
occur|272120004
as a side effect
to certain medications,|17162000|410942007
particularly ACE inhibitors.|372733002

*
*Hereditary angioedema** (HAE)|82966003
exists
in three forms,|421291004|246176004
all
of which
are
caused|23981006|134198009
by a genetic mutation|55446002
inherited|255404009
in an autosomal dominant form.|263681008|246176004

They
are
distinguished
by the underlying genetic abnormality.|3950001|276654001|255395001|276654001

Types I|258191002
and
II
are
caused|23981006|134198009
by mutations|55446002
in the _SERPING1_ gene,|67271001
which
result|394617004
in
either
dimished levels|258395000
of the C1-inhibitor protein|441508005
(type I HAE|258191002|82966003
)
or
dysfunctional forms|386585008|246176004
of the same protein|262126009|88878007
(type II HAE|258195006|82966003
).

Type III HAE|258199000|82966003
has
been
linked
with mutations|55446002
in the _F12_ gene,|67271001
which
encodes
the coagulation protein factor XII.|70440005|88878007

All
forms|246176004
of HAE|82966003
lead|88488004
to abnormal activation|263654008
of the complement system,|20823009|246333005
and
all forms|246176004
can
cause|23981006|134198009
swelling|423666004|442672001
elsewhere
in the body,|279495008|123037004
such as the digestive tract.|122865005

If HAE|82966003
involves|248448006
the larynx,|261115001|181212004
it
can
cause|23981006|134198009
life-threatening asphyxiation.|224130005|66466001

The pathogenesis|303109001
of this disorder|64572001
is
suspected to|415684004
be
related|272151006|262094002
to unopposed activation
of the contact pathway|11723008|70862002
by the initial generation|884001|232714002
of kallikrein|66587009
and/or
clotting factor XII|70440005
by damaged endothelial cells.|37782003|45709008

The end product|261782000|422117008
of this cascade,
bradykinin,|56448008
is
produced
in large amounts|255509001|107651007
and
is
believed to
be
the predominant mediator
leading|236874000
to increased vascular permeability|19313000
and
vasodilation|91081006
that
induces|16404004
typical angioedema "|400075008
attacks|216299002
".

[4]|260308009

The skin|119325001|39937001|181469002
of the face,|89545001|302549007
normally
around the mouth,|74262004|123851003|21082005|181220002
and
the mucosa|313268005
of the mouth|74262004|123851003|21082005|181220002
and/or
throat,|54066008|49928004|264231000
as well as
the tongue,|21974007|181226008
swell|423666004|442672001
up over|21481007
the period|259037005
of minutes|258701004|255507004|356624006
to several hours.|261028005|258702006

The swelling|423666004|442672001
can
also
occur|272120004
elsewhere,
typically
in the hands.|85562004

The swelling|423666004|442672001
can
be
itchy|424492005
or
painful.|22253000

There
may
also
be
slightly decreased sensation|425404009|398026008
in the affected areas|247591002|42798000|248448006|42798000
due to compression|71173004|263720003
of the nerves.|3057000

Urticaria|126485001
(hives|126485001
)
may
develop
simultaneously.|79970003

In severe cases,|24484000|398241000|24484000|413769002
stridor|70407001
of the airway|43725001|89187006
occurs|272120004
,
with gasping|23141003
or
wheezy inspiratory breath sounds|56018004|14910006|52653008
and
decreasing oxygen levels.|260371004|24099007|258395000

Tracheal intubation|112798008
is
required
in these situations to
prevent
respiratory arrest|248583008|87317003
and
risk|30207005
of death.|419620001|268923008

Sometimes,
the cause|134198009
is
recent exposure|6493001|71677004|6493001|24932003
to an allergen|90260006
(e.g.|258795003

peanuts,|256349002
but
more often|242762006|70232002
it
is
either idiopathic|54690008
(unknown|261665006
)
or
only weakly|50607009|420295001
correlated
to allergen exposure.|90260006|71677004|90260006|24932003

In hereditary angioedema,|82966003
often|70232002
no direct cause|255589003|134198009
is
identifiable,|7882003
although
mild trauma,|255604002|255604002
including|55919000
dental work|261041009
and
other stimuli,|74964007|8927009
can
cause|23981006|134198009
attacks.|216299002

There
is
usually
no associated itch|47429007|424492005
or
urticaria,|126485001
as
it
is
not
an allergic response.

Patients|116154003
with HAE|82966003
can
also
have
recurrent episodes|263853000
(often|70232002
called "
attacks|216299002
"
)
of abdominal pain,|21522001
usually
accompanied
by intense vomiting,|103370009|249497008
weakness,|13791008|260407003
and
in some cases,|398241000|413769002
watery diarrhea,|263930000|398032003
and
an unraised,
nonitchy splotchy/swirly rash.|271807003

These stomach attacks|69695003|216299002|181246003|216299002
can
last
one to five days|421379005|421820001|258703001
on average,
and
can
require
hospitalization|394656005
for aggressive pain management|61372001|278414003|278414003
and
hydration.|405006006

Abdominal attacks|277112006|216299002
have
also
been
known|36692007
to
cause|23981006|134198009
a significant increase|386134007|260366006
in the patient's white blood cell count,|116154003|767002|116154003|365630000
usually
in the vicinity
of 13,000
to 30,000.

As the symptoms
begin|255395001
to
diminish|1250004
,
the white count slowly|413773004|258734002|419443000|185984009|258734002|419443000|371251000|258734002|419443000
begins|255395001
to
decrease|260400001|260370003
,
returning|7528007
to normal|17621005|258744000
when
the attack subsides.|217315002|216299002

As the symptoms
and
diagnostic tests|103693007
are
almost indistinguishable
from an acute abdomen|9209005
(e.g.|258795003

perforated appendicitis|263837003|74400008|263837003|85189001
it
is
possible|371930009|60022001
for undiagnosed HAE patients to|82966003|116154003
undergo
laparotomy|86481000
(operations|83578000
on the abdomen|277112006|52731004|302553009
)
or
laparoscopy|108191006
(keyhole surgery|83578000
)
that
turns|282987006
out to|255529000
have
been
unnecessary.

HAE|82966003
may
also
cause|23981006|134198009
swelling|423666004|442672001
in a variety
of other locations,|74964007|246267002
most commonly
the limbs,|66019005
genitals,
neck,|45048000|302550007
throat|54066008|49928004|264231000
and
face.|89545001|302549007

The pain|22253000
associated|47429007
with these swellings|423666004|442672001
varies
from mildly uncomfortable|255604002
to agonizing pain,|22253000
depending
on its location|246267002
and
severity.|272141005

Predicting
where
and
when
the next episode|18769003|272128006|255260001|272128006
of edema|423666004
will
occur|272120004
is
impossible.

Most patients|116154003
have
an average
of one episode|421379005|272128006
per month,|258706009|259036001
but
there
are
also patients|116154003
who
have
weekly episodes|14497002|272128006
or
only one|50607009|421379005|420295001|421379005
or
two episodes|420797005|272128006
per year.|258707000|259039008

The triggers
can
vary
and
include|55919000
infections,
minor injuries,|35712008
mechanical irritation,|400068007
operations|83578000
or
stress.|262188008

In most cases,|398241000|413769002
edema|423666004
develops
over a period|259037005
of 12?36 hours|259028005|123035007
and
then
subsides
within 2?5 days.|264655001|258703001

The diagnosis|439401001
is
made
on the clinical picture.|58147004|257444003|58147004|257445002

Routine blood tests|50811001|252275004
(complete blood count,|26604007
electrolytes,|86355000
renal function,|11953005
liver enzymes|259670004|365769003
are
typically
performed.|398166005

Mast cell tryptase levels|130616001|258395000|258395000
may
be
elevated|75540009
if
the attack|217315002|216299002
was
due to an acute allergic|272118002
(anaphylactic) reaction.|39579001

When
the patient|116154003
has
been
stabilized|409051000
,
particular investigations|386053000
may
clarify
the exact cause|134198009
;
complement levels,|20823009|258395000
especially depletion|69251000
of complement factors 2|923009
and
4,
may
indicate|410535002
deficiency|260372006|248325000
of _C1-inhibitor_.|413073007

HAE type III|82966003|258199000
is
a diagnosis|439401001
of exclusion
consisting
of observed angioedema|400075008
along
with normal C1 levels|17621005|258395000|258744000|258395000
and
function.|246464006

The hereditary form|255404009|246176004
(HAE|82966003
)
often goes|70232002
undetected
for a long time,|255511005|410669006
as
its symptoms
resemble
those
of more common disorders,|242762006|72906007|64572001
such as allergy|408439002|421961002
or
intestinal colic.|73063007

An important clue
is
the failure|76797004
of hereditary angioedema to|82966003
respond
to antihistamines|372806008
or
steroids,|116566001
a characteristic
that distinguishes
it
from allergic reactions.|421961002

It
is
particularly difficult to|52925006
diagnose|439401001
HAE|82966003
in patients|116154003
whose episodes|272128006
are
confined
to the gastrointestinal tract.|122865005|279972009

Besides a family history|57177007
of the disease,|64572001
only
a laboratory analysis|261904005|272389005
can
provide
final confirmation.|42796001|74996004

In this analysis,|272389005
it
is
usually
a reduced complement factor C4,|260400001|300899005|260400001|116646001
rather than
the C1-INH deficiency|387472004|260372006|387472004|248325000
itself,
that
is
detected.|260373001

The former|9130008
is
used|394850002
during the reaction cascade|263851003
in the complement system|20823009|246333005
of immune defense,|255386009
which
is
permanently overactive|263829006
due to the lack|41277001
of regulation
by C1-INH.|387472004

Bradykinin|56448008
plays|300776002
a critical role
in all
forms|246176004
of hereditary angioedema.|82966003

This peptide|52642002
is
a potent vasodilator|30207005|372787008
and
increases|260366006
vascular permeability,|40619007
leading|236874000
to rapid accumulation|255358001
of fluid|32457005|33463005|255765007
in the interstitium.

This
is
most obvious|4757001
in the face,|89545001|302549007
where
the skin|119325001|39937001|181469002
has
relatively little supporting connective tissue,|281411007|9096001|181769001|281411007|243114000|181769001|255507004|9096001|181769001|255507004|243114000|181769001
and
edema|423666004
develops
easily.|36203004

Bradykinin|56448008
is
released|68776005|129299003
by various cell types|256220008|4421005|256220008|246238003
in response
to numerous different stimuli|260396001|263735002|8927009
;
it
is
also
a pain mediator.|22253000

Dampening
or
inhibiting bradykinin|61511001|56448008
has
been
shown
to
relieve|397855004
HAE symptoms.|82966003

Various mechanisms|256220008|257544000
that
interfere|78235001
with bradykinin production|56448008
or
degradation|40091007
can
lead|88488004
to angioedema.|400075008

ACE inhibitors|372733002
block|26036001|112232007
ACE,
the enzyme|90668006
that
among other actions,|74964007|129264002
degrades
bradykinin.|56448008

In hereditary angioedema,|82966003
bradykinin formation|56448008|11798007|56448008|255277001
is
caused|23981006|134198009
by continuous activation|255238004
of the complement system|20823009|246333005
due to a deficiency|260372006|248325000
in one|421379005
of its prime inhibitors,|61511001
C1-esterase|27273002
(aka
:
C1-inhibitor|413073007
or
C1INH
)
,
and
continuous production|255238004
of kallikrein,|66587009
another process|415178003
inhibited|61511001
by C1INH.

This serine protease inhibitor (serpin) normally|429935004
inhibits|61511001
the association|263534001|272151006
of C1r
and
C1s
with C1q to
prevent
the formation|11798007|255277001
of the C1-complex,|103360007
which - in turn -|282987006
activates
other proteins|74964007|88878007
of the complement system.|20823009|246333005

Additionally,
it
inhibits|61511001
various proteins|256220008|88878007
of the coagulation cascade,|129390001
although
effects|253861007
of its deficiency|260372006|248325000
on the development|278923009
of hemorrhage|131148009
and
thrombosis|118927008
appear
to
be
limited.|255469002

The three types|421291004|261664005
of hereditary angioedema|82966003
are
:

Angioedema|400075008
can
be
due to antibody formation|68498002|11798007|68498002|255277001|112133008|11798007|112133008|255277001
against C1INH
;
this
is
an autoimmune disorder.|85828009

This acquired angioedema|255396000|400075008
is
associated|47429007
with the development|278923009
of lymphoma.|118600007

Consumption
of foods|255620007
which
are
themselves vasodilators,|372787008
such as alcohol|419442005|53041004|430837008
or
cinnamon,|227388008
can
increase|260366006
the probability|2931005
of an angioedema episode|400075008|272128006
in susceptible patients.|131196009|116154003

If
the episode|272128006
occurs|272120004
at all
after the consumption
of these foods,|255620007
its onset|77374008
may
be
delayed
overnight|255270004
or
by some hours,|258702006
making
the correlation
with their consumption
somewhat difficult|52925006
.

In contrast,
consumption
of bromelain|387219000|130662009
in combination|89780004
with turmeric|227414003
may
be
beneficial
in reducing symptoms.[9]|260400001

The use|277889008|419385000
of ibuprofen|387207008
or
aspirin|387458008
may
increase|260366006
the probability|2931005
of an episode|272128006
in some patients.|116154003

The use|277889008|419385000
of acetaminophen typically|387517004
has
a smaller,|263796003|255507004
but
still
present|52101004|246105001
,
increase|260366006
in the probability|2931005
of an episode.|272128006

In allergic angioedema,|402387002
avoidance
of the allergen|90260006
and
use|277889008|419385000
of antihistamines|372806008
may
prevent
future attacks.|216299002

Cetirizine|372523007
is
a commonly prescribed antihistamine|372806008|373228009
for angioedema.|400075008

Some patients|116154003
have
reported success|229059009|385669000|223458004|385669000
with the combination|89780004
of a nightly low dose|262459003
of cetirizine to|372523007
moderate|6736007
the frequency|260864003|272123002
and
severity|272141005
of attacks,|216299002
followed|367409002
by a much higher dose|242762006|261829003|4757001|261829003
when
an attack|217315002|216299002
does
appear.

Severe angioedema cases|24484000|400075008|398241000|24484000|400075008|413769002
may
require
desensitization|367428009
to the putative allergen,|90260006
as
mortality|409651001
can
occur.|272120004

Chronic cases|90734009|398241000|90734009|413769002
require
steroid therapy,|297279009
which generally
leads|88488004|236874000
to a good response.|20572008

In cases|398241000|413769002
where allergic attack|217315002|216299002
is
progressing|255314001
towards airway obstruction,|79688008
epinephrine|387362001
may
be
life-saving.|224130005

ACE inhibitors|372733002
can
induce|16404004
angioedema.|400075008

ACE inhibitors|372733002
block|26036001|112232007
the enzyme ACE|90668006
so
it
can
no longer|255511005
degrade
bradykinin|56448008
;
thus,
bradykinin|56448008
accumulates
and
causes|134198009
angioedema.|400075008

This complication|116223007|263718001
appears
more common|242762006|72906007
in African-Americans.|15086000

In people|125676002
with ACE inhibitor angioedema,|372733002|400075008
the drug|410942007
needs|410525008|103325001
to
be
discontinued|410546004
and
an alternative treatment|276239002|416118004
needs|410525008|103325001
to
be
found|404684003
,
such as an angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB)[14]|372913009
which
has
a similar mechanism|257544000
but
does
not
affect|4065008
bradykinin.|56448008

However,
this
is
controversial,
as
small studies|255507004|110465008|255507004|224699009
have
shown
patients|116154003
with ACE inhibitor angioedema|372733002|400075008
can
develop
it
with ARBs,
as well.[15][16]|20572008

In hereditary angioedema,|82966003
specific stimuli|69658003|8927009
that
have
previously
led|88488004|236874000
to attacks|216299002
may
need|410525008|103325001
to
be
avoided
in the future.

It
does
not
respond
to antihistamines,|372806008
corticosteroids,|79440004
or
epinephrine.|387362001

Acute treatment|272118002|276239002|272118002|416118004
consists
of C1-INH concentrate|387472004
from donor blood,|105470007
which
must
be
administered|418283001
intravenously.

In an emergency,|25876001
fresh frozen blood plasma,|346447007|87612001|346447007|119273009
which also
contains|42504009
C1-INH,|387472004
can
also
be
used.|394850002

However,
in most European countries,|223633000
C1-INH concentrate|387472004
is
only available|50607009|103328004|420295001|103328004
to patients|116154003
who
are
participating
in special programmes.|67995009

Future attacks|216299002
of hereditary angioedema|82966003
can
be
prevented|116699007
by the use|277889008|419385000
of androgens|66349002
such as danazol,|126124009
oxandrolone|126128007
or
methyltestosterone.|126161000

These agents|260872001
increase|260366006
the level|258395000|276625007
of aminopeptidase P,|79531001
an enzyme|90668006
that
inactivates
kinins
;[17] kinins
(especially bradykinin|56448008
)
are
responsible|394851003
for the manifestations|250255003|251190009
of angioedema.|400075008

In acquired angioedema,|255396000|400075008
HAE types I|82966003|258191002
and
II,
and
nonhistaminergic angioedema,|400075008
antifibrinolytics
such as tranexamic acid|386960009
or ?-aminocaproic acid|59882007
may
be
effective.|255403003|254648000

Cinnarizine|395955001
may
also
be
useful
because
it
blocks|26036001
the activation
of C4
and
can
be
used|394850002
in patients|116154003
with liver disease,|235856003

androgens|66349002

Dr.|309343006

Heinrich Quincke
first
described
the clinical picture|58147004|257444003|58147004|257445002
of angioedema|400075008
in 1882,
[18]
though
there
had
been
some earlier descriptions|264499004
of the condition.[19][20][21]|260905004

Sir William Osler
remarked
in 1888
that
some cases|398241000|413769002
may
have
a hereditary basis|255404009|255404009|418836005
;
he
coined
the term "hereditary angio-neurotic edema".[22]|82966003

The link
with C1 esterase inhibitor deficiency|82966003
was
proved|277025001
in 1963.[23]|264657009
