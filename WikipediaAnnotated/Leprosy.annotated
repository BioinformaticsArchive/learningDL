known|36692007
as

(

)
,
is
a chronic disease|27624003
caused|23981006|134198009
by the bacteria _Mycobacterium leprae_|409822003|58242002
and
_Mycobacterium lepromatosis_.|243368001

Named|27468005
after physician Gerhard Armauer Hansen,|309343006
leprosy|81004002
is
primarily
a granulomatous disease|128561003
of the peripheral nerves|84782009
and
mucosa|313268005
of the upper respiratory tract|58675001|361381009
;
skin lesions|95324001
are
the primary external sign.|63161005|261074009|72670004|261424001|261074009|72670004

Left|7771000
untreated, leprosy|25265005|81004002
can
be
progressive,|255314001
causing|23981006
permanent damage|6934004|37782003
to the skin,|119325001|39937001|181469002
nerves,|3057000
limbs|66019005
and
eyes.|81745001

Contrary
to folklore,
leprosy|81004002
does
not
cause|23981006|134198009
body parts to fall off,|38866009|1912002
although
they
can
become
numb
or
diseased|64572001
as a result|394617004
of secondary infections|264569006
;
these
occur|272120004
as a result|394617004
of the body's defenses|279495008|123037004
being
compromised
by the primary disease.|56416009

Secondary infections,|264569006
in turn,|282987006
can
result|394617004
in tissue loss causing fingers|85756007|23981006|7569003|85756007|23981006|259052003
and
toes|29707007
to
become
shortened|359530003
and
deformed
,
as
cartilage|61496007
is
absorbed
into the body.[4][5][6]|279495008|123037004

Leprosy|81004002
has
affected humanity|247591002|278412004|248448006|278412004
for over 4,000 years,|21481007|258707000
[7]
and
was
recognized
in the civilizations
of ancient China,|223581004
Egypt|223511009
and
India.|223600005

In 1995,
the World Health Organization (WHO)|263775005|21139007
estimated|414135002
that
between 2|260306008
and
3 million people|260313008|125676002
were
permanently
disabled
because of leprosy|81004002
at
that time.|410669006

In the past 20 years,|410513005|258707000
15 million people worldwide|125676002
have
been
cured
of leprosy.|81004002

Although
the forced quarantine|170499009|263760002|170499009
or
segregation
of patients|116154003
is
unnecessary
in places|257557008
where adequate treatments|51117008|276239002|88323005|276239002
are
available,|103328004
many leper colonies still|258736000
remain
around the world
in countries|223369002
such as India|223600005
(
where there
are
still more
than 1,000 leper colonies|260305007|258736000
)

Nepal,|223602002
Somalia,|223528007
Liberia,|223562007
Vietnam,|223595001
[13]
and
Japan.|223583001

Leprosy|81004002
was
once
believed
to
be
highly contagious|75540009
and
was
treated|28995006
with mercury ?|45262002
all
of which
applied|410618006
to syphilis,|76272004
which
was
first|255216001|232714002
described
in 1530.

It
is
possible|371930009|60022001
that
many early cases|264499004|398241000|264499004|413769002
thought|88952004
to
be
leprosy|81004002
could
have
actually
been
syphilis.[15]|76272004

The age-old social stigma[16]|424144002|70753007|9097005
associated|47429007
with the advanced form|86005002|246176004
of leprosy lingers|81004002
in many areas,|42798000
and
remains
a major obstacle|255603008
to self-reporting|223458004
and
early treatment.|264499004|276239002|264499004|416118004

Effective treatment|255403003|276239002|255403003|416118004|254648000|276239002|254648000|416118004
for leprosy|81004002
appeared
in the late 1930s|260383002
with the introduction|107733003
of dapsone|387096002
and
its derivatives.

Leprosy bacilli|58242002
resistant|30714006
to dapsone soon|387096002
evolved|59381007
and
,
due to overuse
of dapsone,|387096002
became
widespread.|85333001

It
was
not
until the introduction|107733003
of multidrug therapy (MDT)|276239002
in the early 1980s|264499004
that
the disease|64572001
could
be
diagnosed|439401001
and
treated|28995006
successfully
within the community.[17]|133928008

MDT
for multibacillary leprosy|416257001
consists
of rifampicin,|387159009
dapsone,|387096002
and
clofazimine|387410004
taken|419652001
over 12 months.|258706009

Dosages|277406006
adjusted|410617001
appropriately
for children|410601007|160499008
and
adults|133936004
are
available|103328004
in all primary health centres|63161005|264361005|261424001|264361005
in the form|246176004
of blister packages.|408764000|247464001|417237009

Single dose MDT|125681006|277406006|125681006|408102007|50607009|277406006|50607009|408102007
for single lesion leprosy|300580009|81004002
consists
of rifampicin,|387159009
ofloxacin,|387551000
and
minocycline.|372653009

The move|302000008|384598002|370125004
toward single-dose treatment strategies|125681006|277406006|276239002|125681006|277406006|416118004|125681006|408102007|276239002|125681006|408102007|416118004|50607009|277406006|276239002|50607009|277406006|416118004|50607009|408102007|276239002|50607009|408102007|416118004
has
reduced|260400001
the prevalence
of disease|64572001
in some regions,|410673009
since
prevalence
is
dependent|371154000
on duration|103335007
of treatment.|276239002|416118004

World Leprosy Day|81004002|258703001|81004002|259032004
was
created
to
draw
awareness|312012004
to leprosy|81004002
and
its sufferers.

There
are
several different approaches|261028005|263735002|261028005|263735002|103379005
for classifying leprosy|73504009|81004002
;
however,
parallels
exist.

There
is
a difference|263735002
in immune response|35024006
to the tuberculoid|371569005
and
lepromatous forms.[22]|64357001|246176004

Hansen's disease|81004002
may
also
be
divided|422033008
into the following types|255260001|261664005
:
[23]|264657009
:
344-346

This disease|64572001
may
also
occur|272120004
with only neural involvement,|50607009|3057000|248448006|50607009|256864008|248448006|420295001|3057000|248448006|420295001|256864008|248448006
without skin lesions.|95324001

This disease|64572001
is
also
known|36692007
as Hansen's Disease.|81004002

Skin lesions|95324001
are
the primary external sign.|63161005|261074009|72670004|261424001|261074009|72670004

Left|7771000
untreated, leprosy|25265005|81004002
can
be
progressive,|255314001
causing|23981006
permanent damage|6934004|37782003
to the skin,|119325001|39937001|181469002
nerves,|3057000
limbs,|66019005
and
eyes.|81745001

Diagnosis|439401001
in the U.S.|223688001

is
often|70232002
delayed
because
healthcare providers
are
unaware|418107008|406124004
of leprosy|81004002
and
its symptoms.

Early diagnosis|264499004|439401001|264499004
and
treatment|276239002|416118004
prevents|116699007
nerve involvement,|3057000|248448006|256864008|248448006
the hallmark
of leprosy,|81004002
and
the disability|21134002
it causes.[29]|134198009

There
are
many kinds|260396001|261664005
of leprosy|81004002
but
there
are
common symptoms,|72906007
including|55919000
:
runny nose|267101005
;
dry scalp|13880007|41695006|13880007|181480002
;
eye problems
;
skin lesions|95324001
;
muscle weakness|26544005
;
reddish skin|119325001|39937001|181469002
;
smooth shiny diffuse thickening|82280004|19648000|263899003
of facial skin,|73897004
ear,|117590005|1910005
and
hand|85562004|302539009
;
loss
of sensation|106148006|271712005|272144002
in fingers|7569003|259052003
and
toes|29707007
;
thickening|263899003
of peripheral nerves|84782009
;
and
flat nose|6041008|260540009|6041008|181195007|257564005|260540009|257564005|181195007
due to destruction|64597002
of nasal cartilage.|16178009|278941001

There
is
also phonation|43914001
and
resonation
of sound|68325009
during speech.

Often there|70232002
is
atrophy|13331008
of the testes|36528006|279572002
and
impotency.|397803000

_Mycobacterium leprae_|58242002
and
_Mycobacterium lepromatosis_|243368001
are
the causative agents|362944004
of leprosy.|81004002

_M.|258311008

lepromatosis_
is
a relatively newly identified mycobacterium|7882003|243368001
isolated|46651001
from a fatal case|399166001|398241000
of diffuse lepromatous leprosy|240404002
in 2008.[2][3]

An intracellular, acid-fast bacterium,|83167003|406976001|409822003
_M.|258311008

leprae_
is
aerobic|27471002
and
rod-shaped,|17139002|107644003|17139002|300842002
and
is
surrounded|355648006
by the waxy cell membrane|69637009|53982002|41508009|53982002
coating|228224007
characteristic
of _Mycobacterium_ species.[30]|243368001|131339006

Due to extensive loss|41118005
of genes|67271001
necessary
for independent growth,|371153006
_M.|258311008

leprae_
and
_M.|258311008

lepromatosis_
are
obligate pathogens,|264418008
and
unculturable
in the laboratory,|261904005
a factor
that
leads|88488004|236874000
to difficulty|371157007
in definitively
identifying|7882003
the organism|410653004
under a strict interpretation|280452008
of Koch's postulates.

The use|277889008|419385000
of non-culture-based techniques|252398009|272394005|252398009|418836005|272394005|61594008|272394005|61594008|418836005|272394005
such as molecular genetics|290005005
has
allowed
for alternative establishment
of causation.

While
the causative organisms|410653004
have
to date|410671006
been
impossible
to culture _|252398009|61594008
in vitro_,
it
has
been
possible to|371930009|60022001
grow
them
in animals.|387961004

Charles
Shepard,
chairman
of the United States Leprosy Panel,|223688001|81004002|261586004
successfully
grew
the organisms|410653004
in the footpads
of mice|447612001|447482001
in 1960.

This method|260686004|272394005
was
improved|385425000|3442003
with the use|277889008|419385000
of congenitally athymic mice|447612001|447482001
(nude mice|447612001|447482001
in 1970
by Joseph Colson
and
Richard Hilson
at St George's Hospital,|285201006
London.

A second animal model|81170007|387961004|257997001|387961004|288495006|387961004
was
developed
by Eleanor Nuts|13577000
at the Gulf South Research Institute.|385437003

Dr Storrs|309343006
had
worked|261041009
on the nine-banded armadillo|63724009
for her PhD,
because
this animal|387961004
had
a lower body temperature|128263001|105723007|128263001|246508008|261122009|105723007
than humans|278412004
and
might
therefore
be
a suitable animal model.|387961004

The work|261041009
started|385652002
in 1968
with material|260769002
provided
by Waldemar Kirchheimer
at the United States Public Health Leprosarium|223688001|310115006
in Carville,
Louisiana.|224063000

These experiments
proved|277025001
unsuccessful,|385671000
but
additional work|260364009|261041009
in 1970
with material|260769002
provided
by Chapman Binford,
medical director|74188005
of the Leonard's Wood Memorial,|14402002
was
successful.|385669000

The papers|50833004
describing
this model
led|88488004|236874000
to a dispute|9182005
of priority.|260870009

Further controversy|46053002
was
generated
when
it
was
discovered
that wild armadillos|262290003|106947002
in Louisiana|224063000
were
naturally
infected
with leprosy.|81004002

Naturally
occurring|272120004
infection also
has
been
reported|229059009|223458004
in non-human primates|278412004|388073004
including|55919000
the African chimpanzee,|413464008|1480007|413464008|389223000
sooty mangabey,|87877000
and
cynomolgus macaque.|19422000|389173008

It
is
believed
that
around 95%
of people|125676002
are
naturally immune.|255386009

Recent research|6493001
suggests
that there
is
a defect|6920004
in cell-mediated immunity|4421005|73510009|58915005|362837007|73510009|58915005
that
causes|134198009
susceptibility|76522002|118588007
to Hansen's disease.|81004002

The region|410673009
of DNA|24851008
responsible|394851003
for this variability|255372005
is
also
involved|248448006
in Parkinson disease,|49049000
giving|419582001
rise
to current speculation|15240007
that
the two disorders|420797005|64572001
may
be
linked
in some way
at the biochemical level.[34]|80534008|258395000|80534008|276625007

Several genes|261028005|67271001
have
been
associated|47429007
with a susceptibility|76522002|118588007
to leprosy|81004002
:

At highest risk|15508007
are
those living
in endemic areas|42798000
with poor conditions|11403006|260905004|255351007|260905004
such as inadequate bedding,|71978007
contaminated water,|102414000
and
insufficient diet,|71978007|41829006|423437008|41829006
or
other diseases|74964007|64572001
that
compromise
immune function.

Professional studies|110465008|224699009
show
little evidence|18669006
that HIV|19030005|86406008|402916007
is
an important factor
in increasing|260369004
the risk|30207005
of leprosy infection,|81004002
[35][36]
but
the potential|30207005
is
under active review.[37][38]|261089000|55561003|264670000

Although
the mode
of transmission|258150004
of Hansen's disease|81004002
remains
uncertain,|64957009
most investigators

Studies|110465008|224699009
have
shown
that leprosy|81004002
can
be
transmitted|60117003|258150004
to humans|278412004
by armadillos.|106947002

Leprosy|81004002
is
not
known|36692007
to
be
either
sexually|365952006
transmitted|60117003|258150004
or
highly infectious|75540009
after treatment.|276239002|416118004

Approximately 95%|26175008
of people|125676002
are
naturally immune|255386009
and
sufferers
are
no longer infectious|255511005
after
as
little|281411007|255507004
as 2 weeks|260306008|258705008
of treatment.[43]|276239002|416118004

The minimum incubation period|255605001|406646006|255604002|406646006
reported|229059009|223458004
is
as short|359530003|367450005
as a few weeks,|57176003|258705008
based|418836005
on the very occasional occurrence|260358002|84638005|272120004
of leprosy|81004002
among young infants.|84422007|418119000

The maximum incubation period|398303009|406646006
reported|229059009|223458004
is
as long|255511005
as 30 years,|258707000
or
over,|21481007
as
observed
among war veterans
known|36692007
to
have
been
exposed|24932003
for short periods|248967002
in endemic areas|42798000
but
otherwise
living|224130005|419749002
in non-endemic areas.|42798000

It
is
generally
agreed
that
the average incubation period|406646006
is
between three|421291004
and
five years.|421820001|258707000

The mechanism|257544000
of transmission|258150004
of leprosy|81004002
is
prolonged|255224006
close|29179001
contact|11723008|70862002
and
transmission|258150004
by nasal droplet.|260540009

In addition|260364009
to humans,|278412004
leprosy|81004002
has
been
observed
in nine-banded armadillo,|63724009
(
which,
it
has
recently|6493001
been
confirmed|59156000
,
are
among the primary sources|63161005|260753009|261424001|260753009
of new cases|7147002|398241000|7147002|413769002
of leprosy|81004002
in Americans[44]
)
,
and
three species|421291004|69658003
of primates.|388073004

The bacterium|409822003
can
also
be
grown
in the laboratory|261904005
by injection|28289002|385218009|129326001
into the footpads
of mice.|447612001|447482001

There
is
evidence|18669006
that
not
all people|125676002
who
are
infected
with _M.|258311008

leprae_
develop
leprosy,|81004002
and
genetic factors|3950001|255395001
have
long|255511005
been
thought|88952004
to
play|300776002
a role,
due to the observation|103705002
of clustering
of leprosy|81004002
around certain families,|17162000|35359004
and
the failure to|76797004
understand|66216009
why certain individuals|17162000|125676002|17162000|385435006
develop
lepromatous leprosy|21560005
while
others|74964007
develop
other types|74964007|261664005
of leprosy.|81004002

It
is
estimated|414135002
that
due to genetic factors,|3950001|255395001
only 5%|50607009|420295001
of the population|385436007|389109008
is
susceptible|131196009
to leprosy.|81004002

This
is
mostly
because
the body|279495008|123037004
is
naturally immune|255386009
to the bacteria,|409822003
and
those persons|125676002
that
do
become
infected experience severe allergic reactions|24484000|421961002
to the disease.|64572001

However,
the role
of genetic factors|3950001|255395001
is
not entirely
clear|263707001
in determining
this clinical expression.|58147004|10012005

In addition,|260364009
malnutrition|248325000
and
prolonged exposure|255224006|71677004|255224006|24932003
to infected persons|125676002
may
play|300776002
a role
in development|278923009
of the overt disease.|64572001

The most widely held belief|4757001|421139008
is
that
the disease|64572001
is
transmitted|60117003|258150004
by contact|11723008|70862002
between infected persons|125676002
and
healthy persons.|263775005|125676002

In general, closeness|60132005|29179001
of contact|11723008|70862002
is
related|272151006|262094002
to the dose|277406006|408102007
of infection,
which in turn|282987006
is
related|272151006|262094002
to the occurrence|272120004
of disease.|64572001

Of the various situations|256220008
that
promote
close contact,|29179001|11723008|29179001|70862002
contact|11723008|70862002
within the household
is
the only|50607009|420295001
one|421379005
that
is
easily|36203004
identified|7882003
,
although
the incidence
among contacts|11723008|70862002
and
the relative risk|125677006|30207005|29920004|30207005
for them
appear
to
vary
considerably
in different studies.|263735002|110465008|263735002|224699009

In incidence studies,|110465008|224699009
infection rates
for contacts|11723008|70862002
of lepromatous leprosy|21560005
have
varied
from 6.2
per 1000
per year|258707000|259039008
in Cebu,|223763004
Philippines[50]|223592003
to 53
per 1000
per year|258707000|259039008
in part|260726005
of Western India|223600005
to 55.8|264691008
per 1000
per year|258707000|259039008
in a part|260726005
of Southern India.[51]|223600005

Two exit routes|420797005|5173006
of _M.|258311008

leprae_
from the human body often|279495008|70232002|281189005|70232002
described
are
the skin|119325001|39937001|181469002
and
the nasal mucosa,|34508005|310211009
although
their relative importance|125677006|29920004
is
not
clear.|263707001

Lepromatous cases|64357001|398241000|64357001|413769002
show
large numbers|255509001|410680006|255509001|410681005
of organisms|410653004
deep|131197000
in the dermis,|53534000
but
whether
they
reach|282679008
the skin surface|119325001|410678000|39937001|410678000|181469002|410678000
in sufficient numbers|51117008|410680006|51117008|410681005
is
doubtful.

Although
there
are
reports|229059009|223458004
of acid-fast bacilli|243365003
being
found|404684003
in the desquamating epithelium|31610004
(sloughing|44015005
of superficial layer|26283006
of skin|119325001|39937001|181469002
)
of the skin,|119325001|39937001|181469002
Weddell _
et
al._
had
reported|229059009|223458004
in 1963
that
they
could
not
find
any acid-fast bacilli|243365003
in the epidermis,|55988001
even
after
examining|64049009
a very large number|258262008|410680006|258262008|410681005
of specimens|123038009
from patients|116154003
and
contacts.|11723008|70862002

In a recent study,|6493001|110465008|6493001|224699009
Job _|14679004
et
al._
found|404684003
fairly large numbers|255509001|410680006|255509001|410681005
of _M.|258311008

leprae_
in the superficial keratin layer|26283006|280690006
of the skin|119325001|39937001|181469002
of lepromatous leprosy patients,|21560005|116154003
suggesting
that
the organism|410653004
could
exit|5173006
along
with the sebaceous secretions.[53]|46242002

The importance
of the nasal mucosa|34508005|310211009
was
recognized
as early|264499004
as 1898
by Sch?ffer,|403967000
in particular
that
of the ulcerated mucosa.|429040005|313268005

The quantity|107651007
of bacilli|44762009|416207009
from nasal mucosal lesions|301191003|313268005
in lepromatous leprosy|21560005
was
demonstrated
by Shepard
as large,|255509001
with counts|258734002
ranging
from 10,000
to 10,000,000.

Pedley
reported|229059009|223458004
that
the majority
of lepromatous patients|64357001|116154003
showed
leprosy bacilli|58242002
in their nasal secretions|260540009|46242002|46242002
as
collected
through blowing
the nose.|260540009|181195007

Davey
and
Rees
indicated|410535002
that nasal secretions|260540009|46242002|46242002
from lepromatous patients|64357001|116154003
could
yield
as much|242762006|4757001
as 10 million viable organisms|263927007|410653004
per day.[57]|258703001|259032004

The entry route|284009009
of _M.|258311008

leprae_
into the human body|279495008|281189005
is
also
not definitively
known|36692007
:
The skin|119325001|39937001|181469002
and
the upper respiratory tract|58675001|361381009
are
most likely.|4757001|2931005

While
older research dealt|70753007
with the skin route,
recent research|6493001
has
increasingly
favored
the respiratory route.|258162000|284009009|258162000|449071006|284009009|449071006

Rees
and
McDougall
succeeded
in the experimental transmission|258150004
of leprosy|81004002
through aerosols|64242006|52262001
containing|42504009
_M.|258311008

leprae_
in immune-suppressed mice,|255386009|245780008|447612001|255386009|245780008|447482001
suggesting
a similar possibility
in humans.|278412004

Successful results|385669000|394617004
have
also
been
reported|229059009|223458004
on experiments
with nude mice|447612001|447482001
when
_M.|258311008

leprae_
were
introduced|127487003
into the nasal cavity|279549004|263481003
by topical application.|410618006|359540000|410618006

In summary,
entry
through the respiratory route|258162000|284009009|258162000|449071006|284009009|449071006
appears
the most probable route,|4757001|2931005|284009009|4757001|2931005
although
other routes,|74964007
particularly broken skin,|7919002
cannot
be
ruled|10828004
out.|255529000

The CDC
notes
the following assertion|255260001|397747003
about the transmission|258150004
of the disease|64572001
:
"_
Although
the mode
of transmission|258150004
of Hansen's disease|81004002
remains
uncertain,|64957009
most investigators
think|88952004
that_ M.|258311008

leprae _
is
usually
spread|410677005
from person|125676002
to person|125676002
in respiratory droplets_."[60]|258162000|449071006

In leprosy,|81004002
both
the reference
points
for measuring|258104002|263571004
the incubation period|406646006
and
the times|410669006|417929005
of infection
and
onset|77374008
of disease|64572001
are
difficult to|52925006
define
,
the former|9130008
because of the lack|41277001
of adequate immunological tools|51117008|37523008|86967005|88323005|37523008|86967005
and
the latter
because of the disease's slow onset.|217315002|419443000

Even so,
several investigators|261028005
have
attempted
to
measure|246445000|272391002
the incubation period|406646006
for leprosy.|81004002

The minimum incubation period|255605001|406646006|255604002|406646006
reported|229059009|223458004
is
as short|359530003|367450005
as a few weeks|57176003|258705008
and
this
is
based|418836005
on the very occasional occurrence|260358002|84638005|272120004
of leprosy|81004002
among young infants.|84422007|418119000

The maximum incubation period|398303009|406646006
reported|229059009|223458004
is
as long|255511005
as 30 years,|258707000
or
over,|21481007
as
observed
among war veterans
known|36692007
to
have

It

that
the average incubation period|406646006
is
between three|421291004

five years.|421820001|258707000

In a recent trial,|6493001|110465008
a single dose|125681006|277406006|125681006|408102007|50607009|277406006|50607009|408102007
of rifampicin|387159009
reduced|260400001
the rate
at which
contacts|11723008|70862002
acquired leprosy|255396000|81004002
in the two years|420797005|258707000

265 treatments|276239002

prevented|116699007
one case|421379005|398241000
of leprosy|81004002
in this period.|259037005

A non-randomized study|110465008|224699009
found|404684003
that rifampicin|387159009
reduced|260400001
the number|410680006|410681005
of new cases|7147002|398241000|7147002|413769002

Efforts to|19487008
overcome
persistent obstacles
to the elimination|63911002
of the disease|64572001
include|55919000
improving detection,|385633008
educating|409073007
patients|116154003
and
the population|385436007|389109008
about its cause,|134198009
and
fighting social taboos|248005005
about a disease|64572001
that
has
caused|23981006|134198009
its patients|116154003
throughout history to|392521001

considered
"unclean"

discrimination.|311718005

The lack|41277001
of awareness|312012004
about Hansen's disease|81004002

lead|88488004
people to|125676002

In 1988,
Jacinto Convit
was
nominated
for the Nobel Prize
in Medicine,|410942007
for developing
a vaccine|398827000

Enough synthetic pharmaceuticals|421967003
that
are

in 1993 recommended two types|420797005|261664005
of standard MDT regimen
be
adopted.|160496001

The first|255216001|232714002
was
a 24-month treatment|258706009|276239002|258706009|416118004|259036001|276239002|259036001|416118004
for multibacillary
(MB
or
lepromatous|64357001
)
cases|398241000|413769002
using|260676000
rifampicin,|387159009
clofazimine,|387410004
and
dapsone.|387096002

The second|81170007|257997001|288495006
was
a six-month treatment|422218008|258706009|276239002|422218008|258706009|416118004|422218008|259036001|276239002|422218008|259036001|416118004
for paucibacillary
(PB
or
tuberculoid|371569005
)
cases,|398241000|413769002
using|260676000
rifampicin|387159009
and
dapsone.|387096002

At the First International Conference|255216001|232714002
on the Elimination|63911002
of Leprosy|81004002
as a Public Health Problem,|310115006|55607006
held|421139008
in Hanoi
the next year,|18769003|258707000|18769003|259039008|255260001|258707000|255260001|259039008
the global strategy|60132005
was
endorsed
and
funds
provided
to WHO
for the procurement
and
supply|425398004
of MDT
to all endemic countries.|223369002

Between 1995
and
1999,
WHO,
with the aid|246088000
of the Nippon Foundation|418836005
(Chairman Y?hei Sasakawa,
World Health Organization Goodwill Ambassador|263775005|21139007
for Leprosy Elimination|81004002|63911002
)
,
supplied|425398004
all endemic countries|223369002
with free MDT|37837009
in blister packs,|408764000|257260002|247464001|257260002|417237009|257260002
channelled|255592004
through Ministries of Health.|263775005

This free provision|37837009
was
extended|255536004|288467006|255590007
in 2000
and
again
in 2005
with donations
by the MDT manufacturer Novartis
through WHO.

In the latest agreement|260383002
signed|72670004
between the company
and
WHO
in October 2010,
the provision
of free MDT|37837009
by WHO
to all endemic countries|223369002
will
now
run|418060005|282476009
until
at least
the end|261782000|422117008
of 2015.

At the national level,|258395000|276625007
non-government organizations (NGOs)|21139007
affiliated
to the national programme
will
continue|255238004
to
be
provided
with an appropriate free supply|37837009|425398004
of this
WHO
supplied|425398004
MDT
by the government.

MDT
remains
highly effective,|75540009|255403003|75540009|254648000
and
patients|116154003
are
no longer infectious|255511005
after the first monthly dose.|255216001|89185003|277406006|255216001|89185003|408102007|232714002|89185003|277406006|232714002|89185003|408102007

It
is
safe
and
easy to|36203004
use|277889008|419385000
under field|255798002
conditions|78326006|260905004
due to its presentation|246105001
in calendar blister packs.|408764000|257260002|247464001|257260002|417237009|257260002

Relapse rates|263855007|255318003|58184002
remain
low,|62482003|371880002
and
there
is
no known resistance|36692007|30714006
to the combined drugs.|89780004|410942007

The Seventh|86777004
WHO Expert Committee
on Leprosy,|81004002
[67] reporting|223458004
in 1997,
concluded
that
the MB duration|103335007
of treatment ? then|276239002|416118004
standing|10904000
at 24 months ?|258706009
could
safely
be
shortened|359530003
to 12 months "|258706009
without significantly
compromising
its efficacy."

The disease|64572001
was
known|36692007
in Ancient Greece|223651004
as elephantiasis
(elephantiasis graecorum
).

At various|256220008
times blood|87612001|119273009
was
considered
to
be
a treatment|276239002|416118004
either
as a beverage
or
as a bath._[citation
needed|410525008|103325001

That
of virgins|309842008
or
children|410601007|160499008
was
considered
to
be
especially potent._[citation|30207005
needed|410525008|103325001

This practice
seems
to
have
originated
with the Ancient Egyptians|1919006
but
was
also
known|36692007
in China.|223581004

This practice
persisted
until
at least 1790,|276139006|263796003
when
the use|277889008|419385000
of dog blood|448771007|87612001|448771007|119273009|87612001|119273009
was
mentioned
in _
De Secretis Naturae_.

Paracelsus
recommended
the use|277889008|419385000
of lamb's blood|425953004|87612001|425953004|119273009
and
even blood|87612001|119273009
from dead bodies|419620001|279495008|419620001|123037004
was
used.|394850002

Snakes|107280007
were
also
used|394850002
,
according to Pliny,
Aretaeus
of Cappadocia,
and
Theodorus.

Gaucher recommended treatment|276239002|416118004
with cobra venom.|78221003

Boinet,
in 1913,
tried increasing doses|260369004|277406006
of bee stings|241820008
(
up to 4000
).

Scorpions|106864000
and
frogs|47843009
were
used|394850002
occasionally
instead of snakes.|107280007

The excreta|63911002
of _Anabas_
(
the climbing fish|284097000|90580008
)
was
also
tried.

Alternative treatments|276239002
included|55919000
scarification|16646002
with
or
without the addition|260364009
of irritants|412453003
including|55919000
arsenic|413576005
and
hellebore.|84957003

Castration|236334001
was
also
practiced
in the Middle Ages.|28288005

A common pre-modern treatment|72906007|236874000|276239002|72906007|236874000|416118004|72906007|272113006|276239002|72906007|272113006|416118004
of leprosy|81004002
was
chaulmoogra oil.|53022002

The oil|21847005|421890007
has
long|255511005
been
used|394850002
in India|223600005
as
an Ayurvedic medicine|410942007
for the treatment|276239002|416118004
of leprosy|81004002
and
various skin conditions.|256220008|95320005

It
has
also
been
used|394850002
in China|223581004
and
Burma,|223587000
and
was
introduced|127487003
to the West
by Frederic John Mouat,
a professor
at Bengal Medical College.|261701009|74188005|224864007

He
tried
the oil|21847005|421890007
as an oral|260548002
and
topical agent|419487009
in two cases|420797005|398241000|420797005|413769002
of leprosy|81004002
and
reported significant improvements|229059009|386134007|223458004|386134007
in an 1854 paper.[68]|50833004|264697007

This paper|50833004
caused|23981006|134198009
some confusion.|286933003

Mouat
indicated|410535002
that
the oil|21847005|421890007
was
the product
of a tree _Chaulmoogra odorata_,|22097005
which
had
been
described
in 1815
by William Roxburgh,
a surgeon|304292004
and
naturalist,
while
he
was
cataloging
the plants|31006001
in the East India Company?s botanical garden|223600005
in Calcutta.

This tree|22097005
is
also
known|36692007
as
_Gynocardia odorata_.

For the rest|258157001
of the 19th century,
this tree|22097005
was
thought|88952004
to
be
the source|260753009
of the oil.|21847005|421890007

In 1901,
Sir David Prain
identified|7882003
the true chaulmoogra seeds|31874001|264337003
of the Calcutta bazaar
and
of the Paris|7074004
and
London apothecaries
as coming
from _Taraktogenos kurzii_,
which
is
found|404684003
in Burma|223587000
and
Northeast India.|223600005

The oil|21847005|421890007
mentioned
in the Ayurvedic texts
was
from the tree _Hydnocarpus wightiana_,|22097005
known|36692007
as
_Tuvakara_
in Sanskrit
and
_chaulmugra_
in Hindi
and
Persian.

The first parenteral administration|255216001|413454004|255216001|416118004|232714002|413454004|232714002|416118004
was
given|419582001
by the Egyptian doctor Tortoulis Bey,|297308004|309343006|1919006|309343006
personal physician|309343006
to the Sultan Hussein Kamel
of Egypt.|223511009

He
had
been
using|260676000
subcutaneous injections|32282008
of creosote|111093005
for tuberculosis|371569005
and
in 1894 administered subcutaneous injection|418283001|32282008
of chaulmoogra oil|53022002
in a 36-year-old Egyptian Copt|258707000|70753007|297308004|258707000|70753007|1919006|259039008|70753007|297308004|259039008|70753007|1919006
who
had
been
unable to|371151008
tolerate
oral treatment.|260548002|276239002|260548002|416118004

After 6 years|258707000
and
584 injections,|28289002|129326001
the patient|116154003
was
declared
cured.

An early scientific analysis|264499004|272389005
of the oil|21847005|421890007
was
carried|288345009
out
by [Frederick B.

Power]|33300005
(/w/index.php?title|419205000
=Frederick_B._Power&action|33300005|129264002

)
in London
in 1904.

He
and
his colleagues
isolated|46651001
a new unsaturated fatty acid|7147002|21625008
from the seeds,|264337003
which
they
named|27468005
'chaulmoogric acid'.|34957004

They also
investigated|116698004
two closely related species|420797005|272151006|69658003|420797005|262094002|69658003
:
_Hydnocarpus anthelmintica_
and
_Hydnocarpus wightiana_.

From these two trees|420797005|22097005
they
isolated|46651001
both
chaulmoogric acid|34957004
and
a closely related compound,|272151006|62105006|262094002|62105006
'hydnocarpus acid'.|34957004

They also
investigated|116698004
_Gynocardia odorata_
and
found|404684003
that
it
produced
neither
of these acids.|34957004

Later investigation|260383002|386053000
showed
that 'taraktogenos'
(_Hydnocarpus kurzii_
)
also
produced
chaulmoogric acid.|34957004

Another difficulty|371157007
with the use|277889008|419385000
of this oil|21847005|421890007
was
administration.|413454004|416118004

Taken|419652001
orally|260548002
it
is
extremely nauseating.|422587007

Given|419582001
by enema|61919008|385186005
may
cause|23981006|134198009
peri-anal ulcers|272114000|20928004
and
fissures.|134292000

Given|419582001
by injection|28289002|385218009|129326001
the drug|410942007
caused|23981006|134198009
fever|386661006
and
other local reactions.|74964007|255470001|263851003

Despite these difficulties,|371157007
a series|13039001
of 170 patients|116154003
were
reported|229059009|223458004
in 1916
by Ralph Hopkins,
the attending physician|405279007
at the Louisiana Leper Home|224063000|261770009
in Carville,
Louisiana.|224063000

He
divided|422033008
the patients|116154003
into two groups - 'incipient'|420797005|261586004|25721003|420797005|160481000|25721003
and
'advanced'.|86005002

In the advanced cases,|86005002|398241000|86005002|413769002
25%
(
at most|4757001
)
showed
any improvement
or
arrest|397829000|6155003
of their condition|260905004
;
in the incipient cases,|25721003|398241000|25721003|413769002
45%
reported|229059009|223458004
an improvement
or
stabilization|115979005
of the disease|64572001
(mortality rates|409651001
were
4%|260308009
and
8%,
respectively
).

The remainder
absconded|248046000
from the Home apparently|261770009
in improved condition.|385425000|260905004|3442003|260905004

Given|419582001
the apparent usefulness
of this agent,|260872001
a search
began|255395001
for improved formulations.|385425000|3442003

Victor Heiser
the Chief Quarantine Officer|170499009
and
Director
of Health|263775005
for Manila
and
Elidoro Mercado
the house physician|261770009|309343006|257630004|309343006
at the San Lazaro Hospital|285201006
for lepers
in Manila
decided
to
add
camphor|412108007
to a prescription|260885003
of chaulmoogra
and
resorcin,|411296008
which
was
typically
given|419582001
orally|260548002
at the suggestion
of Merck
and
Company
in Germany|223637004
to whom Heiser
had
written.|12261009

They
found|404684003
that
this new compound|7147002|62105006
was
readily
absorbed
without the nausea|422587007
that
had
plagued|58750007
the earlier preparations.|264499004|225106003

Heiser
and
Mercado
in 1913 then
administered|418283001
the oil|21847005|421890007
by injection|28289002|385218009|129326001
to two patients|420797005|116154003
who
were
cured
of the disease.|64572001

Since
this treatment|276239002|416118004
was
administered|418283001
in conjunction with other materials,|74964007|260769002
the results|394617004
were
not
clear.|263707001

A further two patients|46053002|420797005|116154003
were
treated|28995006
with the oil|21847005|421890007
by injection|28289002|385218009|129326001
without other treatments|74964007|276239002
and
again
appeared
to
be
cured
of the disease.|64572001

The following year,|255260001|258707000|255260001|259039008
Heiser
reported|229059009|223458004
a further 12 patients|46053002|116154003
but
the results|394617004
were
mixed.|26242008

Less toxic injectable forms|276139006|385218009|246176004|276139006|129326001|246176004|263796003|385218009|246176004|263796003|129326001|246176004
of this oil|21847005|421890007
were
then
sought.

Between 1920
and
1922,
a series|13039001
of papers|50833004
were
published
describing
the esters|45120003
of these oils.|21847005

These
may
have
been
based|418836005
on the work|261041009
of Alice Ball?|264780009
the record
is
not
clear|263707001
on this point
and
Ms Ball
died|419620001|419099009
in 1916.

Trials|110465008
of these esters|45120003
were
carried|288345009
out
in 1921
and
appeared
to
give|419582001
useful results.|394617004

These attempts
had
been
preceded|236874000
by others.|74964007

Merck
of Darmstadt
had
produced
a version|22303008
of the sodium salts|327714001
in 1891.

They
named|27468005
this sodium gynocardate|39972003
in the mistaken belief
that
the origin|255395001
of the oil|21847005|421890007
was
_Gynocardia odorata_.

Bayer
in 1908
marketed|284440009
a commercial version|22303008
of the esters|45120003
under the name 'Antileprol'.

To
ensure
a supply|425398004
of this agent Joseph Rock,|260872001
Professor
of Systematic Botany|246333005|31006001
at the College|224864007
of Hawaii,|224049006
traveled|420008001
to Burma.|223587000

The local villagers|255470001
located
a grove
of trees|22097005
in seed,|264337003
which
he
used to|394850002
establish|263748003
a plantation
of 2,980 trees|260306008|22097005
on the island|288560006
of Oahu,|224056000
Hawaii|224049006
between 1921
and
1922.

The oil|21847005|421890007
remained
a popular treatment|276239002|416118004
despite the common side effects|72906007
until the introduction|107733003
of sulfones|363549008
in the 1940s.

Debate
about its efficacy
continued|255238004
until
it
was
discontinued.|410546004

It
has
been
said|66049007
that Promin
was
first|255216001|232714002
synthesised
in 1940
by Feldman
of Parke-Davis
and
company.

Although
Parke-Davis
did
in fact
synthesise
the compound,|62105006
it
seems
certain|17162000
that
they
were
not
the first|255216001|232714002
;
in cooperation
with J.

Wittmann,
Emil Fromm synthesised
both
dapsone|387096002
and
some
of its derivatives,
including|55919000
promin,
in 1908.

He
was
however
a chemist|106256002
and
not
a medical worker,|74188005|106541005
nor
did
anyone
investigate|116698004
its medical value|74188005
until some decades afterwards.[70]

Until the introduction|107733003
of treatment|276239002|416118004
with promin
in the 1940s,
there
was
no effective treatment|255403003|276239002|255403003|416118004|254648000|276239002|254648000|416118004
for leprosy.|81004002

The efficacy
of promin
was
first|255216001|232714002
discovered
by Guy Henry Faget|223719008|304612009
and
his co-workers|106541005
in 1943
at Carville,
Louisiana.|224063000

In the 1950s dapsone|387096002
was
introduced|127487003
to Carville
by Dr.|309343006

R.G.|24028007|258795003

Cochrane.

It
is
only weakly bactericidal|50607009|409822003|50607009|420295001|409822003|420295001
against _[M.|258311008

leprae]
(/wiki/Mycobacterium_leprae|58242002
)
_
and
it
was
considered
necessary
for patients to|116154003
take|419652001
the drug indefinitely.|410942007

When
dapsone|387096002
was
used|394850002
alone,|105529008
the _M.|258311008

leprae_ population quickly|385436007|389109008
evolved|59381007
antibiotic resistance|255631004|30714006
;
by the 1960s,
the world's only known anti-leprosy drug|36692007|81004002|410942007
became
virtually useless.

The search
for more effective anti-leprosy drugs|242762006|255403003|81004002|410942007|242762006|254648000|81004002|410942007
led|88488004|236874000
to the use|277889008|419385000
of clofazimine|387410004
and
rifampicin|387159009
in the 1960s
and
1970s.

Later,
Indian scientist Shantaram Yawalkar|308027003
and
his colleagues
formulated
a combined therapy|22900004
using|260676000
rifampicin|387159009
and
dapsone,|387096002
intended|361269008
to
mitigate|6736007
bacterial resistance.|71219004

The first trials|255216001|110465008|232714002|110465008
of combined treatment|89780004|276239002|89780004|416118004
were
carried|288345009
out
in Malta|223670009
in the 1970s.

Multidrug therapy (MDT)|276239002
combining|89780004|20909006
all three drugs|421291004|410942007
was
first|255216001|232714002
recommended
by a
WHO Expert Committee
in 1981.

These three anti-leprosy drugs|421291004|81004002|410942007
are
still
used|394850002
in the standard MDT regimens.

None|260413007
of them
is
used alone|394850002|105529008
because of the risk|30207005
of developing resistance.|30714006

This treatment|276239002|416118004
was
quite expensive,
and
was
not quickly
adopted|160496001
in most endemic countries.|223369002

In 1985,
leprosy|81004002
was
still
considered
a public health problem|310115006|55607006
in 122 countries.|223369002

The 44th World Health Assembly (WHA),|263775005
held|421139008
in Geneva
in 1991,
passed
a resolution to
eliminate
leprosy|81004002
as a public-health problem|310115006|55607006
by the year 2000 ?|258707000|259039008
defined
as reducing|260400001
the global prevalence|60132005
of the disease|64572001
to less|276139006|263796003
than 1 case|260305007|398241000
per 10,000.

At the Assembly,
the World Health Organization (WHO)|263775005|21139007
was
given|419582001
the mandate to
develop
an elimination strategy|63911002
by its member states,|394852005|398070004
based|418836005
on increasing|260369004
the geographical coverage
of MDT
and
patients? accessibility|116154003
to the treatment.|276239002|416118004

Worldwide,
two|420797005
to three million people|421291004|125676002
are
estimated|414135002
to
be
permanently
disabled
because of leprosy.|81004002

India|223600005
has
the greatest number|4757001|410680006|4757001|410681005
of cases,|398241000|413769002
with Brazil|223715002
second|81170007|257997001|288495006
and
Myanmar third.|223587000|70905002

In 1999,
the world incidence
of Hansen's disease|81004002
was
estimated|414135002
to
be
640,000.

In 2000,
738,284 cases|398241000|413769002
were
identified.|7882003

In 2000,
the World Health Organization (WHO)|263775005|21139007
listed
91 countries|223369002
in which Hansen's disease|81004002
is
endemic.

India,|223600005
Burma,|223587000
and
Nepal|223602002
contained|42504009
70%
of cases.|398241000|413769002

India reports|223600005|229059009|223600005|223458004
over 50%
of the world's leprosy cases.|81004002|398241000|81004002|413769002

In 2002,
763,917 new cases|7147002|398241000|7147002|413769002
were
detected|260373001
worldwide,
and
in
that year|258707000|259039008
the WHO
listed
Brazil,|223715002
Madagascar,|223535004
Mozambique,|223542004
Tanzania,|223537007
and
Nepal|223602002
as
having
90%|264705001|264703008
of Hansen's disease cases.|81004002|398241000|81004002|413769002

According to recent figures|6493001
from the
WHO,
new cases|7147002|398241000|7147002|413769002
detected|260373001
worldwide
have
decreased|1250004|260400001|260371004
by approximately 107,000 cases|26175008|398241000|26175008|413769002
(
or
21%
)
from 2003
to 2004.

This decreasing trend|260371004|30294006
has
been
consistent|385433004
for the past three years.|410513005|421291004|258707000

In addition,|260364009
the global registered prevalence|60132005
of HD
was
286,063 cases|398241000|413769002
;
407,791 new cases|7147002|398241000|7147002|413769002
were
detected|260373001
during 2004.

In the United States,|223688001
the first definite reference|255216001|255545003|232714002|255545003
to the disease|64572001
was
in Florida|224048003
in 1758.

In 2004,
there
were
131 total cases|258755000|398241000|258755000|413769002|255619001|398241000|255619001|413769002
of the disease|64572001
in the United States.|223688001

Of the 131 cases,|398241000|413769002
two-thirds|420797005|70905002
were
found|404684003
to
be
males.|248153007

Also
out of the 131 cases,|398241000|413769002
25
were
of individuals|125676002|385435006
who
were
born|106970005|81827009|398209006
in the country,|223369002
which
amounts|107651007
to 19%.

,
Brazil|223715002
(9.2%

were
the next leading countries|18769003|236874000|223369002|255260001|236874000|223369002
where the victims
of the disease|64572001
were
originally
born.|106970005|81827009|398209006

A total|258755000|255619001
of 20 cases|398241000|413769002
were
found|404684003
to
be
white,|413773004|185984009|371251000
not
of Hispanic origin.|414408004|255395001

As of October,
2005,
3,604 patients|260313008|116154003
on the United States registry|223688001
were
currently|15240007
receiving
care.

The disease|64572001
is
tracked|257719005
by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|26216008|64572001|31509003|169443000
(CDC
)
,
with a total|258755000|255619001
of 166 new cases|7147002|398241000|7147002|413769002
reported|229059009|223458004
in the U.S.|223688001

in 2005.

Most|4757001
(100
or
60%
)
of these new cases|7147002|398241000|7147002|413769002
were
reported|229059009|223458004
in the following states|255260001|398070004
;
California,|224043007|25997004
Louisiana,|224063000
Massachusetts,|224066008
New York,|420278009
and
Texas.|421662006

Although
the number|410680006|410681005
of cases worldwide|398241000|413769002
continues|255238004
to
fall|1912002
,
pockets
of high prevalence|75540009|371879000
continue|255238004
in certain areas|17162000|42798000
such as Brazil,|223715002
South Asia|223500001
(India,|223600005
Nepal,|223602002
some parts|260726005
of Africa|223498002
(Tanzania,|223537007
Madagascar,|223535004
Mozambique,|223542004
and
the western Pacific.

Although
annual incidence ?|53281000
the number|410680006|410681005
of new leprosy cases|7147002|81004002|398241000|7147002|81004002|413769002
occurring|272120004
each year ?|258707000|259039008
is
important
as a measure|246445000|272391002
of transmission,|258150004
it
is
difficult to|52925006
measure|246445000|272391002
in leprosy|81004002
due to its long incubation period,|255511005|406646006
delays
in diagnosis|439401001
after onset|77374008
of the disease,|64572001
and
the lack|41277001
of laboratory tools to|261904005|86967005
detect|260373001
leprosy|81004002
in its very early stages.|260358002|264499004|261612004

Instead,
the registered prevalence
is
used.|394850002

Registered prevalence
is
a useful proxy indicator
of the disease burden,|64572001
as
it
reflects|225436004
the number|410680006|410681005
of active leprosy cases|55561003|81004002|398241000|55561003|81004002|413769002
diagnosed|439401001
with the disease|64572001
and
receiving treatment|276239002|416118004
with MDT
at a given point in time.|272105005

The prevalence rate
is
defined
as the number|410680006|410681005
of cases|398241000|413769002
registered|229053005
for MDT treatment|276239002|416118004
among the population|385436007|389109008
in which
the cases|398241000|413769002
have
occurred|272120004
,
again
at a given point in time.[77]|272105005

New case detection|7147002|398241000
is
another indicator
of the disease|64572001
that
is
usually
reported|229059009|223458004
by countries|223369002
on an annual basis.|53281000|53281000|418836005

It
includes|55919000
cases|398241000|413769002
diagnosed|439401001
with onset|77374008
of disease|64572001
in the year|258707000|259039008
in question|42425007
(true incidence|31874001
)
and
a large proportion|255509001|8212001
of cases|398241000|413769002
with onset|77374008
in previous years|9130008|258707000
(
termed
a backlog prevalence
of undetected cases|398241000|413769002
).

Endemic countries also|223369002
report|229059009|223458004
the number|410680006|410681005
of new cases|7147002|398241000|7147002|413769002
with established disabilities|263748003|21134002|385645004|21134002
at the time|410669006
of detection,
as
an indicator
of the backlog prevalence.

Determination
of the time|410669006
of onset|77374008
of the disease|64572001
is
,
in general, unreliable,|60132005
is
very|260358002
labor-|289909005|261041009
intensive,
and
is
seldom|103356009
done
in recording
these statistics.

As
reported|229059009|223458004
to WHO
by 115 countries|223369002
and
territories|398070004
in 2006,
and
published
in the Weekly Epidemiological Record,|14497002
the global registered prevalence|60132005
of leprosy|81004002
at the beginning|255395001
of the year|258707000|259039008
was
219,826 cases.|398241000|413769002

New-case detection|7147002|398241000
during the previous year|9130008|258707000|9130008|259039008
(2005 -
the last year|258707000|259039008
for which full country information|261015003|223369002
is
available|103328004
)
was
296,499.

The reason|410666004
for the annual detections|53281000
being
higher|75540009|371879000
than the prevalence
at the end|261782000|422117008
of the year|258707000|259039008
can
be
explained
by the fact
that
a proportion|8212001
of new cases|7147002|398241000|7147002|413769002
complete|255594003
their treatment|276239002|416118004
within the year|258707000|259039008
and
,
therefore,
no longer|255511005
remain
on the registers.|229053005

The global detection|60132005
of new cases|7147002|398241000|7147002|413769002
continues|255238004
to
show
a sharp decline,|410707003
falling|1912002
by 110,000 cases|398241000|413769002
(27%
)
during 2005
compared
with the previous year.|9130008|258707000|9130008|259039008

Table 1|86407004
shows
that global annual detection|60132005|53281000
has
been
declining
since 2001.

The African region|413464008|410673009
reported|229059009|223458004
an 8.7% decline
in the number|410680006|410681005
of new cases|7147002|398241000|7147002|413769002
compared
with 2004.

The comparable figure
for the Americas
was
20.1%,
for South-East Asia 32%,|223585008
and
for the Eastern Mediterranean 7.6%.

The Western Pacific area,|42798000
however,
showed
a 14.8% increase|260366006
during the same period.|262126009|259037005

Table 2|86407004
shows
the leprosy situation|81004002
in the four major countries|421534005|255603008|223369002
that
have
yet to
achieve
the goal|410518001
of elimination|63911002

discovered
in a tomb next to|18769003
the Old City|70753007|284560003
of Jerusalem
shows
him to
be
the earliest human|264499004|278412004
proven to|277025001
have
suffered
from leprosy.|81004002

The remains
were
dated|410671006
by radiocarbon methods|260686004|272394005
to 1-50 A.D.[79]|260305007

After the end|261782000|422117008
of the 17th century,
Norway,|223673006
Iceland|223667005
and
England|223664003
were
the countries|223369002
in Western Europe|223658005
where leprosy|81004002
was
a significant problem.|386134007|55607006

During the 1830s,
the number|410680006|410681005
of lepers
in Norway,|223673006
Iceland|223667005
and
England|223664003
rose
rapidly,|418694008
believed
to
be
caused|23981006|134198009
by frequent visits|70232002
of sailors
who
visited
Western India,|223600005
causing|23981006
an increase|260366006
in medical research|74188005
into the condition,|260905004
and
the disease|64572001
became
a political issue.|55607006

Norway|223673006
appointed
a medical superintendent|74188005
for leprosy|81004002
in 1854
and
established|263748003|385645004
a national register|229053005
for lepers
in 1856,
the first national patient register|255216001|307927003|232714002|307927003
in the world.[80]

_Mycobacterium leprae_,|58242002
the causative agent|362944004
of leprosy,|81004002
was
discovered
by [G.|258795003

H.|89177007|258322007|286551008

Armauer Hansen]
(/wiki/Gerhard_Armauer_Hansen
)
in Norway|223673006
in 1873,
making
it the first bacterium to|255216001|409822003|232714002|409822003
be
identified|7882003
as causing disease|23981006|64572001
in humans.|278412004

The principal opposition|63161005|247919005|302311007|247919005
to Hansen's
view|246516004
that leprosy|81004002
was
an infectious disease|191415002
came
from his father-|66839005
in-law,
Daniel Cornelius Danielssen
who
considered
it a hereditary disease|32895009
and
had
stated|398070004
this
in his book,|278212002
??Trait?
de la Spedalskhed ou Elephantiasis des Grecs??|396026002|230782004
-
the standard reference book|278212002
on leprosy|81004002
from 1848
until the death|419620001|268923008
of Danielssen
in 1895.

While
Danielssen's book|278212002
in 1847
was
a highly used source|75540009|394850002|260753009
and
provided
a solid foundation|35702001|35702001|418836005|78910004|78910004|418836005|421378002|421378002|418836005
for worldwide leprosy understanding,|81004002|66216009
it
was
soon
surpassed.

In 1867 Dr.|309343006

Gavin Milroy
finished|420604000
the Royal College of Physicians' Report|224864007|309343006|229059009|224864007|309343006|223458004
on leprosy.|81004002

His work,|261041009
which
compiled
data
from all corners
of the English empire,|297487008|25804004
agreed
with Danielssen
that leprosy|81004002
was
a hereditary disease,|32895009
but
went
further to|46053002
state|398070004
that leprosy|81004002
was
also
a constitutional disease|64572001
that
could
be
mitigated|6736007
by improvements
in one's health,|421379005|263775005
diet,|41829006
and
living conditions.|4683004

[84]

Hansen
observed
a number|410680006|410681005
of nonrefractile small rods|255507004|17139002
in unstained tissue sections.|430856003

The rods|17139002
were
not soluble
in potassium lye,|88480006|311721007
and
they
were
acid-|34957004
and
alcohol-fast.|419442005|16985007|419442005|277748003|53041004|16985007|53041004|277748003|430837008|16985007|430837008|277748003

In 1879,
he
was
able to|371150009
stain|397165007|127790008
these organisms|410653004
with Ziehl's method|260686004|272394005
and
the similarities
with Koch's bacillus|113861009
(_Mycobacterium tuberculosis_|113861009
)
were
noted.

There
were
three significant differences|421291004|386134007|263735002
between these organisms|410653004
:
(1
)
the rods|17139002
in the leprosy lesions|81004002
were
extremely numerous,|260396001
(2
)
they
formed|35810008
characteristic intracellular collections|83167003
(_globii_
)
,
and
(3
)
the rods|17139002
had
a variety
of shapes|107644003
with branching|77796000
and
swelling.|423666004|442672001

These differences|263735002
suggested
that leprosy|81004002
was
caused|23981006|134198009
by an organism|410653004
related|272151006|262094002
to
but
distinct
from _Mycobacterium tuberculosis_.|113861009

He
worked|261041009
at _St.

J?rgens Hospital_|285201006
in Bergen,
founded
early|264499004
in the fifteenth century.

St.

J?rgens
is
now
preserved|277405005
as a museum,|264370008
_Lepramuseet_.[85]

When
the fear|1402001
of leprosy|81004002
was
rampant
in societies
across Europe|223502009
and
Asia there|223500001
was
also
an associated rise|47429007
in crime levels|258395000
and
overall dissatisfaction
amongst the population.|385436007|389109008

The leprosariums
created
during these times|410669006|417929005
had
multiple benefits|260396001
:
first,|255216001|232714002
they
provided
treatment|276239002|416118004
and
safe living quarters|74397004
for all
lepers
that
were
admitted|32485007
;
secondly,|81170007
they
eased
tension|53489000
amongst the healthy townspeople|263775005
;
and
thirdly,|70905002
they
provided
for a more stable populace|242762006|58158008
for the authorities
to govern.[86][87]

The word _leprosy_|255373000|81004002
comes
from ancient Greek _?????_ [l?pr?],|1451003
"
a disease|64572001
that
makes
the skin scaly",|271761007
in turn,|282987006
a nominal derivation
of the verb _????_ [l?p?],|255373000
"
to peel,|257890000|51979000
scale|19892000|278111002
off".

_?????_
(Lepos
)
in ancient Greek means peel,|1451003|255586005|257890000|1451003|255586005|51979000
or
scale,|19892000|278111002
so|223528007
from _?????_
we
have
_???????_
(_???????_
=
who
has
peels - scales|257890000|19892000|257890000|13389002|51979000|19892000|51979000|13389002
)
-
-
>
and
then _??????_
(
=leprous|81004002
).

The word|255373000
came
into the English language|297487008
via Latin
and
old French.|70753007|19434008

The
first
attested English use|297487008|277889008|297487008|419385000|25804004|277889008|25804004|419385000
is
in the _Ancrene Wisse,
_
a 13th-century
manual|87982008
for nuns
("Moyseses hond..bisemde o ?e spitel uuel & ?uhte lepruse." _
The Middle English Dictionary,|255562008|297487008|255562008|25804004|399488007|297487008|399488007|25804004
_ s.|288495006
v.
,
"leprous"|81004002
).

A roughly contemporaneous use|277889008|419385000
is
attested
in the Anglo-Norman _Dialogues
of Saint Gregory,
_ "Esmondez i sont li lieprous"|42146005|85899009|22971001|85899009
(_Anglo-Norman Dictionary,
_ s.|288495006
v.
,
"leprus"
).

Throughout history,|392521001
individuals|125676002|385435006
with Hansen's disease|81004002
have
been
known|36692007
as
_lepers_
;
however,
this term
is
falling|1912002
into disuse
as a result|394617004
of the diminishing number|1250004|410680006|1250004|410681005
of leprosy patients.|81004002|116154003

Because of the stigma|9097005
to patients,|116154003
some prefer|225773000
not to
use|277889008|419385000
the word "leprosy,|255373000|81004002
"
though
the term
is
used|394850002
by the U.S.|223688001

Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|26216008|64572001|31509003|169443000
and
the World Health Organization.|263775005|21139007

Historically,
the term _Tzaraath_
from the Hebrew Bible
was
,
erroneously,
commonly
translated
as leprosy,|81004002
although
the symptoms
of Tzaraath
were
not entirely consistent|385433004
with leprosy|81004002
and
,
rather,
referred|439980006
to a variety
of disorders|64572001
other than Hansen's disease.|81004002

The first mention|255216001|232714002
of leprosy|81004002
recorded
is
found|404684003
in Leviticus 13
:
2 - "|260306008
When
a man|248153007|339947000|278412004
shall
have
in the skin|119325001|39937001|181469002
of his flesh
a rising,
a scab,|69640009
or
bright spot,|221668007|23840004
and
it
be
in the skin|119325001|39937001|181469002
of his flesh
like the plague|58750007
of leprosy|81004002
;
then
he
shall
be
brought|68369002
unto Aaron
the priest,|79918004
or
unto one|421379005
of his sons|65616008
the priests."|79918004
There
is
also
the well-known Bible story|20572008|36692007
of the Syrian Naaman,|392389001|59487007
"
captain
of the host
of the king
of Syria"|223617003
(2 Kings 5|264655001
:

)
,
who
suffered
from this severe|24484000
and
savage skin disease.|95320005

In particular, tinea capitis|5441008
(fungal scalp infection|3218000|41695006|3218000|181480002|414561005|200727009
)
and
related infections|272151006|262094002
on other body parts|74964007|38866009
caused|23981006|134198009
by the dermatophyte fungus _Trichophyton violaceum_|416959009|414561005|67490006
are
abundant
throughout the Middle East|223605000
and
North Africa today|223498002
and
might
also
have
been
common|72906007
in biblical times.|410669006|417929005

Likewise,
the related agent|272151006|260872001|262094002|260872001
of the disfiguring skin disease favus _Trichophyton schoenleinii_|95320005|85375000|56075008
appears
to
have
been
common|72906007
throughout Eurasia
and
Africa|223498002
before
the advent
of modern medicine.|410942007

Persons|125676002
with severe favus|24484000|85375000
and
similar fungal diseases|3218000
(
and
potentially also
with severe psoriasis|24484000|9014002

other diseases|74964007|64572001
not
caused|23981006|134198009
by microorganisms|264395009

tended
to
be
classed|258391009
as
having
leprosy|81004002
as late|260383002
as the 17th century
in Europe.|223502009

This
is
clearly
shown
in the painting _|36864000

In the West,
the earliest known description|264499004|36692007
of leprosy there|81004002
was
made
by the Roman encyclopedist Aulus Cornelius Celsus|223655008
(25 BCE ? 37 CE
)
in his _
De Medicina_
;
he
called leprosy "_elephantiasis_".|81004002

The Roman author Pliny|223655008|308004006
the Elder|15737008|422164008
(23?79 CE|264657009
)
mentioned
the same disease.|262126009|64572001

Although
"_sara't_"
of Leviticus
(Old Testament|70753007
is
translated
as "_lepra_"
in the 5th century CE Vulgate,|32088001
the original term _sara't_|19535007
found|404684003
in Leviticus
was
not
the _elephantiasis_
described
by Celsus
and
Pliny
;
in fact,
_sara't_
was
used|394850002
to
describe
a disease|64572001
that
could
affect|4065008
houses|261770009
and
clothing.|272180002

Katrina C.

D.

McLeod
and
Robin D.|88179001

S.

Yates
state|398070004
that _sara't_ "
denotes
a condition|260905004
of ritual impurity|67431008|262108006
or
a temporary form|14803004|246176004
of skin disease."[91]|95320005

The Persian polymath Avicenna
(c.

980?1037
)
was
the first|255216001|232714002
outside of China to|223581004
describe
the destruction|64597002
of the nasal septum|68426009|181197004
in those suffering
from leprosy.[91]|81004002

Numerous _leprosaria_,|260396001
or
leper hospitals,
sprang
up
in the Middle Ages|28288005
;
Matthew Paris,|7074004
a Benedictine Monk,
estimated|414135002
that
in the early thirteenth century there|264499004
were
19,000
across Europe.|223502009

The first recorded Leper colony|255216001|258736000|232714002|258736000
was
in Harbledown,
England.|223664003

These institutions|385437003
were
run|418060005|282476009
along monastic lines|50009006
and
,
while
lepers
were
encouraged
to
live|419749002
in these monastic-type establishments,|261664005
this
was
for their own health|263775005
as well as
quarantine.|170499009

Indeed,
some medieval sources|260753009
indicate|410535002
belief
that
those suffering
from leprosy|81004002
were
considered
to
be
going
through Purgatory
on Earth,
and
for this reason|410666004
their suffering
was
considered
holier
than the ordinary person's.|125676002

More frequently,|242762006|70232002
lepers
were
seen
to
exist
in a place|257557008|421066005
between life and death|224130005|419620001|224130005|268923008
:
They
were
still alive, yet many chose|438949009
or
were
forced|263760002
to ritually
separate|263869007
themselves
from mundane existence.

The Order
of Saint Lazarus
was
a hospitaller
and
military order|302314004
of monks
that
began|255395001
as a leper hospital|285201006
outside Jerusalem
in the twelfth century|46213005
and
remained
associated|47429007
with leprosy|81004002
throughout its history.|392521001

The first monks|255216001|232714002
in this order
were
leper knights,
and
they originally
had
leper grand masters,|261666007
although
these aspects
of the order
changed|243326001|263703002
over the centuries.

Radegund
was
noted
for washing
the feet|56459004|259051005
of lepers.

Orderic Vitalis writes|12261009
of a monk,
Ralf,
who
was
so|223528007
overcome
by the plight
of lepers
that
he
prayed|130886008
to
catch|30623001
leprosy|81004002
himself
(
which he eventually
did
).

The leper
would
carry|288345009
a clapper
and
bell to
warn
of his approach,
and
this
was
as
much to|242762006|4757001
attract
attention|6769007
for charity
as to warn people|125676002
that
a diseased person|64572001|125676002
was
near.|277752003

_
The Oxford
Illustrated
Companion|62071000|262043009
to Medicine_|410942007
holds|421139008
that
the mention
of leprosy,|81004002
as well as
cures
for it,
were
already
described
in the Hindu religious book _Atharva-veda_.|61154002|62458008|278212002|160545000|62458008|278212002

Writing|12261009
in the _Encyclop?dia Britannica 2008_,|128787000
Kearns & Nash
state|398070004
that
the first mention|255216001|232714002
of leprosy|81004002
is
in the Indian medical treatise _Sushruta Samhita_|74188005
(6th century BC
).

_
The Cambridge Encyclopedia
of Human Paleopathology_|278412004
(1998
)
holds|421139008
that
:
"
The _Sushruta Samhita_
from India|223600005
describes
the condition quite well|260905004|20572008
and
even
offers|410527000
therapeutic suggestions|262202000
as early|264499004
as
about 600 BC"[96]
The surgeon Sushruta|304292004
lived|224130005|419749002
in the Indian city|284560003
of Kashi
by the 6th century BC,
[97]|260309001|264708004
and
the medical treatise _Sushruta Samhita_ ?|74188005
attributed|246061005
to him ?
made
its appearance|386548000|255412001
during the 1st millennium BC.|255216001

The earliest surviving excavated written material|264499004|12261009|260769002
that
contains|42504009
the works|261041009
of Sushruta
is
the _Bower Manuscript_?
dated|410671006
to the 4th century AD,|29970001
almost a millennium
after the original work.|19535007|261041009

Despite the existence
of these earlier|264499004
works|261041009
the first generally|255216001|232714002
considered
accurate description|263656005
of the disease|64572001
was
that
of Galen|34385009
of Pergamum
in 150 AD_[citation
needed|410525008|103325001

In 2009,
a 4,000-year-old skeleton|260308009|258707000|70753007|113192009|260308009|258707000|70753007|361378004|260308009|259039008|70753007|113192009|260308009|259039008|70753007|361378004
was
uncovered|255368006
in India|223600005
that
was
shown
to
contain|42504009
traces|260405006
of leprosy.|81004002

The discovery
was
made
at a site|10546003
called
Balathal,
which
is
today part|260726005
of Rajasthan,
and
is
believed to
be
the oldest case|70753007|398241000
of the disease ever|64572001
found.|404684003

This
pre-dated|236874000|410671006|272113006|410671006
the previous earliest recognized case,|9130008|264499004|398241000
dating|410671006
back
to 6th-century Egypt,|223511009
by 1,500 years.|260305007|258707000

It
is
believed
that
the excavated skeleton|113192009|361378004
belonged
to a male,|248153007
who
was
in his late 30s|260383002
and
belonged
to the Ahar Chalcolithic culture.|252398009|61594008

Archaeologists|158929005
have
stated|398070004
that
not only
does
the skeleton|113192009|361378004
represent
the oldest case|70753007|398241000
of leprosy ever|81004002
found|404684003
,
but
is
also
the first|255216001|232714002
such example
that
dates|410671006
back
to prehistoric India.|223600005

This finding|404684003
supports|9096001|243114000
one|421379005
of the theories
regarding
the origin|255395001
of the disease,|64572001
which
is
believed to
have
originated
in
either
India|223600005
or
Africa,|223498002
before
being
subsequently
spread|410677005
to Europe|223502009
by the armies
of Alexander
the Great.[100]|255509001|263768009

In 1874,
the Missions
to Lepers
Act
was
brought|68369002
about
as a means to|255586005
treat|395077000
leprosy|81004002
by segregating males|248153007
and
females|248152002
in the institutions.|385437003

The asylum superintendents
believe
that
this separation|16640008|160788005
was
beneficial
because
no children|410601007|160499008
were
to
be
born|106970005|81827009|398209006
into families|35359004
of diseased parents,|64572001|40683002
the
act
of which
was
considered
a sin.

Leprosy|81004002
at this time|410669006
was
still
believed to
be
hereditarily
transmitted|60117003|258150004
from parents|40683002
to offspring|160499008
though
the bacteria causing leprosy|409822003|23981006|81004002
was
discovered
by Dr.|309343006

Gerhard Armauer Hansen just one year|421379005|258707000|421379005|259039008
before
[105]

In 1881,
around 120,000 leprosy patients|81004002|116154003
existed
in India.|223600005

The central government|26216008
passed
the Lepers
Act
of 1898,
which
provided
legal provision|398165009
for forcible confinement|285653008
of leprosy sufferers|81004002
in India.[106]|223600005

but
also
the "swelling|423666004|442672001

Across Indonesia|223589002
the rate
of prevalence
is
slightly|425404009
under one new case|421379005|7147002|398241000
per 10,000 people,|125676002

and
treatment|276239002|416118004
of their disease,|64572001
largely
due to lack|41277001
of awareness|312012004
and
to a pervasive stigma|85333001|9097005

PERMATA
(Perhimpunan Mandiri Kusta
)
Indonesia|223589002
was
established|263748003|385645004
in 2007
with the specific vision|69658003|281004000
of fighting|248005005
the stigma|9097005
associated|47429007
with leprosy|81004002
and
eliminating
the discrimination|311718005
against those identified|7882003
as suffering
from the disease.|64572001

The organization|21139007
was
founded
by a small group|255507004|261586004|255507004|160481000|255507004|389109008
of individuals|125676002|385435006
who
had
all personally
been
treated|28995006
for leprosy.|81004002

The founders|44066000
worked|261041009
to
establish|263748003
links
with key figures
amongst those suffering
from the disease|64572001
in communities|133928008
in South Sulawesi,|223749005
East Java|223744000
and
NTT,
the three provinces|421291004
where the rate
of incidence
of the disease|64572001
is
probably
amongst the highest|75540009|371879000
in Indonesia.[108]|223589002

Japan|223583001
has
had
a unique history|392521001
of segregation
of patients|116154003
into sanatoriums
based|418836005
on leprosy prevention laws|81004002|169443000
of 1907,
1931,
and
1953,
and
,
hence,
it
intensified leprosy stigma.|81004002|9097005

The 1953 law
was
abrogated
in 1996.

There
were
still 2717 ex-patients|116154003
in 13 national sanatoriums
and
2 private hospitals|260306008|309895006
as of 2008.

In a document|397966007
written|12261009
in 833,
leprosy|81004002
was
described
as "
caused|23981006|134198009
by a parasite|37763007
that eats five organs|48263008|421820001|410653004
of the body.|279495008|123037004

The eyebrows|392262008
and
eyelashes|85803001
come
off,
and
the nose|260540009|181195007
is
deformed.

The disease brings|64572001|68369002
hoarseness|50219008
,
and
necessitates
amputations|81723002
of the fingers|7569003|259052003
and
toes.|29707007

Do
not
sleep|258158006
with the patients,|116154003
as
the disease|64572001
is
transmittable
to those nearby."
This
was
the first document concerning infectivity.|255216001|397966007|255216001|232714002|397966007|232714002

Males|248153007
admitted|32485007
to leprosariums
in Japan|223583001
were
sterilized
and
females|248152002
found|404684003
to
be
pregnant|77386006|127362006
were
forced|263760002
to
have
abortions.|70317007|386639001

These extreme actions|12565001|129264002
were
done
to
prevent
children|410601007|160499008
of diseased parents|64572001|40683002
from
being
born|106970005|81827009|398209006
lest
they also
contract|78558002
the disease.|64572001

Doctors|309343006
during this time still mistakenly|410669006
believed
that leprosy|81004002
was
a hereditary disease.|32895009

Lepers
were
seen
as
being
incurable
and
infectious,
the main reason|63161005|410666004
they
were
forced|263760002
into exile.

Leprosy patients|81004002|116154003
in India,|223600005
like many parts|260726005
of the world,
suffer
under some
of the worst conditions|556001|260905004|367391008|260905004|230993007|260905004|390772001|260905004|231877006|260905004
and
stereotypes|5507002
about their disease.|64572001

Depending
on the level|258395000|276625007
of disfigurement
a leper
could
receive
harsher stigma|76412005|9097005
and
ostracism.

Leprosy sufferers|81004002
are
markedly|46998006
disadvantaged
with respect
to income
with 16-44%
of victims
reporting|223458004
a decrease|260400001|260370003
in pay
as a result|394617004
of
having
leprosy.|81004002

Women|224526002
suffer
greater restrictions|263768009|263856008
and
social stigma|9097005
than men.|339947000

Leprosy|81004002
prevents|116699007
mothers|72705000
from getting too
close|29179001
to their children|410601007|160499008
out of
fear|1402001
that
they
could
infect
them.

In a report,|229059009|223458004
49%
of women|224526002
stopped|385654001
breast-feeding|169741004
their babies|418119000
as a result|394617004
of
having
leprosy.|81004002

Doctors|309343006
and
other health care providers|74964007
and
NGOs
are
working|261041009
hard to|72505002
educate|409073007
people|125676002
about the disease.|64572001

In one study|421379005|110465008|421379005|224699009
when
leprosy treatment|81004002|276239002|81004002|416118004
and
education|266981003|409073007
were
mixed|26242008
in
with the local healthcare program|255470001
the attitudes|225464009
towards the disease|64572001
were
somewhat
alleviated
as people|125676002
had
a better understanding|3442003|66216009
of it.

Now
the disease prevalence|64572001
has
been
reduced|260400001
to less
than 1|260305007
per million population|385436007|389109008
in most parts|260726005
of the country.[111]|223369002
