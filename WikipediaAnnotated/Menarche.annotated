Girls|431549007
experience
menarche|20016009
at different ages.|263735002|424144002

The timing|246512002
of menarche|20016009
is
influenced
by female biology,|248152002|12893009|224526002|12893009
as well as
genetic|3950001|255395001
and
environmental factors,|102487004
especially nutritional factors.

The average age|424144002
of menarche|20016009
has
declined
over the last century
but
the magnitude|246173007|272100000
of the decline
and
the factors
responsible|394851003
remain
subjects
of contention.

The worldwide average age|424144002
of menarche|20016009
is
very difficult to|260358002|52925006
estimate|414135002
accurately,
and
it
varies
significantly
by geographical region,|410673009
race,|415229000
ethnicity|397731000
and
other characteristics.|74964007

Various estimates|256220008|414135002
have
placed|257557008|421066005
it
at 13.

Some estimates|414135002
suggest
that
the _median_ age|399488007|424144002|260528009|424144002
of menarche worldwide|20016009
is
14,
and
that there
is
a later age|260383002|424144002
of onset|77374008
in Asian populations|414978006|385436007
compared
to the West.

The average age|424144002
of menarche|20016009
is
about 12.5 years|258707000
in the United States,|223688001
[4] 12.72|260308009
in Canada,|223686002
[5] 12.9|264706000|264605009
in the UK[6]
and
13.06 ? 0.10 years|258707000
in Iceland.|223667005

A study|110465008|224699009
on girls|431549007
in Istanbul,
Turkey,|278900006|20657003
found|404684003
the median age|399488007|424144002|260528009|424144002
at menarche to|20016009
be
12.74 years.[8]|258707000

Menarche|20016009
is
the culmination
of a series|13039001
of physiological|1360005
and
anatomic processes|36298004|415178003
of puberty|18991001
:

No specific hormonal signal|69658003|278994005
for menarche|20016009
is
known|36692007
;
menarche|20016009
as a discrete event|272379006
is
thought to|88952004
be
the relatively chance result|394617004
of the gradual thickening|255343009|263899003
of the endometrium|2739003|278867007
induced|16404004
by rising
but
fluctuating pubertal estrogen.|255341006|419960003|61946003

The _menstruum_,|248957007
or
_flow,
_
consists
of a combination|89780004
of fresh|261013005
and
clotted blood|75753009
with endometrial tissue.|2739003|85756007|278867007|85756007

The initial flow|884001|232714002
of menarche|20016009
is
usually brighter|221668007
than mature menstrual flow.|34071009|248957007

It
is
often|70232002
scanty|263865001
in amount|107651007
and
may
be
very brief, even|260358002|359530003|260358002|359535008
a single instance|125681006|50607009
of "spotting."|64996003|9126005
Like other menses,|74964007|248957007|74964007|282027006
menarche|20016009
may
be
accompanied
by abdominal cramping.

In most girls,|431549007
menarche|20016009
does
not
signal|38952000
that ovulation|34008004
has
occurred.|272120004

In postmenarchal girls,|431549007
about 80%
of the cycles|44180009
were
anovulatory|251663001
in the first year|255216001|258707000|255216001|259039008|232714002|258707000|232714002|259039008
after menarche,|20016009
50%
in the third|70905002
and
10%
in the sixth year.|53046009|258707000|53046009|259039008

Regular ovulation|17854005|34008004
is
usually
indicated|410535002
by predictable
and
consistent intervals|385433004|385673002
between menses,|248957007|282027006
predictable
and
consistent durations|385433004|103335007
of menses,|248957007|282027006
and
predictable
and
consistent patterns|385433004|272135003
of flow
(
e.g.
,
heaviness
or
cramping|55300003|410709000
).

Continuing ovulation typically|255238004|34008004
requires
a body fat content|248300009|276824008
of
at least 22%.|276139006|263796003

An anthropological term
for this state|398070004
of potential fertility|30207005|397594008|30207005|8619003|30207005|87727006
is
nubility.

On the other hand,|74964007|85562004|74964007|302539009
not
every girl|431549007
follows|367409002
the typical pattern,|272135003
and
some girls|431549007
ovulate|34008004
before the first menstruation.|255216001|248957007|232714002|248957007

Although
unlikely,
it
is
possible|371930009|60022001
for a girl|431549007
who
has
engaged|54986009
in sexual intercourse shortly|258139002
before her menarche to|20016009
conceive
and
become
pregnant,|77386006|127362006
which
would
delay
her menarche|20016009
until
after
the delivery._[citation|236973005|118215003
needed|410525008|103325001
_]
This goes
against the widely held assumption|421139008
that
a woman|224526002
cannot
become
pregnant|77386006|127362006
until
after
menarche.|20016009

When
menarche|20016009
occurs|272120004
,
it
confirms|59156000
that
the girl|431549007
has
had
a gradual estrogen-induced growth|255343009|61946003|16404004
of the uterus,|35039007|181452004
especially
the endometrium,|2739003|278867007
and
that
the "outflow tract"
from the uterus,|35039007|181452004
through the cervix|71252005
to the vagina,|76784001|181441005
is
open.|56116003

In very rare instances,|260358002|84638005|260358002|103356009
menarche|20016009
may
occur|272120004
at an unusually early age,|264499004|424144002
preceding|236874000
thelarche|118186000
and
other signs|74964007|72670004
of puberty.|18991001

This
is
termed _
*
*isolated premature menarche|46651001|44062003
*
*_,
but
other causes|74964007|134198009
of bleeding|131148009
must
be
investigated|116698004
and
excluded.|77765009

Growth
is
usually normal.|17621005|258744000

Isolated premature menarche|46651001|44062003
is
rarely|103356009
the first manifestation|255216001|250255003|255216001|251190009|232714002|250255003|232714002|251190009
of precocious puberty.|400179000

When
menarche|20016009
has
failed
to
occur|272120004
for more
than 3 years|260313008|258707000
after thelarche,|118186000
or
beyond 16 years|258707000
of age,|424144002
the delay
is
referred to|439980006
as
primary amenorrhea.|8913004

Some
of the least understood environmental influences|276139006|66216009|276339004|263796003|66216009|276339004
on timing|246512002
of puberty|18991001
are
social
and
psychological.|60224009

Nearly
all
of the research
on these effects|253861007
has
concerned girls,|431549007
partly
because
female puberty|248152002|18991001|224526002|18991001
requires
greater physiological resources|263768009|1360005
and
partly
because
it
involves|248448006
a unique event|272379006
(menarche|20016009
)
that
makes
survey research
into female puberty|248152002|18991001|224526002|18991001
much simpler|242762006|13673007|4757001|13673007
than male.|248153007

In most
of these studies|110465008|224699009
menarche|20016009
was
specifically
examined|64049009
,
assuming
it to
be
a valid "proxy"
for the more general process|242762006|60132005|415178003
of puberty.|18991001

In comparison
with the effects|253861007
of genetics,
nutrition,|87276001|384759009
and
general health,|105724001
social influences
are
small,|255507004
shifting|9546005
timing|246512002
by a few months|57176003|258706009
rather than
years.|258707000

The most important part|4757001|260726005
of a child's psychosocial environment|410601007|276339004|160499008|276339004
is
the family.|35359004

Some
of the aspects
of family structure|35359004
and
function|246464006
reported|229059009|223458004
to
be
independently
associated|47429007
with earlier menarche|44062003

with later menarche|83017007
:

Other research|74964007
has
focused|87017008|363702006
on the effect|253861007
of childhood stress|68433009|262188008
on timing|246512002
of puberty,|18991001
especially female.|248152002|224526002

Stress|262188008
is
a vague term|25615006
and
studies|110465008|224699009
have
examined conditions|64049009|260905004
ranging
from family tensions|105485001
or
conflict|15863006
to wartime refugee status|446654005|263490005
with threat
to physical survival.|5880005|19388002

The more|242762006
dire
social conditions
have
been
found|404684003
to
be
associated|47429007
with delay
of maturation,
an effect|253861007
that
may
be
compounded|62105006
by dietary inadequacy.|41829006|71978007

There
is
more uncertainty|242762006|64957009
and
mixed evidence|26242008|18669006
as to
whether milder degrees|255604002|246173007
of stress|262188008
or
early-life undernutrition|264499004|224130005|248325000
can
accelerate|14355007
puberty|18991001
in girls|431549007
as
would
be
predicted
by life history theory|224130005|224130005|392521001
and
demonstrated
in many other mammals.|74964007|387976007

The understanding|66216009
of these environmental effects|276339004|253861007
is
incomplete|255599008|255609007
and
the following observations|255260001|103705002
and
cautions
are
relevant
:

There
were
few systematic studies|57176003|246333005|110465008|57176003|246333005|224699009
of timing|246512002
of menarche|20016009
before the later half|260383002
of the 20th century.

Most older estimates|70753007|414135002
of average timing|246512002
of menarche|20016009
were
based|418836005
on observation|103705002
of a small homogeneous population|255507004|385436007|255507004|389109008
not necessarily representative
of the larger population,|255509001|385436007|255509001|389109008|263768009|385436007|263768009|389109008
or
based|418836005
on recall
by adult women,|133936004|224526002
which
is
also susceptible|131196009
to various forms|256220008|246176004
of error.

Most sources|260753009
agree
that
the average age|424144002
of menarche|20016009
in girls|431549007
in modern societies
has
declined
,
though
the reasons|410666004
and
the degree|258395000|246173007
remain
subjects
of controversy.

A decline
in the average age|424144002
of menarche|20016009
from 17
to 13
in Europe|223502009
from 1850
to 1960
is
well documented,[15]|20572008|397934002
but
a large North American survey|255509001|160516002
reported|229059009|223458004
only
a 2-3 month decline|260306008|258706009|260306008|259036001
from the mid-1970s|255562008
to the mid-1990s.|255562008

A 2011 study|110465008|224699009
found|404684003
that
each 1 kg/m2 increase|260305007|223574006|278077005|260366006|260305007|258683005|278077005|260366006
in childhood body-mass index (BMI)|68433009|60621009
can
be
expected
to
result|394617004
in a 6.5% higher absolute risk|260271001|15508007|56136002
of early menarche|44062003
(
before age 12 years|424144002|258707000
).

The decline
is
commonly
attributed|246061005
to larger body size|255509001|279495008|277049003|255509001|123037004|277049003|263768009|279495008|277049003|263768009|123037004|277049003
and
earlier average attainment|264499004
of sufficient body fat,|51117008|248300009
but
other factors|74964007
such as environmental exposure|276339004|71677004|276339004|24932003
to chemicals|441900009
that
mimic
estrogen|61946003
or
the urbanization
and
sexualization
of Western society
have
also
been
considered
as contributing factors._[citation

Less
than 10%
of U.S.|223688001

girls|431549007
start|255395001
to
menstruate

90%|264705001|264703008

This age|424144002
