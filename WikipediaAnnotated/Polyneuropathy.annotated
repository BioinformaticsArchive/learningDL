*Polyneuropathy|42345000
*
*
is
a neurological disorder|118940003
that
occurs|272120004
when
many nerves|3057000
throughout the body malfunction simultaneously.|279495008|76797004|79970003|279495008|386585008|79970003|123037004|76797004|79970003|123037004|386585008|79970003

It
may
be
acute|272118002
and
appear
without warning,
or
chronic|90734009
and
develop
gradually
over a longer period|255511005|259037005
of time.|410669006

Many polyneuropathies|260396001|42345000
have
both
motor
and
sensory involvement|262139008|248448006
;
some also
involve|248448006
dysfunction|386585008
of the autonomic nervous system.|72167002

These disorders|64572001
are
often symmetric|70232002|18772005
and
frequently|70232002
affect|4065008
the feet|56459004|259051005
and
hands,|85562004
causing|23981006
weakness,|13791008|260407003
loss
of sensation,|106148006|271712005|272144002
pins-|77444004
and-
needle sensations|79068005|106148006|79068005|272144002
or
burning pain.|36349006

There
are
numerous conditions|260396001|260905004
that
can
cause|23981006|134198009
polyneuropathy.|42345000

Polyneuropathies|42345000
can
be
classified|73504009
in different ways,|263735002
such as
by cause,|134198009
by speed
of progression,|246453008|246450006
or
by the parts|260726005
of the body|279495008|123037004
involved.|248448006

Classes|258391009
of polyneuropathy|42345000
are
also
distinguished
by which part|260726005
of the nerve cell|47220008
is
mainly
affected|247591002|248448006
:
the axon,|60436000
the myelin sheath,|23879005
or
the cell body.|4421005|279495008|4421005|123037004|362837007|279495008|362837007|123037004

Evaluation|386053000
and
classification|73504009
of polyneuropathies|42345000
begins|255395001
with a history|392521001
and
physical exam|5880005
in order to
document|397966007
what the pattern|272135003
of the disease process|64572001|415178003
is
(arms,|40983000
legs,|30021000
distal,|46053002
proximal,|40415009
symmetric|18772005
)
,
when
they
started|385652002
,
how
long|255511005
they
have
lasted
,
if
they
fluctuate|255341006
,
and
what deficits|260372006
and
pain|22253000
are
involved.|248448006

If pain|22253000
is
a factor,
and
it often|70232002
is
,
determining
where
and
how long|255511005
the pain|22253000
has
been
present|52101004|246105001
is
important.

One also|421379005
needs|410525008|103325001
to
know|36692007
what disorders|64572001
are
present|52101004|246105001
within the family|35359004
and
what diseases|64572001
the patient|116154003
may
have.

This
is
vital|260410005
in forming|35810008
a differential diagnosis.|47965005

Although
often diseases|70232002|64572001
are
suggested
by the physical exam|5880005
and
history|392521001
alone,|105529008
testing|272393004
is
still
a large part|255509001|260726005
of the diagnosis.|439401001

Tests|269814003|272393004
which
may
be
employed|224363007
include|55919000
electrodiagnostic testing|272393004
using|260676000
electromyography,|42803009
muscle biopsy,|178263003|309507001
serum creatine kinase (CK),|67922002|75828004
and
antibody testing.|166164009

Nerve biopsy|171612001
is
not
used|394850002
much,|242762006|4757001
but
is
helpful
in determining small fiber neuropathy.|255507004|116272000|386033004|255507004|400293002|386033004|255507004|87028007|386033004|255507004|37202001|386033004

Other tests|74964007|269814003|74964007|272393004
may
be
used|394850002
,
especially
tests|269814003|272393004
for specific disorders|69658003|64572001
associated|47429007
with polyneuropathies.|42345000

Acute polyneuropathy|272118002|42345000
can
have
various causes,|256220008|134198009
including|55919000
infections,
autoimmune reactions,|263680009
toxins,|80917008
certain drugs,|17162000|410942007
and
cancer.|363346000|372087000

Chronic polyneuropathy|90734009|42345000
is
often|70232002
caused|23981006|134198009
by diabetes mellitus|73211009
or
by the excessive use|260378005|277889008|260378005|419385000
of alcohol|419442005|53041004|430837008
(alcoholic polyneuropathy,|7916009
but
a variety
of other less common causes|74964007|72906007|134198009
are
known|36692007
,
including|55919000
nutritional deficiencies,|248325000
and
liver|10200004|181268008
or
kidney failure.|42399005

Transthyretin amyloidogenesis|37959007
is
established to|263748003|385645004
cause|23981006|134198009
polyneuropathy|42345000
in the case|398241000
of inherited mutations|255404009|55446002
and
it
could
be
that wild type transthyretin amyloidogenesis,|262290003|261664005|37959007
which
is
established to|263748003|385645004
cause|23981006|134198009
cardiomyopathy,|57809008
could
also
lead|88488004
to peripheral neuropathy,|42658009
as
transthyretin amyloid diseases|37959007|17602002
can
present|52101004|246105001
as
either
a prominent cardiomyopathy,|4657009|57809008
a peripheral neuropathy,|42658009
or
both.[2][3][4][5]

One Danish study|421379005|110465008|421379005|224699009
in 2002
suggested
a link
between long term exposure|71677004|24932003
to statins|372912004
and
increased risk|35105006|30207005|260366006|30207005
of polyneuropathy,|42345000
[6]
although
other studies|74964007|110465008|74964007|224699009
have
not
confirmed|59156000
this finding.|404684003

If possible, treatment|371930009|276239002|371930009|416118004|60022001|276239002|60022001|416118004
focuses|251776000|87017008|363702006
on the underlying disease.|64572001

Further,|46053002
pain medications|22253000|410942007
may
be
given|419582001
and
physical therapy|91251008
is
used to|394850002
retain|397909002
muscle function.|78718001
