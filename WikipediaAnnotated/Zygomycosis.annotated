is
the broadest term to|90522003
refer|439980006
to infections
caused|23981006|134198009
by _bread mold fungi_|226559002|84489001
of the zygomycota phylum.|106554003

However,
because
zygomycota|106554003
has
been
identified|7882003
as polyphyletic,
and
is
not
included|55919000
in modern fungal classification systems,|414561005|73504009
the diseases|64572001
that Zygomycosis|59277005
can
refer|439980006
to
are
better|3442003
called
by their specific names|69658003
:
*
*mucormycosis|76627001|59277005
*

(

These rare yet serious|84638005|42745003|103356009|42745003
and
potentially life-threatening fungal infections,|224130005|3218000
usually
affect|4065008
the face|89545001|302549007
or
oropharyngeal|31389004
(nose/mouth|260540009|74262004|260540009|123851003|260540009|21082005|260540009|181220002|181195007|74262004|181195007|123851003|181195007|21082005|181195007|181220002
)
cavity.|80967001|91806002|2483006

Zygomycosis type infections|59277005|278321004
are
most often|4757001|70232002
caused|23981006|134198009
by common fungi|72906007|414561005
found|404684003
in soil|415555003
and
decaying vegetation.|125366008|264340003

While
most individuals|125676002|385435006
are
exposed|24932003
to the fungi|414561005
on a regular basis,|17854005|17854005|418836005
those
with immune disorders|41266007
(
immunocompromised|370391006
are
more prone|242762006|1240000
to fungal infection.|3218000

These types|261664005
of infections
are
also common|72906007
after natural disasters,|510009
such as tornadoes|88644004
or
earthquakes,|8766005|217739005
where people|125676002
have
open wounds|125643001
that
have
become
filled
with soil|415555003
or
vegetative matter.[7]

The condition|260905004
may
affect|4065008
the gastrointestinal tract|122865005|279972009
or
the skin.|119325001|39937001|181469002

In non-trauma cases,|398241000|413769002|398241000|413769002
it usually
begins|255395001
in the nose|260540009|181195007
and
paranasal sinuses|2095001
and
is
one|421379005
of the most rapidly|4757001|418694008
spreading|410677005
fungal infections|3218000
in humans.|278412004

Common symptoms|72906007
include|55919000
thrombosis|118927008
and
tissue necrosis.|85756007|6574001

Treatment|276239002|416118004
consists
of prompt
and
intensive antifungal drug therapy|373219008|276239002|373219008|416608005
and
surgery to|83578000
remove|127485006
the infected tissue.|85756007

The prognosis|20481000
varies
vastly
depending
upon an individual patient's circumstances.[8]|125676002|116154003|385435006|116154003

Pathogenic Zygomycosis|264418008|59277005
is
caused|23981006|134198009
by species|69658003
in two orders|420797005
:
Mucorales|106556001
and
Entomophthorales,|106557005
with the former causing far more disease|9130008|23981006|46053002|64572001
than the latter.

These diseases|64572001
are
known|36692007
as "mucormycosis"|76627001|59277005
and
"entomophthoramycosis",|240782002
respectively.[12]

The term oomycosis
is
used to|394850002
describe
oomycete infections.|426619009

These
are
more common|242762006|72906007
in animals,|387961004
notably dogs|448771007
and
horses.|35354009

These
are
heterokonts,
not true fungi.|31874001|414561005

Types|261664005
include|55919000
pythiosis
(
caused|23981006|134198009
by _Pythium insidiosum_|57313005
)
and
lagenidiosis.

Zygomycosis|59277005
has
been
described
in a cat,|448169003|33384004|388626009
where fungal infection|3218000
of the tracheobronchus
led|88488004|236874000
to respiratory disease requiring euthanasia.[14]|50043002|28631002

Zygomycosis|59277005
has
been
found|404684003
in survivors
of the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake|223501002|8766005|223501002|217739005
and
tsunami
and
in survivors
of 2011 Joplin,
Missouri tornado.[15]|224070000|88644004|224070000|217732001
