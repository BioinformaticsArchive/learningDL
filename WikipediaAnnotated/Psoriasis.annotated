(!
play|300776002
/s??ra?.?s?s/
is
an immune-mediated disease|41266007|73510009
that
affects|4065008
the skin.|119325001|39937001|181469002

It
occurs|272120004
when
the immune system|116003000
mistakes
the skin cells|314819008
as a pathogen,|264418008
and
sends
out faulty|255529000|241775008
signals|38952000
that speed up|255532002|353734004
the growth cycle|44180009
of skin cells.|314819008

Psoriasis|9014002
is
not contagious.

However,
psoriasis|9014002
has
been
linked
to an increased risk|35105006|30207005|260366006|30207005
of stroke,|230690007
[2]|260306008
and
treating high blood lipid levels|28995006|124042003|87612001|258395000|28995006|124042003|119273009|258395000
may
lead|88488004
to improvement.

There
are
five types|421820001|261664005
of psoriasis|9014002
:
plaque,|4522001|1522000|38551001
guttate,|1312007
inverse,|255513008
pustular,|255441005
and
erythrodermic.|14297004

The most common form,|4757001|72906007|246176004
plaque psoriasis,|200965009
is
commonly
seen
as red|386713009|371240000
and
white hues|413773004|185984009|371251000
of scaly|19892000|13389002|278111002
patches|36875001
appearing
on the top|421812003
first
layer
of the epidermis|55988001
(skin|119325001|39937001|181469002
).

Some patients,|116154003
though
,
have
no dermatological signs|72670004
or
symptoms.

The name _psoriasis_|9014002
(????????
)
is
from the Greek language,|297494006
meaning|255586005
roughly "itching condition"|424492005|260905004
(_psora_ "itch" + _-sis_ "action,|424492005|129264002
condition"|260905004
).

In plaque psoriasis,|200965009
skin rapidly|119325001|418694008|39937001|418694008|181469002|418694008
accumulates
at these sites,|10546003
which
gives|419582001
it a silvery-white appearance.|41967008|413773004|386548000|41967008|413773004|255412001|41967008|185984009|386548000|41967008|185984009|255412001|41967008|371251000|386548000|41967008|371251000|255412001|371257001|413773004|386548000|371257001|413773004|255412001|371257001|185984009|386548000|371257001|185984009|255412001|371257001|371251000|386548000|371257001|371251000|255412001|406951002|413773004|386548000|406951002|413773004|255412001|406951002|185984009|386548000|406951002|185984009|255412001|406951002|371251000|386548000|406951002|371251000|255412001

Plaques frequently|38551001|70232002
occur|272120004
on the skin|119325001|39937001|181469002
of the elbows|127949000
and
knees,|304679005
but
can
affect|4065008
any area,|42798000
including|55919000
the scalp,|41695006|181480002
palms|107631008
of hands|85562004
and
soles|57999000
of feet,|56459004|259051005
and
genitals.

In contrast
to eczema,|281104002
psoriasis|9014002
is
more likely to|242762006|2931005
be
found|404684003
on the outer side|261074009|182353008
of the joint.|39352004|81087007|302536002

The disorder|64572001
is
a chronic recurring condition|90734009|246455001|260905004|90734009|255227004|260905004
that
varies
in severity|272141005
from minor localized patches to|410599005|255471002|36875001|255606000|255471002|36875001
complete|255594003
body coverage.|279495008|123037004

Fingernails|91456000
and
toenails|76578001
are
frequently|70232002
affected|247591002|248448006
(psoriatic nail dystrophy|238605006
)
and
can
be
seen
as an isolated sign.|46651001|72670004

Psoriasis|9014002
can
also
cause|23981006|134198009
inflammation|257552002
of the joints,|39352004|81087007
which
is
known|36692007
as psoriatic arthritis.|33339001

Between 10?30%
of all people|125676002
with psoriasis also|9014002
have
psoriatic arthritis.[4][5]|33339001

The cause|134198009
of psoriasis|9014002
is
not fully
understood|66216009
,
but
it
is
believed to
have
a genetic component|3950001|246093002|255395001|246093002
and
local psoriatic changes|255470001|243326001|255470001|263703002
can
be
triggered|410658008
by an injury
to the skin|119325001|39937001|181469002
known|36692007
as the Koebner phenomenon.|89321004

Various environmental factors|256220008|102487004
have
been
suggested
as aggravating|162473008
to psoriasis,|9014002
including|55919000
oxidative stress,|262188008
[7] stress,|262188008
withdrawal
of systemic corticosteroid,|31099001|79440004
as well as
other environmental factors,|74964007|102487004
but
few
have
shown
statistical significance.|386134007

There
are
many treatments|260396001|276239002
available,|103328004
but
because of its chronic recurrent nature,|90734009|255227004|277302009
psoriasis|9014002
is
a challenge to
treat.|395077000

Withdrawal
of corticosteroids|79440004
(topical steroid cream|421628006|116566001
)
can
aggravate|162473008
the condition|260905004
due to the 'rebound effect'|253861007
of corticosteroids.[9]|79440004

The symptoms
of psoriasis|9014002
can
manifest|250255003
in a variety
of forms.|246176004

Variants|40885006
include|55919000
plaque,|4522001|1522000|38551001
pustular,|255441005
guttate,|1312007
and
flexural psoriasis.|238600001

This section|62083003|118630004
describes
each type|261664005
(
with ICD-10 code [10]|70199000
).[11]

Psoriasis|9014002
is
a chronic relapsing disease|27624003|263855007|27624003|255318003
of the skin|119325001|39937001|181469002
that
may
be
classified|73504009
into nonpustular
and
pustular types|255441005|261664005
as
follows|367409002
[12]
:

*
*Pustular psoriasis|200973000
*
*
(L40.1-3,
L40.82
)
appears
as raised bumps|260399008
that
are
filled
with noninfectious pus|11311000|119323008
(pustules|271760008
).

The skin|119325001|39937001|181469002
under
and
surrounding|355648006
the pustules|271760008
is
red|386713009|371240000
and
tender.|300820003

Pustular psoriasis|200973000
can
be
localised|255471002
,
commonly
to the hands|85562004
and
feet|56459004|259051005
(palmoplantar pustulosis|27520001
)
,
or
generalised|60132005
with widespread patches|85333001|36875001
occurring|272120004
randomly
on any part|260726005
of the body.|279495008|123037004

Types|261664005

Additional types|260364009|261664005
of psoriasis|9014002
include|55919000
[14]
:

Guttate psoriasis|37042000
(L40.4
)
is
characterized
by numerous small, scaly,|260396001|255507004|19892000|260396001|255507004|13389002|260396001|255507004|278111002
red|386713009|371240000
or
pink,|371243003
teardrop-shaped lesions.|40431001|107644003|40431001|300842002

These numerous spots|260396001|271807003|260396001|285305004
of psoriasis|9014002
appear
over large areas|255509001|42798000
of the body,|279495008|123037004
primarily
the trunk,|22943007|262225004
but
also
the limbs|66019005
and
scalp.|41695006|181480002

Guttate psoriasis|37042000
is
often|70232002
preceded|236874000
by a streptococcal infection,|85769006
typically streptococcal pharyngitis.|43878008

The reverse
is
not true.|31874001

Nail psoriasis|238604005
(L40.86
)
produces
a variety
of changes|243326001|263703002
in the appearance|386548000|255412001
of finger|7569003|302541005
and
toe nails.|76578001

These changes|243326001|263703002
include|55919000
discolouring|47415006
under the nail plate,|72651009
pitting|77855009
of the nails,|72651009
lines|50009006
going
across the nails,|72651009
thickening|263899003
of the skin|119325001|39937001|181469002
under the nail,|72651009|119327009
and
the loosening|51121001
(onycholysis|75789001
and
crumbling
of the nail.|72651009|119327009

Psoriatic arthritis|33339001
(L40.5
)
involves|248448006
joint|39352004|81087007|302536002
and
connective tissue inflammation.|181769001|257552002

Psoriatic arthritis|33339001
can
affect|4065008
any joint,|39352004|81087007|302536002
but
is
most common|4757001|72906007
in the joints|39352004|81087007
of the fingers|7569003|259052003
and
toes.|29707007

This
can
result|394617004
in a sausage-shaped swelling|227020009|107644003|423666004|227020009|107644003|442672001|227020009|300842002|423666004|227020009|300842002|442672001
of the fingers|7569003|259052003
and
toes|29707007
known|36692007
as dactylitis.|264516005

Psoriatic arthritis|33339001
can
also
affect|4065008
the hips,|29836001
knees|304679005
and
spine|421060004|44300000|243930007
(spondylitis.|399096009

About 10?15%
of people|125676002
who
have

and
the geographic tongue|59032001
that
confined
to the dorsal|255551008
and
lateral aspects|49370004
of the tongue mucosa,|8001006
are
believed
to
be
oral manifestations|260548002|250255003|260548002|251190009
of psoriasis,|9014002
as
being
histologically identical|67151002|20323000
to cutaneous psoriasis lesions|95324001|9014002
and
more prevalent|242762006
among psoriasis patients,|9014002|116154003
[15]
although
these conditions|260905004
are
quite common|72906007
in the non-psoriatic population,|385436007|389109008
affecting|247591002|248448006
1%|260305007
to 2.5%|264655001
of the general population.[15]|60132005|385436007|60132005|389109008

Severe cases|24484000|398241000|24484000|413769002
of psoriasis|9014002
have
been
shown
to

health-related quality|263775005|272151006|263496004|263775005|262094002|263496004
of life|224130005
to an extent|255590007
similar
to the effects|253861007
of other chronic diseases,|74964007|27624003
such as depression,|35489007|366979004|255339005
hypertension,|38341003
congestive heart failure|42343007
or
type 2 diabetes.|44054006

Depending
on the severity|272141005
and
location|246267002
of outbreaks,|443684005
individuals|125676002|385435006
may
experience
significant physical discomfort|386134007|5880005|367391008|386134007|5880005|87128005|386134007|19388002|367391008|386134007|19388002|87128005
and
some disability.|21134002

Itching|424492005
and
pain|22253000
can
interfere|78235001
with basic functions,|246464006|418836005|246464006
such as self-care,|384758001
walking|129006008
,
and
sleep.|258158006

Plaques|38551001
on hands|85562004
and
feet|56459004|259051005
can
prevent
individuals|125676002|385435006
from working|261041009
at certain occupations,|17162000|14679004
playing|300776002
some sports,|415577004
and
caring
for family members|303071001
or
a home.|261770009

Plaques|38551001
on the scalp|41695006|181480002
can
be
particularly embarrassing,|263821009
as
flaky plaque|387085005|4522001|387085005|1522000|387085005|38551001|4522001|1522000|38551001
in the hair|386045008|119326000
can
be
mistaken
for dandruff.|156329007|200767005

Individuals|125676002|385435006
with psoriasis|9014002
may
also
feel|285854004
self-conscious
about their appearance|386548000|255412001
and
have
a poor self-image|225508006
that stems
from fear|1402001
of public rejection
and
psychosexual concerns.

Psychological distress|60224009|69328002
can
lead|88488004
to significant depression|386134007|386134007|35489007|386134007|366979004|386134007|255339005
and
social isolation.|422650009

In a 2008 National Psoriasis Foundation survey|9014002|9014002|418836005
of 426 psoriasis sufferers,|9014002
71 percent|264699005|118582008
reported|229059009|223458004
the disease|64572001
was
a significant problem|386134007|55607006
in everyday life.|69620002|224130005

More
than half reported significant feelings|229059009|386134007|285854004|229059009|386134007|223458004|386134007|285854004|223458004|386134007
of self-consciousness|106167005
(63 percent|118582008

and
embarrassment
(58 percent|118582008

More
than one-third|421379005|70905002
said|66049007
they
avoided
social activities|257733005

A 2009 study|110465008|224699009
looked|386548000
at the impact|134293005
of psoriasis|9014002
by
using|260676000
interviews
with dermatologists|18803008

exploring patients viewpoint.|116154003

It
found|404684003
that
in cases|398241000|413769002
of mild|255604002
and
severe psoriasis,|24484000|9014002
itch|424492005
contributed
most
to the diminished health-related quality of life (HRQoL).[19]|1250004|263775005|272151006|405152002|1250004|263775005|262094002|405152002

According to a study|110465008|224699009
published
in 2010
in the Journal
of the American Academy of Dermatology,|394582007
the reliability
of a simple six-point Likert scale|13673007|422218008|273575009

of pruritus|424492005

by patients|116154003
was
validated
in patients|116154003
with moderate|6736007
to severe plaque psoriasis.|24484000|200965009

This
will
allow
better communication,|3442003|263536004

as well as
staging|72589006
and
management|413454004|119270007
of itching.|424492005

It
could
also
allow
future studies to objectively|110465008|224699009
evaluate
the effectiveness|255403003
of therapy|276239002

Several scales|261028005|19892000|261028005|13389002
exist
for measuring|258104002|263571004
the severity|272141005

The degree|258395000|246173007

is
generally
based|418836005
on the following factors|255260001
:
the proportion|8212001
of body surface area|301898006

The Psoriasis Area Severity Index (PASI)|9014002|42798000|272141005|419205000
is
the most widely used measurement tool|4757001|394850002|272391002|86967005
for psoriasis.|9014002

PASI
combines|20909006
the assessment|386053000
of the severity|272141005
of lesions
and
the area|42798000
affected|247591002|248448006
into a single score|125681006|278061009|50607009|278061009
in the range 0
(
no disease|64572001
)
to 72
(maximal disease|56851009|64572001|398303009|64572001
).

Nevertheless,
the PASI
can
be
too unwieldy to
use|277889008|419385000
outside of trials,|110465008
which
has
led|88488004|236874000
to attempts to
simplify
the index|419205000
for clinical use.[24]|58147004|277889008|58147004|419385000

The cause|134198009
of psoriasis|9014002
is
not fully
understood.|66216009

There
are
two main hypotheses|420797005|63161005
about the process|415178003
that
occurs|272120004
in the development|278923009
of the disease.|64572001

The first|255216001|232714002
considers
psoriasis|9014002
as
primarily
a disorder|64572001
of excessive growth|260378005
and
reproduction|263767004
of skin cells.|314819008

The problem|55607006
is
simply
seen
as a fault|241775008
of the epidermis|55988001
and
its keratinocytes.|74447004

The second hypothesis|81170007|257997001|288495006
sees|281004000
the disease|64572001
as
being
an immune-mediated disorder|41266007|73510009
in which
the excessive reproduction|260378005|263767004
of skin cells|314819008
is
secondary|2603003|81170007
to factors
produced
by the immune system.|116003000

T cells|57184004
(
which normally
help
protect
the body|279495008|123037004
against infection
)
become
active,|55561003
migrate
to the dermis|53534000
and
trigger|410658008
the release|58000006|68776005|258760001|129299003|115956009
of cytokines|75777003
(tumor necrosis factor-alpha TNF?,|8612007
in particular
)
which
cause|23981006|134198009
inflammation|257552002
and
the rapid production|255358001
of skin cells.|314819008

It
is
not
known|36692007
what
initiates
the activation
of the T cells.|57184004

The immune-mediated model|255386009|73510009
of psoriasis|9014002
has
been
supported|9096001|243114000
by the observation|103705002
that immunosuppressant medications|372823004|410942007
can
clear|263707001
psoriasis plaques.|9014002|38551001

However,
the role
of the immune system|116003000
is
not fully
understood|66216009
,
and
it
has
recently|6493001
been
reported|229059009|223458004
that
an animal model|387961004
of psoriasis|9014002
can
be
triggered|410658008
in mice|447612001|447482001
lacking|41277001
T cells.|57184004

Animal models,|387961004
however,
reveal|263857004
only
a few aspects|57176003
resembling
human psoriasis.|278412004|9014002

Compromised skin barrier function|64501009
has
a role
in psoriasis susceptibility.[26]|9014002|76522002|9014002|118588007

Psoriasis|9014002
is
a fairly idiosyncratic disease.|56840009|64572001

The majority
of people's experience|125676002
of psoriasis|9014002
is
one|421379005
in which
it
may
worsen|230993007|390772001
or
improve|385425000|3442003|385633008
for no apparent reason.|410666004

Studies|110465008|224699009
of the factors
associated|47429007
with psoriasis|9014002
tend
to
be
based|418836005
on small|255507004
(usually hospital based|418836005|285201006|285201006|418836005
)
samples|123038009
of individuals.|125676002|385435006

These studies|110465008|224699009
tend
to
suffer
from representative issues,|55607006
and
an inability to
tease|247999006
out causal associations|255529000|134198009|263534001
in the face|89545001|302549007
of other|74964007
(possibly|60022001
unknown|261665006

intervening factors.

Conflicting findings|15863006|404684003|15863006
are
often|70232002
reported.|229059009|223458004

Nevertheless,
the first outbreak|255216001|443684005|232714002|443684005
is
sometimes
reported|229059009|223458004
following|255260001
stress|262188008
(physical|5880005|19388002
and
mental
)
,
skin injury,|125592002
and
streptococcal infection.|85769006

Conditions|78326006|260905004
that
have
been
reported|229059009|223458004
as accompanying
a worsening|230993007|231877006
of the disease|64572001
include|55919000
infections,
stress,|262188008
and
changes|243326001|263703002
in season|227553009
and
climate.

Certain medicines,|17162000|410942007
including|55919000
lithium salt,|9765000
beta blockers|373254001
and
the antimalarial drug chloroquine|373287002|373468005
have
been
reported|229059009|223458004
to
trigger|410658008
or
aggravate|162473008
the disease.|64572001

Excessive alcohol consumption,|160592001
smoking|365981007
and
obesity|414915002
may
exacerbate|162473008
psoriasis|9014002
or
make
the management|413454004|119270007

difficult|52925006

perhaps
these comorbidities
are
effects|253861007

causes.|134198009

Hairspray,|67366006

and
hand lotions,|85562004|17519006|302539009|17519006

In 1975,
Stefania Jablonska
and
collaborators
advanced|86005002
a new theory|7147002
that special antibodies|67995009|68498002
tend
to break through
into the lower layers|261122009
of the skin|119325001|39937001|181469002
and
set up|255532002|353734004
a complex series|103360007|13039001
of chemical reactions.[29]|441900009|263851003

Individuals|125676002|385435006
suffering
from the advanced effects|86005002|253861007
of the human immunodeficiency virus,|19030005|86406008
or
HIV,|19030005|86406008|402916007
often|70232002
exhibit
psoriasis.|9014002

This
presents|52101004|246105001
a paradox|27699000
to researchers,
as
traditional therapies|263901007|276239002
that
reduce|260400001
T-cell|57184004
counts|258734002
generally
cause|23981006|134198009
psoriasis to|9014002
improve.|385425000|3442003|385633008

Yet,
as
CD4-T-cell counts|118218001
decrease|260400001|260370003
with the progression|246453008|246450006
of HIV,|19030005|86406008|402916007
psoriasis worsens.|9014002|230993007|9014002|390772001

In addition,|260364009
HIV|19030005|86406008|402916007
is
typically
characterized
by a strong Th2 cytokine profile,|260404005|75777003
whereas
psoriasis vulgaris|200975007
is
characterized
by a strong Th1 secretion pattern.|260404005|46242002|272135003

It
is
hypothesized
that
the diminished CD4-T-Cell presence|1250004|57184004|386397008
causes|134198009
an overactivation
of CD8-T-cells,|117539009
which
are
responsible|394851003
for the exacerbation
of psoriasis|9014002
in HIV positive patients.|402916007|116154003

It
is
important to
remember
that
most individuals|125676002|385435006
with psoriasis|9014002
are
otherwise healthy,|263775005
and
the presence|386397008
of HIV|19030005|86406008|402916007
accounts
for less|276139006|263796003
than 1%|260305007
of cases.|398241000|413769002

The prevalence
of psoriasis|9014002
in the HIV positive population|402916007|385436007|402916007|389109008
ranges
from 1|260305007
to 6 percent,|118582008
which
is
about three times|421291004|410669006|421291004|417929005

Psoriasis|9014002

and
untreatable

Psoriasis|9014002
occurs|272120004
more likely|242762006|2931005
in dry skin|16386004
than oily|42273000
or
well-moisturized skin,|20572008|119325001|20572008|39937001|20572008|181469002

specifically
after an external skin injury|263750006|119325001|263750006|39937001|263750006|181469002|261074009|125592002
such as a scratch|53181008
or
cut|283396008
(
see|281004000
Koebner phenomenon.|89321004

This
is
believed to
be
caused|23981006|134198009
by an infection,
in which
the infecting organism|410653004
thrives
under dry skin|16386004
conditions|78326006|260905004
with minimal skin oil,|255605001|420540006|255604002|420540006
which otherwise
protects
skin|119325001|39937001|181469002
from infections.

The case|398241000
for psoriasis|9014002
is
opposite
to the case|398241000
of athlete's foot,|6020002
which
occurs|272120004
because of a fungus infection|3218000
under wet conditions|17461003|260905004
as
opposed to
dry|13880007
in psoriasis.|9014002

This infection
induces|16404004
inflammation,|257552002
which
causes|134198009
the symptoms commonly
associated|47429007
with psoriasis,|9014002
such as itching|424492005
and
rapid skin turnover,|255358001|119325001|261032004|255358001|39937001|261032004|255358001|181469002|261032004
and
leads|88488004|236874000
to drier skin,|119325001|39937001|181469002
as
the infecting organism|410653004
absorbs
the moisture|17461003
that
would
otherwise
go
to the skin.|119325001|39937001|181469002

To
prevent
dry skin|16386004
and
reduce|260400001
psoriasis symptoms,|9014002
it
is
advised to|424900004
not
use|277889008|419385000
shower scrubs,
as
they
not only
damage|37782003
skin|119325001|39937001|181469002
by leaving tiny scratches,|7771000|40590001|7771000|53181008|90737002|40590001|90737002|53181008

they also
scrape|56757003|258431006
off the naturally
occurring|272120004
skin oil.|420540006

Additionally,
moisturizers
can
be
applied|410618006
to
moisturize
the skin,|119325001|39937001|181469002

The main value|63161005
of genetic studies|3950001|110465008|3950001|224699009|255395001|110465008|255395001|224699009
is
they
identify|7882003
molecular mechanisms|290005005|257544000
and
pathways
for further study|46053002|110465008|46053002|224699009
and
potential drug targets.[35]|30207005|410942007

Classic genomewide linkage analysis|255301002|272389005|255333006|272389005
has
identified nine locations (loci)|7882003|422113007|246267002
on different chromosomes|263735002|91272006
associated|47429007
with psoriasis.|9014002

They
are
called
psoriasis susceptibility 1|9014002|76522002|9014002|118588007
through 9
(PSORS1
through PSORS9
).

Within those loci
are
genes.|67271001

Many
of those genes|67271001
are
on pathways
that
lead|88488004
to inflammation.|257552002

Certain variations|17162000|40885006
(mutations|55446002
)
of those genes|67271001
are
commonly
found|404684003
in psoriasis.[35]|9014002

The major determinant|255603008
is
PSORS1,
which probably
accounts
for 35?50%
of its heritability.|255404009

It
controls|54776003|31509003
genes|67271001
that
affect|4065008
the immune system|116003000
or
encode
proteins|88878007
that
are
found|404684003
in the skin|119325001|39937001|181469002
in greater amounts|263768009|107651007
in psoriasis.|9014002

PSORS1
is
located
on chromosome 6|45202000
in the MHC,
which
controls|54776003|31509003
important immune functions.

Three genes|421291004|67271001
in the PSORS1 locus
have
a strong association|260404005|263534001|260404005|272151006
with psoriasis vulgaris|200975007
:
HLA-C variant HLA-Cw6,|60904002|40885006
which
encodes
a MHC class I protein|258392002|88878007
;
CCHCR1,
variant WWC,|40885006
which
encodes
a coiled protein|261363007|88878007
that
is
overexpressed
in psoriatic epidermis|55988001
;
and
CDSM,
variant allele 5,|40885006|9109004
which
encodes
corneodesmosin,
which
is
expressed
in the granular|15933001
and
cornified layers
of the epidermis|55988001
and
upregulated
in psoriasis.[35]|9014002

Genome-wide association scans|18470003|90522003|263534001|18470003|90522003|272151006
have
identified other genes|7882003|67271001
which
are
altered
to characteristic variants|40885006
in psoriasis.|9014002

Some
of these genes|67271001
express
inflammatory signal proteins,|88878007
which
affect|4065008
cells|4421005
in the immune system|116003000
that
are
also
involved|248448006
in psoriasis.|9014002

Some
of these genes|67271001
are
also
involved|248448006
in other autoimmune diseases.[35]|74964007|85828009

Two major genes|420797005|255603008|67271001
under investigation|386053000
are
IL12B
on chromosome 5q,|91272006
which
expresses
interleukin-12B|38476002
;
and
IL23R
on chromosome 1p,|91272006
which
expresses
the interleukin-23 receptor,|38476002|264657009|116647005
and
is
involved|248448006
in T cell differentiation.|57184004

T cells|57184004
are
involved|248448006
in the inflammatory process|415178003
that
leads|88488004|236874000
to psoriasis.[35]|9014002

These genes|67271001
are
on the pathway
that ends|261782000
up upregulating tumor necrosis factor-?|8612007
and
nuclear factor ?B,|84640000|259787006
two genes|420797005|67271001
that
are
involved|248448006
in inflammation.[35]|257552002

Recently|6493001
the first gene directly|255216001|67271001|232714002|67271001
linked
to psoriasis|9014002
has
been
identified.|7882003

Studies|110465008|224699009
have
suggested
that
a rare mutation|84638005|55446002|103356009|55446002
in the gene encoding|67271001
for the CARD14 protein|88878007
plus an environmental trigger|276339004|276339004|410658008
was
enough to
cause|23981006|134198009
plaque psoriasis|200965009
(
the most common form|4757001|72906007|246176004
of psoriasis|9014002
).[36][37]

In psoriasis,|9014002
immune cells|255386009|4421005
move|302000008|384598002|370125004
from the dermis|53534000
to the epidermis,|55988001
where
they
stimulate
skin cells|314819008
(keratinocytes|74447004
)
to
proliferate.

Psoriasis|9014002
does
not
seem
to
be
a true autoimmune disease.|31874001|85828009

In an autoimmune disease,|85828009
the immune system|116003000
confuses|286933003
an
outside antigen|7120007
with a normal body component,|17621005|279495008|246093002|17621005|123037004|246093002|258744000|279495008|246093002|258744000|123037004|246093002
and
attacks|216299002
them both.

But
in psoriasis,|9014002
the inflammation|257552002
does
not
seem
to
be
caused|23981006|134198009
by
outside antigens|7120007
(
although
DNA|24851008
does
have
an immunostimulatory effect|253861007
).

Researchers
have
identified many|7882003
of the immune cells|255386009|4421005
involved|248448006
in psoriasis,|9014002
and
the chemical signals|441900009
they
send
to each other to
coordinate|162258009
inflammation.|257552002

At the end|261782000|422117008
of this process,|415178003
immune cells,|255386009|4421005
such as dendritic cells
and
T cells,|57184004
move|302000008|384598002|370125004
from the dermis|53534000
to the epidermis,|55988001
secreting
chemical signals,|441900009
such as tumor necrosis factor-?,|8612007
interleukin-1?,|116722001|50762005
and
interleukin-6,|30965005|22766004
which
cause|23981006|134198009
inflammation,|257552002
and
interleukin-22,|38476002
which
causes|134198009
keratinocytes to|74447004
proliferate.[35]

The immune system|116003000
consists
of an innate immune system,|116003000
and
an adaptive immune system.|116003000

In the innate system,|246333005
immune cells|255386009|4421005
have
receptors|116647005
that
have
evolved|59381007
to
target
specific proteins|69658003|88878007
and
other antigens|74964007|7120007
which
are
commonly
found|404684003
on pathogens.|264418008

In the adaptive immune system,|116003000
immune cells|255386009|4421005
respond
to proteins|88878007
and
other antigens|74964007|7120007
that
they
may
never
have
seen
before,|236874000|421718005
which
are
presented|246105001
to them
by other cells.|74964007|4421005

The innate system often|246333005|70232002
passes
antigens|7120007
on
to the adaptive system.|246333005

When
the immune system|116003000
makes
a mistake,
and
identifies|7882003
a healthy part|263775005|260726005
of the body|279495008|123037004
as a foreign antigen,|7120007
the immune system|116003000
attacks|216299002
that protein,|88878007
as
it
does
in autoimmunity.|4301008

In psoriasis,|9014002
DNA|24851008
is
an inflammatory stimulus.|8927009

DNA|24851008
stimulates
the receptors|116647005
on plasmacytoid dendritic cells,
which
produce
interferon-?,|49327004
an immune stimulatory signal|255386009|36645008
(cytokine|75777003
).

In psoriasis,|9014002
keratinocytes|74447004
produce
antimicrobial peptides.|250428009|52642002

In response
to dendritic cells
and
T cells,|57184004
they also
produce
cytokines,|75777003
such as interleukin-1,|116722001|50762005
interleukin-6,|30965005|22766004
and
tumor necrosis factor-?,|8612007
which
signals|38952000
more inflammatory cells to|242762006|256923004
arrive
and
produces
further inflammation.[35]|46053002|257552002

Dendritic cells
bridge|277035007
the innate
and
adaptive immune system.|116003000

They
are
increased|35105006|260366006
in psoriatic lesions
and
induce|16404004
the proliferation|30217000
of T cells|57184004
and
type 1 helper T cells.|418698006

Certain dendritic cells|17162000
can
produce
tumor necrosis factor-?,|8612007
which
calls
more immune cells|242762006|255386009|4421005
and
stimulates
more inflammation.|242762006|257552002

Targeted immunotherapy,|76334006
and
psoralen and ultraviolet A (PUVA) therapy,|46467001
reduces|260400001
the number|410680006|410681005
of dendritic cells.[35]

T cells|57184004
move|302000008|384598002|370125004
from the dermis|53534000
into the epidermis.|55988001

They
are
attracted
to the epidermis|55988001
by alpha-1 beta-1 integrin,|103119009|52095000|103119009|260989008|263660008|259949008
a signalling molecule|38952000|290005005
on the collagen|61472002
in the epidermis.|55988001

Psoriatic T cells|57184004
secrete
interferon-?|49327004
and
interleukin-17.|38476002

Interleukin-17|38476002
is
also
associated|47429007
with interleukin-22.|38476002

Interleukin-22|38476002
induces|16404004
keratocytes to|397052000
proliferate.[35]

One hypothesis|421379005
is
that psoriasis|9014002
involves|248448006
a defect|6920004
in regulatory T cells,|57184004
and
in the regulatory cytokine interleukin-10.[35]|75777003|11267006

A diagnosis|439401001
of psoriasis|9014002
is
usually
based|418836005
on the appearance|386548000|255412001
of the skin|119325001|39937001|181469002
;
there
are
no special blood tests|67995009|252275004
or
diagnostic procedures.|103693007

Sometimes,
a skin biopsy,|240977001
or
scraping,|56757003
may
be
needed|410525008|103325001
to
rule|10828004
out other disorders|255529000|64572001
and
to
confirm|59156000
the diagnosis.|439401001

Skin|119325001|39937001|181469002
from a biopsy|86273004
will
show
clubbed rete pegs|367004
if
positive|258758003|10828004
for psoriasis.|9014002

Another sign|72670004
of psoriasis|9014002
is
that
when
the plaques|38551001
are
scraped|56757003|258431006
,
one|421379005
can
see|281004000
pinpoint bleeding|131148009
from the skin|119325001|39937001|181469002
below
(Auspitz's sign.|67299005

There
are
a number|410680006|410681005
of different treatment options|263735002|276239002|263735002|416118004
for psoriasis.|9014002

Typically topical agents|419487009
are
used|394850002
for mild disease,|255604002|64572001
phototherapy|31394004
for moderate disease,|6736007|64572001
and
systemic agents|31099001|260872001
for severe disease.[38]|24484000|64572001|264670000

Bath solutions|8537005
(epsom salt
)
and
moisturizers,
mineral oil,|111089004
and
petroleum jelly|25307002
may
help
soothe affected skin|247591002|119325001|247591002|39937001|247591002|181469002|248448006|119325001|248448006|39937001|248448006|181469002
and
reduce|260400001
the dryness|13880007
which
accompanies
the build-up|255532002|353734004
of skin|119325001|39937001|181469002
on psoriatic plaques.|38551001

Medicated creams|255621006
and
ointments|385101003
applied|410618006
directly
to psoriatic plaques|38551001

of plaques.|38551001

Ointment|385101003
and
creams|255621006
containing|42504009
coal tar,|53034005
dithranol|387293003
(anthralin|387293003
)
,
corticosteroids|79440004
like desoximetasone|387473009
(Topicort|387473009
)
,
fluocinonide,|396060009
vitamin D3 analogues|108943009|105029001
(
for example,
calcipotriol,|395766004
and
retinoids|372579009
are
routinely
used.|394850002

The use|277889008|419385000
of the Finger tip unit|312543003|258666001
may
be
helpful
in guiding|106384005|303479009
how
much topical treatment to|276239002|416118004|359540000|276239002|359540000|416118004
use.|277889008|419385000

The mechanism|257544000
of action|129264002
of each
is
probably different,|263735002
but
they all
help
to
normalise
skin cell production|314819008
and
reduce|260400001
inflammation.|257552002

Activated vitamin D|71516007|30178006
and
its analogues
can
inhibit|61511001
skin cell proliferation.|314819008|30217000

Phototherapy|31394004
in the form|246176004
of sunlight|49926000
has
long|255511005
been
used|394850002
effectively
for treatment.|276239002|416118004

Wavelengths|246522008
of 311?313 nm
are
most effective|4757001|255403003|4757001|254648000
and
special lamps|67995009|34160005
have
been
developed
for this application.|410618006

The exposure time|71677004|410669006|24932003|410669006
should
be
controlled|31509003
to
avoid
over exposure|21481007|71677004|21481007|24932003
and
burning|90673000|62404004
of the skin.|119325001|39937001|181469002

The UVB lamps|34160005
should
have
a timer|22251003
that
will
turn off|282987006
the lamp|34160005
when
the time ends.|410669006|261782000

The amount|107651007
of light|56242006|371268001
used|394850002
is
determined
by a person's skin type.|67331009|119325001|67331009|39937001|67331009|181469002

Increased rates|35105006|260366006
of cancer|363346000|372087000
from treatment|276239002|416118004
appear
to
be
small.[38]|255507004|264670000

Psoralen|419047007
and
ultraviolet A phototherapy|415770004|31394004
(PUVA

of psoralen|419047007
with exposure|71677004|24932003
to ultraviolet A (UVA) light.|41355003

The mechanism|257544000
of action|129264002
of PUVA
is
unknown|261665006
,
but
probably
involves|248448006
activation
of psoralen|419047007
by UVA light,|56242006|371268001
which
inhibits|61511001
the abnormally rapid production|255358001
of the cells|4421005
in psoriatic skin.|119325001|39937001|181469002

There
are
multiple mechanisms|260396001|257544000
of action|129264002
associated|47429007
with PUVA,
including|55919000
effects|253861007
on the skin immune system.|39937001|255386009|119325001|116003000|39937001|116003000|181469002|116003000

PUVA
is
associated|47429007
with nausea,|422587007
headache,|25064002
fatigue,|84229001
burning,|90673000|62404004
and
itching.|424492005

Long-term treatment|276239002|416118004
is
associated|47429007
with squamous cell carcinoma|402815007

and
phototherapy|31394004
is
treated|28995006
by medications|410942007
taken|419652001
internally|260521003
by pill|46992007
or
injection|28289002|385218009|129326001
(systemic|31099001
).

Patients|116154003
undergoing
systemic treatment|31099001|276239002|31099001|416118004
are
required
to
have
regular blood|17854005|87612001|17854005|119273009
and
liver function tests|26958001
because of the toxicity
of the medication.|410942007

Pregnancy|289908002
must
be
avoided
for the majority
of these treatments.|276239002

Most people|125676002
experience
a recurrence|246455001
of psoriasis|9014002
after systemic treatment|31099001|276239002|31099001|416118004
is
discontinued.|410546004

The three main traditional systemic treatments|421291004|63161005|263901007|31099001|276239002
are
methotrexate,|387381009
cyclosporine|387467008
and
retinoids.|372579009

Methotrexate|387381009
and
cyclosporine|387467008
are
immunosuppressant drugs|372823004|410942007
;
retinoids|372579009
are
synthetic forms|246176004
of vitamin A.|82622003

Patients|116154003
taking|419652001
methotrexate|387381009
are
prone|1240000
to ulcerations.|429040005

Methotrexate exposure|387381009|71677004|387381009|24932003
may
contribute
to post-surgical events.[40]|288563008|83578000|272379006|259031006

Biologics
are
manufactured
proteins|88878007
that
interrupt|261017006
the immune process|255386009|415178003
involved|248448006
in psoriasis.|9014002

Unlike generalised immunosuppressant therapies|60132005|86553008
such as methotrexate,|387381009
biologics focus|87017008|363702006
on specific aspects|69658003
of the immune function
leading|236874000
to psoriasis.|9014002

These drugs|410942007
(interleukin antagonists|38476002|58516001
)
are
relatively new,|7147002
and
their long-term impact|134293005
on immune function
is
unknown|261665006
,
but
they
have
proven|277025001
effective|255403003|254648000
in treating psoriasis|28995006|9014002
and
psoriatic arthritis.|33339001

Biologics
are
usually
given|419582001
by self-injection|28289002|385218009|129326001
or
in a doctor's office.

In the United Kingdom|223860005
in 2005,
the British Association of Dermatologists (BAD)|263534001|18803008|272151006|18803008
published
guidelines
for use|277889008|419385000
of biological interventions|12893009|225334002
in psoriasis.|9014002

A UK national register|229053005
called
the BAD Biological Register (BADBIR)|556001|12893009|229053005
has
been
set up|255532002|353734004
to
collect
valuable information
on side effects
and
benefits
and
will
be
used|394850002
to
inform|410938009|223458004
doctors|309343006
on
how best to
use|277889008|419385000
biological agents
and
similar drugs.|410942007

Two drugs|420797005|410942007
that
target
T cells|57184004
are
efalizumab|407005009
and
alefacept.|398691006

Efalizumab|407005009
is
a monoclonal antibody|49616005
which
blocks|26036001
the molecules|290005005
that dendritic cells
use|277889008|419385000
to
communicate|288577006
with T cells.|57184004

It also
blocks|26036001
the adhesion molecules|42685002|290005005
on the endothelial cells|45709008
that line blood vessels,|50009006|59820001
which
attract
T cells.|57184004

However,
it
suppressed|245780008
the immune system's ability to|116003000|371150009
control|31509003
normally harmless viruses,|49872002
which
led|88488004|236874000
to fatal brain infections.|399166001|12738006|399166001|258335003

Efalizumab|407005009
was
voluntarily
withdrawn|247755007
from the
US
market|284440009
in April,
2009
by the manufacturer.

Alefacept|398691006
also
blocks|26036001
the molecules|290005005
that dendritic cells
use|277889008|419385000
to
communicate|288577006
with T cells|57184004
and
even
causes|134198009
natural killer cells to|259717003
kill|248007002
T cells|57184004
as a way
of controlling inflammation.[35]|54776003|257552002|31509003|257552002

Several monoclonal antibodies (MAbs)|261028005|49616005
target
cytokines,|75777003
the molecules|290005005
that cells|4421005
use|277889008|419385000
to
send
inflammatory signals
to each other.

TNF-?
is
one|421379005
of the main executor inflammatory cytokines.|63161005|75777003

Four MAbs|421534005|49616005
(infliximab,|386891004
adalimumab,|407317001
golimumab|442318002
and
certolizumab pegol|430307008
and
one recombinant TNF-?|421379005
decoy receptor,|116647005
etanercept,|387045004
have
been
developed
against TNF-?
to
inhibit|61511001
TNF-?
signaling.|38952000

Additional monoclonal antibodies|260364009|49616005
have
been
developed
against pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-12/IL-23|52541003|75777003|6411000|264657009
and
Interleukin-17 [42]|38476002
and
inhibit|61511001
the inflammatory pathway
at a different point|263735002
than the anti-TNF-?
antibodies.|68498002

IL-12|6411000
and
IL-23|224058004|264657009|223609006|264657009
share
a common domain,|72906007
p40,
which
is
the target
of the recently FDA-approved ustekinumab.|6493001|9571008|443465002

Ustekinumab|443465002
(IL-12/IL-23 blocker|6411000|264657009
)
was
shown
to
have
higher efficacy|75540009|371879000
than high-dose etanercept|261829003|387045004
over a 12-week period|258705008|259037005|259038000|259037005
in patients|116154003
with psoriasis.[43]|9014002

In 2008,
the FDA
approved three new treatment options[44] available|9571008|421291004|7147002|276239002|103328004|9571008|421291004|7147002|416118004|103328004
to psoriasis patients|9014002|116154003

treat|395077000
moderate|6736007
to severe psoriasis|24484000|9014002
;
and
3
)
the biologic drug adalimumab|12893009|410942007|407317001
(brand name Humira
)
was
also
approved|9571008
to
treat|395077000
moderate|6736007
to severe psoriasis.|24484000|9014002

Adalimumab|407317001
had
already
been
approved|9571008
to
treat|395077000
psoriatic arthritis.|33339001

The most recent biologic drug|4757001|6493001|12893009|410942007
that
has
been
approved|9571008
to
treat|395077000
moderate|6736007
to severe psoriasis,|24484000|9014002
as of 2010,
is
ustekinumab|443465002
(brand name Stelara
).

Medications|410942007
with the least potential|276139006|30207005|263796003|30207005
for adverse reactions|281647001
are
preferentially
employed.|224363007

If
the treatment goal|276239002|410518001|416118004|410518001
is
not
achieved
,
then therapies|276239002
with greater potential toxicity|263768009|30207005
may
be
used.|394850002

Medications|410942007
with significant toxicity|386134007
are
reserved
for severe unresponsive psoriasis.|24484000|20646008|9014002|24484000|422768004|9014002

This
is
called
the psoriasis treatment ladder.|9014002|276239002|52520009|9014002|416118004|52520009

As a first step,|255216001|398298007|232714002|398298007
medicated ointments|385101003
or
creams,|255621006
called
topical treatments,|276239002|359540000|276239002
are
applied|410618006
to the skin.|119325001|39937001|181469002

If topical treatment|276239002|416118004|359540000|276239002|359540000|416118004
fails
to
achieve
the desired goal,|410518001
then
the next step|18769003|398298007|255260001|398298007
would
be
to
expose|24932003
the skin|119325001|39937001|181469002
to ultraviolet (UV) radiation.|41355003

This type|261664005
of treatment|276239002|416118004
is
called phototherapy.|31394004

The third step|70905002|398298007
involves|248448006
the use|277889008|419385000
of medications|410942007
which
are
taken|419652001
internally|260521003
by pill|46992007
or
injection.|28289002|385218009|129326001

This approach
is
called systemic treatment.|31099001|276239002|31099001|416118004

A 2010 meta-analysis|272389005
compares
the change|243326001|263703002
in Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) improvement|9014002|42798000|272141005|419205000
from baseline
in 22 trials.|110465008

The combination therapy|229554006
for moderate|6736007
to severe psoriasis|24484000|9014002
using|260676000
psoralen with ultraviolet A (PUVA)|419047007|415770004
plus
acitretin|386938006
shows
a 97.3% PASI improvement|260309001|264708004
from baseline.

Therapy limitations|276239002|246175000
need|410525008|103325001
to
be
taken|419652001
into consideration
in the treatment|276239002|416118004
of moderate|6736007
to severe psoriasis,|24484000|9014002
such as the increased risk|35105006|30207005|260366006|30207005
of skin cancer|372130007
with phototherapy|31394004
and
birth defects|276654001
with acitretin.[46]|386938006

Some studies|110465008|224699009
suggest
psoriasis symptoms|9014002
can
be
relieved|398004007
by changes|243326001|263703002
in diet|41829006
and
lifestyle.|60134006

Fasting periods,|16985007|259037005
low energy diets|77806000
and
vegetarian diets|80714005
have
improved psoriasis symptoms|385425000|9014002|3442003|9014002
in some studies,|110465008|224699009
[47]
and
diets|41829006
supplemented|373453009
with fish oil|346441008
(
in this study cod liver oil|110465008|126082008|224699009|126082008
have
also
shown
beneficial effects.|253861007

Fish oils|346441008
are
rich|224166006
in the two omega-3 fatty acids eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA)|420797005|226367006|31979005|420797005|226365003|226367006
and
docosahexaenoic acid (DHA)|226368001
and
contain|42504009
Vitamin E,|37237003
furthermore cod liver oil|126082008
contains|42504009
Vitamin A|82622003
and
Vitamin D.|71516007|30178006

The severity|272141005
of psoriasis symptoms|9014002
may
also
be
influenced
by lifestyle habits|60134006|90275003
related|272151006|262094002
to alcohol,|419442005|53041004|430837008
smoking|365981007
,
weight,|27113001|272102008|39857003
sleep,|258158006
stress|262188008
and
exercise.[48]|61686008

It
has
been
suggested
that cannabis|398705004|22924007
might
treat|395077000
psoriasis,|9014002
due to the anti-inflammatory properties|330901000|370130000|330901000|116685008
of its cannabinoids,|421921003
and
their regulatory effects|253861007
on the immune system.|116003000

The adverse effects
of cannabis|398705004|22924007
might
be
avoided
with a topical preparation|350088003
or
by the use|277889008|419385000
of
(
a
)
more specific endocannabinoid receptor agonist|242762006|69658003|116647005|102498003
(s),[50]|288495006

Psoriasis|9014002
is
typically
a lifelong condition.|260905004

There
is
currently|15240007
no cure,
but
various treatments|256220008|276239002
can
help
to
control|31509003
the symptoms.

Many
of the most effective agents|4757001|255403003|260872001|4757001|254648000|260872001
used|394850002
to
treat|395077000
severe psoriasis|24484000|9014002
carry|288345009
an increased risk|35105006|30207005|260366006|30207005
of significant morbidity|386134007
including|55919000
skin cancers,|372130007
lymphoma|118600007
and
liver disease.|235856003

However,
the majority
of people's experience|125676002
of psoriasis|9014002
is
that
of minor localized patches,|410599005|255471002|36875001|255606000|255471002|36875001
particularly
on the elbows|127949000
and
knees,|304679005
which
can
be
treated|28995006
with topical medication.|410942007|359540000|410942007

Psoriasis|9014002
can
get
worse|230993007|390772001|231877006
over time,|410669006
but
it
is
not possible to|371930009|60022001
predict
who
will
go
on to
develop
extensive psoriasis|41118005|9014002
or
those
in whom
the disease|64572001
may
appear
to
vanish.

Individuals|125676002|385435006
will
often|70232002
experience
flares
and
remissions|277022003
throughout their lives.|224130005

Controlling|54776003|31509003
the signs|72670004
and
symptoms typically
requires
lifelong therapy.|276239002

According to one study,|421379005|110465008|421379005|224699009
[52] psoriasis|9014002

This increased risk|35105006|30207005|260366006|30207005

Psoriasis|9014002

The prevalence

The study|110465008|224699009

35%

Studies|110465008|224699009

psoriasis.|9014002

The concordance
is
around 20%
for dizygotic twins.|313416000|237246007

These findings|404684003
suggest
both a genetic predisposition|47708004

an environmental response|276339004
in developing psoriasis.[55]|9014002|264691008

Onset|77374008

In more recent|242762006|6493001
times psoriasis|9014002
was
frequently|70232002
described
as a variety
of leprosy._[citation|81004002

The Greeks|1451003
used|394850002
the term lepra
(?????
)
for scaly skin conditions.|271761007|78326006|271761007|260905004

They
used|394850002
the term psora to
describe
itchy skin conditions.|424492005|95320005

It
became
known|36692007
as
_Willan's lepra_
in the late 18th century|260383002
when
English dermatologists Robert Willan|297487008|18803008|25804004|18803008
and
Thomas Bateman
differentiated|263933003
it
from other skin diseases.|74964007|95320005

Leprosy,|81004002

is
distinguished
by the regular, circular form|17854005|354652004|246176004
of patches,|36875001
while
psoriasis|9014002
is
always irregular.|49608001

Willan
identified|7882003
two categories|420797005
:
_leprosa graecorum_
and
_psora leprosa_.[57]

It
was
not
until 1841
that
the condition|260905004
was
finally
given|419582001
the name _psoriasis_|9014002
by the Viennese dermatologist Ferdinand|18803008
von Hebra.

The name
is
derived
from the Greek word _psora_|1451003|255373000
which means _|255586005
to itch_.[58]|424492005

It
was
