In this Wikipedia article
*
*mastitis|45198002
*
*
is
used|394850002
in the original sense|19535007|106148006
of the definition
as inflammation|257552002
of the breast|76752008|181131000
with additional qualifiers|260364009
where appropriate.

It
is
called puerperal mastitis|86216003
when
it
occurs|272120004
in lactating mothers|83036002|72705000
and
*
*non-puerperal|255408007

Mastitis|45198002
can

in rare cases,|84638005|398241000|84638005|413769002|103356009|398241000|103356009|413769002
occur|272120004
in men.|339947000

Inflammatory breast cancer|254840009
has
symptoms
very similar|260358002
to mastitis|45198002
and
must
be
ruled|10828004
out.|255529000

The symptoms
are
similar
for puerperal|255410009
and
nonpuerperal mastitis|83620003
but
predisposing factors
and
treatment|276239002|416118004
can
be
very different.|260358002|263735002

Puerperal mastitis|86216003
is
the inflammation|257552002
of breast|76752008|181131000
in connection|263538003
with pregnancy,|289908002
breastfeeding|169741004
or
weaning.|37328000

Since
one|421379005
of the most prominent symptoms|4757001|4657009
is
tension|53489000
and
engorgement|30098003
of the breast,|76752008|181131000
it
is
thought to|88952004
be
caused|23981006|134198009
by blocked milk ducts|248834000
or
milk excess.|3718001|260378005|119321005|260378005|70813002|260378005

It
is
relatively common|72906007
;
estimates|414135002
range
depending
on methodology
between 5-33%.|264706000|264667004|264605009|264667004

However only about 0.4-0.5%|260316000
of breastfeeding mothers|169741004|72705000
develop
an abscess.|128477000

The term nonpuerperal mastitis|83620003
describes
inflammatory lesions
of the breast|76752008|181131000
occurring|272120004
unrelated|262241003
to pregnancy|289908002

Lactation mastitis usually|169741004|45198002|63158009|45198002
affects|4065008
only one breast|50607009|421379005|76752008|50607009|421379005|181131000|420295001|421379005|76752008|420295001|421379005|181131000
and
the symptoms
can
develop
quickly.

The signs|72670004
and
symptoms usually
appear
suddenly
and
they
include|55919000
:

Some women|224526002
may
also
experience
flu-like symptoms|315642008
such as
:

Contact|11723008|70862002
should
be
made
with a health care provider
with special breastfeeding competence|67995009|169741004|32082000
as soon
as the patient|116154003
recognizes
the combination|89780004
of signs|72670004
and
symptoms.

Most
of the women|224526002
first
experience
the flu-like symptoms|315642008
and
just
after
they
may
notice
a sore red area|247348008|386713009|42798000|247348008|371240000|42798000|279074008|386713009|42798000|279074008|371240000|42798000|410713007|386713009|42798000|410713007|371240000|42798000
on the breast.|76752008|181131000

Also,
women|224526002
should
seek
medical care|74188005
if
they
notice
any abnormal discharge|263654008|307488001|263654008|58000006
from the nipples,|24142002
if
breast pain|53430007
is
making
it difficult to|52925006
function|246464006
each day|258703001|259032004
or
they
have
prolonged|255224006
,
unexplained breast pain.|53430007

Since
the 1980s mastitis|45198002
has
often|70232002
been
divided|422033008
into non-infectious
and
infectious sub-groups.|261089000|261586004|261089000|160481000|118555000|261586004|118555000|160481000

However,
recent research [6]|6493001
suggests
that
it
may
not
be
feasible to
make
divisions|118630004
in this way.

It
has
been
shown
that types|261664005
and
amounts|107651007
of potentially pathogenic bacteria in breast milk|264418008|409822003|226789007
are
not
correlated
to the severity|272141005
of symptoms.

Moreover,
although
only 15%|50607009|420295001
of women|224526002
with mastitis|45198002
in Kvist
et
al.'s study|110465008|224699009
were
given|419582001
antibiotics,|255631004
all
recovered|74822006
and
few
had
recurring symptoms.|246455001|255227004

Many healthy breastfeeding women|263775005|169741004|224526002
wishing
to
donate
breast milk|226789007
have
potentially pathogenic bacteria|264418008|409822003
in their milk|3718001|119321005|70813002
but
have
no symptoms
of mastitis.|45198002

Mastitis typically|45198002
develops
when
the milk|3718001|119321005|70813002
is
not properly
removed|127485006
from the breast.|76752008|181131000

Milk stasis|3718001|19685008|119321005|19685008|70813002|19685008
can
lead|88488004
to the milk ducts|3718001|343011009|119321005|343011009|70813002|343011009
in the breasts|76752008
becoming
blocked,|26036001|112232007
as
the breast milk|226789007
not
being
properly
and
regularly
expressed.

It
has
also
been
suggested
that blocked milk ducts|248834000
can
occur|272120004
as a result|394617004
of pressure|279046003|13543005|257893003
on the breast,|76752008|181131000
such as tight-fitting clothing|255365009|272180002|255365009|122467006|272180002|228187009|272180002|228187009|122467006|272180002
or
an over-restrictive bra,|21481007|228165000
although
there
is
sparse evidence|18669006
for this supposition .

Mastitis|45198002
may
occur|272120004
when
the baby|418119000
is
not appropriately
attached|102491009
to the breast|76752008|181131000
while
feeding,|129007004
when
the baby|418119000
has
infrequent feeds|84638005|129007004
or
has
problems|55607006
suckling|288984009
the milk|3718001|119321005|70813002
out of the breast.|76752008|181131000

Experts
are
still
unsure|64957009
why breast milk|226789007
can
cause|23981006|134198009
the breast tissue to|127457009
become
inflamed.

One theory|421379005
is
that
it
may
be
due to the presence|386397008
of cytokines in breast milk.|75777003|226789007

Cytokines|75777003
are
special proteins|67995009|88878007
that
are
used|394850002
by the immune system|116003000
and
are
passed
on
to the baby|418119000
in order to
help
them
resist
infection.

It
may
be
the case|398241000
that
the woman's immune system|224526002|116003000
mistakes
these cytokines|75777003
for a bacterial|409822003
or
viral infection|34014006
and
responds
by inflaming
the breast tissue|127457009
in an attempt to
stop|422117008
the
spread|410677005
of what
the body|279495008|123037004
perceives|81742003
as an infection.

Some women|224526002
(approximately 15%|26175008
in Kvist
et
al.

study|110465008|224699009
)
will
require
antibiotic treatment|255631004|276239002|255631004|416118004
for infection
which
is
usually
caused|23981006|134198009
by bacteria|409822003
from the skin|119325001|39937001|181469002
or
the baby's mouth|418119000|74262004|418119000|123851003|418119000|21082005|418119000|181220002
that entering|417985001
the milk ducts|3718001|343011009|119321005|343011009|70813002|343011009
through skin lesions|95324001
of the nipple|24142002|54468004|265780004
or
through the opening|56116003
of the nipple.|24142002|54468004|265780004

Infection
is
usually
caused|23981006|134198009
by _staphylococcus aureus_.[9]|3092008|406602003

Mastitis|45198002
is
quite common|72906007
among breastfeeding women.|169741004|224526002

The
WHO
estimates|414135002
that
although
incidences
vary
between 2.6%|260306008
and
33%,|264667004
the prevalence globally
is
approximately 10%|26175008
of breastfeeding women.|169741004|224526002

Most mothers|72705000
who
develop
mastitis usually|45198002
do
so|223528007
within the first few weeks|255216001|258705008|232714002|258705008
after delivery.|236973005|118215003

Most breast infections|198108005
occur|272120004
within the first|255216001|232714002
or
second month|81170007|258706009|81170007|259036001|257997001|258706009|257997001|259036001|288495006|258706009|288495006|259036001
after delivery|236973005|118215003
or
at the time|410669006
of weaning.|37328000

However,
in rare cases|84638005|398241000|84638005|413769002|103356009|398241000|103356009|413769002
it
affects|4065008
women|224526002
who
are
not breastfeeding.[11]|169741004

Mastitis|45198002
can
also
develop
after nipple piercing.|24142002|54468004|265780004

In some rare cases Mastitis|84638005|398241000|45198002|84638005|413769002|45198002|103356009|398241000|45198002|103356009|413769002|45198002
can
also
occur|272120004
in men.|339947000

Women|224526002
who
are
breastfeeding|169741004
are
at risk|410519009
for developing mastitis especially|45198002
if
they
have
sore|247348008|279074008|410713007
or
cracked nipples|24142002
or
have
had
mastitis before|45198002
while
breastfeeding|169741004
another baby.|418119000

Also,
the chances
of getting mastitis|45198002
increases|260366006
if women|224526002
use|277889008|419385000
only one position|50607009|421379005|246449006|420295001|421379005|246449006
to breastfeed|169741004
or
wear
a tight-fitting bra,|255365009|228165000|255365009|122467006|228165000|228187009|228165000|228187009|122467006|228165000
which
may
restrict|263856008
milk flow [12]|3718001|119321005|70813002

Women|224526002
with diabetes,|73211009
chronic illness,|27624003
AIDS,|62479008
or
an impaired immune system|260379002|116003000|40226000|116003000
may
be
more susceptible|242762006|131196009
to the development|278923009
of mastitis.[10]|45198002

Complications|116223007
that
may
arise|68727004
from mastitis|45198002
include|55919000
recurrence,|246455001
milk stasis|3718001|19685008|119321005|19685008|70813002|19685008
and
abscess.|128477000

The abscess|128477000
is
the most severe complication|4757001|24484000|116223007|4757001|24484000|263718001
that women|224526002
can
get
from this condition.|260905004

Also,
women|224526002
who
have
had
mastitis|45198002
once
are
likely to|2931005
develop
it again
with a future child|410601007|160499008
or
with the same infant.|262126009|418119000

Recurrence|246455001
appears
especially
in cases|398241000|413769002
of delayed
or
inadequate treatment.|71978007|276239002|71978007|416118004

Milk stasis|3718001|19685008|119321005|19685008|70813002|19685008
is
another complication|116223007|263718001
that
may
arise|68727004
from mastitis|45198002
and
it
occurs|272120004
when
the milk|3718001|119321005|70813002
is
not completely
drained|32712000
from the breast.|76752008|181131000

This causes|134198009
increased|35105006|260366006
pressure|279046003|13543005|257893003
on the ducts|343011009
and
leakage|76676007
of milk|3718001|119321005|70813002
into surrounding breast tissue,|355648006|127457009
which
can
lead|88488004
to pain|22253000
and
inflammation.[13]|257552002

Delayed treatment|276239002|416118004
or
inadequate treatment,|71978007|276239002|71978007|416118004
especially
in mastitis|45198002
related|272151006|262094002
to milk stasis,|3718001|19685008|119321005|19685008|70813002|19685008
may
lead|88488004
to the formation|11798007|255277001
of an abscess|128477000
within the breast tissue.|127457009

An abscess|128477000
is
a collection
of pus|11311000|119323008
that
develops
into the breast|76752008|181131000
which ultimately
requires
surgical drainage.|83578000|307488001|83578000|122462000

The diagnosis|439401001
of mastitis|45198002
and
breast abscess|28432003
can
usually
be
made
based|418836005
on a physical examination.|5880005

The doctor|309343006
will
also
take|419652001
into
account
the signs|72670004
and
symptoms
of the condition.|260905004

However,
if
the doctor|309343006
is
not
sure
whether
the mass|300848003|118538004
is
an abscess|128477000
or
a tumor,|108369006
an ultrasound|359659005
may
be
performed.|398166005

The ultrasound|359659005
provides
a clear image|263707001
of the breast tissue|127457009
and
may
be
helpful
in distinguishing
between simple mastitis|13673007|45198002
and
abscess|128477000
or
in diagnosing|439401001
an abscess|128477000
deep|131197000
in the breast.|76752008|181131000

The test|269814003|272393004
consists
of placing|257557008
an ultrasound probe|359659005|7402007
over the breast.|76752008|181131000

In cases|398241000|413769002
of infectious mastitis,|45198002
cultures|252398009|61594008
may
be
needed|410525008|103325001
in order to
determine
what type|261664005
of organism|410653004
is
causing|23981006
the infection.

Cultures|252398009|61594008
are
helpful
in deciding
the specific type|69658003|261664005
of antibiotics|255631004
that
will
be
used|394850002
in curing
the disease.|64572001

These cultures|252398009|61594008
may
be
taken|419652001
either
from the breast milk|226789007
or
of the material|260769002
aspirated|68052005
from an abscess.|128477000

Mammograms|71651007
or
breast biopsies|122548005
are
normally
performed|398166005
on women|224526002
who
do
not
respond
to treatment|276239002|416118004
or
on non-breastfeeding women.|169741004|224526002

This type of tests|246246002
is
sometimes
ordered
to
exclude|77765009
the possibility
of a rare type|84638005|261664005|103356009|261664005
of breast cancer|254837009|254838004
which
causes|134198009
symptoms
similar
to those
of mastitis.|45198002

Breast cancer|254837009|254838004
may
coincide
with
or
mimic
symptoms
of mastitis.|45198002

Only full resolution|50607009|261015003|420295001|261015003
of symptoms
*
*
and
*
* careful examination|5880005
are
sufficient to|51117008
exclude|77765009
the diagnosis|439401001
of breast cancer.|254837009|254838004

Lifetime risk|30207005
for breast cancer|254837009|254838004
is
significantly
reduced|260400001
for women|224526002
who
were
pregnant|77386006|127362006
and
breastfeeding.|169741004

Mastitis episodes|45198002|272128006
do
not
appear
to
influence
lifetime risk|30207005
of breast cancer.|254837009|254838004

Mastitis|45198002
does
however
cause|23981006|134198009
great difficulties|255509001|371157007|263768009|371157007
in diagnosis|439401001
of breast cancer|254837009|254838004
and
delayed diagnosis|439401001
and
treatment|276239002|416118004
can
result|394617004
in worse outcome.|230993007|394617004|390772001|394617004|231877006|394617004

Breast cancer|254837009|254838004
may
coincide
with mastitis|45198002
or
develop
shortly afterwards.

All suspicious symptoms|22927000
that
do
not
*
*completely
*
*
disappear
within 5 weeks|264706000|258705008|264605009|258705008
must
be
investigated.|116698004

Breast cancer incidence|254837009|254838004
during pregnancy|289908002
and
lactation|169741004|63158009
is
assumed to
be
the same|262126009
as
in controls.|31509003

Course|288524001
and
prognosis|20481000
are
also very similar|260358002
to age matched controls.|424144002|33336008|54776003|424144002|33336008|31509003

However diagnosis|439401001
during lactation|169741004|63158009
is
particularly problematic, often|70232002
leading|236874000
to delayed diagnosis|439401001
and
treatment.|276239002|416118004

Some data
suggests
that noninflammatory breast cancer incidence|260391006|254837009|260391006|254838004
is
increased|35105006|260366006
within a year|258707000|259039008
following|255260001
episodes|272128006
of nonpuerperal mastitis|83620003
and
special care|67995009
is
required
for followup cancer prevention screening.|308273005|15886004|169443000

So far only data|223528007|46053002
from short term observation|103705002
is
available|103328004
and
total risk increase|258755000|30207005|260366006|255619001|30207005|260366006
can
not
be
judged.|11205001

Because of the very short time|260358002|359530003|410669006|260358002|367450005|410669006
between presentation|246105001
of mastitis|45198002
and
breast cancer|254837009|254838004
in this study|110465008|224699009
it
is
considered very unlikely|260358002
that
the inflammation|257552002
had
any substantial role
in carcinogenesis,
rather
it
would
appear
that
some precancerous lesions
may
increase|260366006
the risk|30207005
of inflammation|257552002
(hyperplasia causing duct obstruction,|76197007|23981006|343011009|26036001|76197007|23981006|91726008|26036001
hypersensitivity|421961002|421369008
to cytokines|75777003
or
hormones|87568004
)
or
the lesions
may
have
common predisposing factors.|72906007

A very serious type|260358002|42745003|261664005
of breast cancer|254837009|254838004
called
inflammatory breast cancer|254840009
presents|52101004|246105001
with similar symptoms
as mastitis|45198002
(
both
puerperal|255410009
and
nonpuerperal|255408007
).

It
is
the most aggressive type|4757001|61372001|261664005|4757001|261664005
of breast cancer|254837009|254838004
with the highest mortality rate.|75540009|409651001|371879000|409651001

The inflammatory phenotype|8116006|363778006
of IBC
is
thought to|88952004
be
mostly
caused|23981006|134198009
by invasion|370052007
and
blocking|2899008|112232007
of dermal lymphatics,|119325001|89890002|119325001|83555006|39937001|89890002|39937001|83555006|181469002|89890002|181469002|83555006
however
it
was
recently|6493001
shown
that NF-?B target genes activation|67271001
may
significantly
contribute
to the inflammatory phenotype.|8116006|363778006

Case reports|398241000|229059009|398241000|223458004
show
that inflammatory breast cancer symptoms|254840009
can
flare up following injury|255532002|367409002|255532002|421939007|353734004|367409002|353734004|421939007
or
inflammation making|257552002
it even more likely to|2931005
be
mistaken
for mastitis.|45198002

Symptoms
are
also
known|36692007
to partially
respond
to progesterone|16683002
and
antibiotics,|255631004
reaction|263851003
to other common medications|74964007|72906007|410942007
can
not
be
ruled|10828004
out
at this point.[17][18][19][20][21]

Mastitis|45198002
occurs|272120004
in domestic animals
as
in human beings,|278412004
and
is
especially
a concern
in livestock,
since
milk|3718001|119321005|70813002
from the affected udders|247591002|27528008|248448006|27528008
of livestock
may
enter|417985001
the food supply|255620007|425398004
and
pose
a health risk.|263775005|30207005

It
is
a major condition|255603008|260905004
in some species,|69658003
like dairy cows.|34618005

It
has
a tremendous economic importance
for the dairy industry.

It
is
also
of concern
for public health.|310115006

The same considerations|262126009
apply|410618006|417924000
to mastitis|45198002
in sheep|388254009|255392003
and
goats|125097000|388249000
and
other milk producing females.|74964007|3718001|248152002|74964007|119321005|248152002|74964007|70813002|248152002

It
is
also
of economic importance
in the sow,
but
,
in this species,|69658003
it
is
not
related|272151006|262094002
to public health.|310115006

In other domestic females|74964007|261770009|248152002
(queen,
mare,
etc.
)
,
it
is
more
an individual illness dealt|125676002|39104002|385435006|39104002
with
by veterinary practioners.|53216000
