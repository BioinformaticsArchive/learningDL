*sunburn|23346002

is
a form|246176004
of radiation burn|425656005
that
affects|4065008
living tissue,|85756007
such as skin,|119325001|39937001|181469002
that
results|394617004
from an overexposure
to ultraviolet (UV) radiation,|41355003
commonly
from the sun's rays.|49926000|107315007|49926000|82107009

Usually,
normal symptoms|17621005|258744000
in humans|278412004
and
other animals|74964007|387961004
consist
of red|386713009|371240000
or
reddish skin|119325001|39937001|181469002
that
is
hot|264018002
to the touch,|386476006|52962008|397624008
general fatigue,|60132005|84229001
and
mild dizziness.|255604002|404640003|255604002|399153001

An excess|260378005
of UV radiation|41355003
can
be
life-threatening|224130005
in extreme cases.|12565001|398241000|12565001|413769002

Exposure|71677004|24932003
of the skin|119325001|39937001|181469002
to lesser amounts|263796003|107651007
of UV radiation|41355003
will
often|70232002
produce
a suntan.|238516007

Excessive UV radiation|260378005|41355003
is
the leading cause|236874000|134198009
of primarily non-malignant skin tumors.|372130007

Sunscreen|373498003
is
widely
agreed
to
prevent
sunburn,|23346002
although
some scientists|308027003
argue
that
it
may
not effectively
protect
against malignant melanoma,|372244006|93655004
which
either
is
caused|23981006|134198009
by a different part|263735002|260726005
of the ultraviolet spectrum|415770004
or
is
not
caused|23981006|134198009
by sun exposure|49926000|71677004|49926000|24932003
at all.

Clothing,|272180002
including|55919000
hats,|261368003
is
considered
the preferred skin protection method.|225773000|119325001|260686004|225773000|119325001|272394005|225773000|39937001|260686004|225773000|39937001|272394005|225773000|181469002|260686004|225773000|181469002|272394005

Moderate sun tanning|6736007|49926000|60386007
without burning|90673000|62404004
can
also
prevent
subsequent sunburn,|255260001|23346002
as
it
increases|260366006
the amount|107651007
of melanin,|59094002
a skin photoprotectant pigment|36938005|370172004|46690002
that
is
the skin's natural defense|119325001|510009|39937001|510009|181469002|510009
against overexposure.

Importantly,
both
sunburn|23346002
and
the increase|260366006
in melanin production|59094002
are
triggered|410658008
by direct DNA damage.|255589003|68349007

When
the skin cells' DNA|314819008|24851008
is
damaged|37782003
by UV radiation,|41355003
type I cell-death|246238003|42146005|419620001|246238003|42146005|268923008|246238003|22971001|419620001|246238003|22971001|268923008|258191002|4421005|419620001|258191002|4421005|268923008|258191002|362837007|419620001|258191002|362837007|268923008
is
triggered|410658008
and
the skin|119325001|39937001|181469002
is
replaced.|282089006|370124000

Malignant melanoma|372244006|93655004
may
occur|272120004
as a result|394617004
of indirect DNA damage|255541007|68349007
if
the damage|37782003
is
not properly
repaired.|50826004

Proper repair|298005009|4365001
occurs|272120004
in the majority
of DNA damage.|68349007

The only|50607009|420295001
cure
for sunburn|23346002
is
slow healing,|419443000|298005009|419443000|90910008
although
some skin creams|421628006
can
help
with the symptoms.

Sunburn|23346002
is
caused|23981006|134198009
by UV radiation,|41355003
either
from the sun|49926000
or
from artificial sources,|71967004|260753009
such as welding arcs,|43611006
the lamps|34160005
used|394850002
in sunbeds,
and
ultraviolet germicidal irradiation.|415770004|90339002|359549004|415770004|90339002|108290001

It
is
a reaction|263851003
of the body|279495008|123037004
to the direct DNA damage,|255589003|68349007
which
can
result|394617004
from the excitation
of DNA|24851008
by UV-B light.|41355003

This damage|37782003
is
mainly
the formation|11798007|255277001
of a thymine dimer.|91645009

The damage|37782003
is
recognized
by the body,|279495008|123037004
which then
triggers
several defense mechanisms,|261028005|224992003
including|55919000
DNA repair to|65113001
revert
the damage|37782003
and
increased melanin production to|35105006|59094002|260366006|59094002
prevent
future damage.|37782003

Melanin readily|59094002
absorbs
UV wavelength light,|41355003|246522008
acting
as a photoprotectant.

By preventing|116699007
the disruption|76555007
of bonds
that higher energy photons|75540009|248272003|290006006|371879000|248272003|290006006
can
produce
,
it
inhibits|61511001
both
direct alteration|255589003
of DNA,|24851008
and
generation
of free radicals,|39265005
thus indirect DNA damage.|255541007|68349007

The pain|22253000
may
be
caused|23981006|134198009
by overproduction
of a protein|88878007
called
CXCL5,
which
activates
nerve fibres[6].|88545005

Experiments
with mice|447612001|447482001
found|404684003
that protection
against sunburn|23346002
by chemical sunscreens|441900009|373498003
does
not necessarily
provide
protection
against other damaging effects|74964007|253861007
of UV radiation|41355003
such as enhanced melanoma growth.[7]|372244006

Ultraviolet B (UVB) radiation|41355003
causes|134198009
dangerous sunburns|23346002
and
increases|260366006
the risk|30207005
of two types|420797005|261664005
of skin cancer|372130007
:
basal-cell carcinoma|275265005
and
squamous cell carcinoma.[1][2]|402815007

Some exposure|71677004|24932003
to sunlight|49926000
is
not only harmless
but
positively necessary
to health.|263775005

Humans|278412004
need|410525008|103325001
vitamin D|71516007|30178006
;
most
is
synthesised
in the body|279495008|123037004
by exposure|71677004|24932003
of the skin|119325001|39937001|181469002
to sunlight,|49926000
with some
from the diet.|41829006

People|125676002
with darker skins|255419005|39937001
need|410525008|103325001
more
sunlight|49926000
to
maintain|385630006
vitamin D levels.|71516007|258395000|30178006|258395000

The widespread concern about over-exposure|85333001|21481007|71677004|85333001|21481007|24932003
to the sun causing cancer|49926000|23981006|363346000|49926000|23981006|372087000
has
led|88488004|236874000
some people to|125676002
go
too far|46053002
in avoiding exposure|71677004|24932003
and
using|260676000
sunscreen|373498003
;
this
can
lead|88488004
to vitamin D deficiency|34713006
and
the condition|260905004
of rickets|41345002
due to this deficiency,|260372006|248325000
particularly
in children,|410601007|160499008
and
particularly
in climates
with less sunshine.|276139006|49926000|263796003|49926000

Cases|398241000|413769002
of rickets|41345002
are
,
indeed,
on the increase.|260366006

Twenty
to thirty minutes|258701004|255507004|356624006
of unimpeded exposure|71677004|24932003
to the sun two|49926000|420797005
to three|421291004
times a week|258705008|259038000
are
recommended.[8]

The statement _sunburn|23346002
causes|134198009
skin cancer_|372130007
is
considered accurate|263656005
when
it
refers|439980006
to
either
basal-cell carcinoma,|275265005
the mildest form|255604002|246176004
of cancer,|363346000|372087000
or
squamous cell carcinoma.|402815007

However,
this
may
be
misleading
when
it
comes
to malignant melanoma|372244006|93655004
(
see|281004000
picture|257444003|257445002

_[citation

The statistical correlation
between sunburn|23346002
and
melanoma|372244006
is
assumed to
be
due to a common cause ? UV radiation.|72906007|134198009|41355003

Instead,
this correlation
may
be
generated
via different mechanisms.|263735002|257544000

Direct DNA damage|255589003|68349007
is
ascribed
by many medical doctors|309343006
to a change|243326001|263703002
in behaviour|844005
of the sunscreen user|373498003
due to a false sense|64100000|106148006
of security
afforded
by the sunscreen.|373498003

While
some researchers
believe
that
these confounding factors
can
be
controlled|31509003
for effectively,
[9] others
believe
there to
be
insufficient correction|71978007|423437008
for light-skinned individuals|56242006|39937001|125676002|56242006|39937001|385435006|371268001|39937001|125676002|371268001|39937001|385435006
and
indirect DNA damage._[clarification|255541007|68349007
needed|410525008|103325001
_]

The use|277889008|419385000
of sunscreen|373498003
is
known to|36692007
prevent
the direct DNA damage|255589003|68349007
that
causes|134198009
sunburn|23346002
and
the two most common forms|420797005|72906007|246176004
of skin cancer,|372130007
basal-cell carcinoma|275265005
and
squamous cell carcinoma.|402815007

However,
if
sunscreen|373498003
penetrates|53568006
into the skin,|119325001|39937001|181469002
it
promotes
indirect DNA damage,|255541007|68349007
which
causes|134198009
the most lethal form|4757001|246176004
of skin cancer,|372130007
malignant melanoma.|372244006|93655004

This form|246176004
of skin cancer|372130007
is
rare,|84638005|103356009
but
it
causes|134198009
75%
of all skin cancer-related deaths.|372130007|272151006|419620001|372130007|272151006|268923008|372130007|262094002|419620001|372130007|262094002|268923008

Increased risk|35105006|30207005|260366006|30207005
of malignant melanoma|372244006|93655004
in sunscreen users|373498003
has
been
the subject
of many epidemiological studies.[3][4][16][17][18][19][20]|110465008|224699009

Because of variations|40885006
in the intensity|103370009
of UV radiation passing|41355003
through the atmosphere,|304607008
the risk|30207005
of sunburn increases|23346002|260366006
with proximity
to the tropic latitudes,
located
between 23.5?|264657009
north
and
south latitude.

All else
being
equal|9726003
(
e.g.
,
cloud cover,|81858005
ozone layer,|40057008
terrain,
etc.
)
,
over the course|288524001
of a full year,|261015003|258707000|261015003|259039008
each location|246267002
within the tropic
or
polar regions|410673009
receives
approximately|26175008
the same amount|262126009|107651007
of UV radiation.|41355003

In the temperate zones
between 23.5?|264657009
and
66.5?,
UV radiation|41355003
varies
by latitude.

The higher|75540009|371879000
the latitude,
the lower|261122009
the intensity|103370009
of the UV rays.|41355003

On a minute-|258701004|255507004|286549009|356624006
by-minute basis,|258701004|258701004|418836005|255507004|255507004|418836005|286549009|286549009|418836005|356624006|356624006|418836005
the amount|107651007
of UV radiation|41355003
is
dependent|371154000
on the angle|1483009
of the sun.|49926000

This
is
easily|36203004
determined
by the height ratio|118586006
of any object|260787004
to the size|277049003
of its shadow.|39321000

The greatest risk|4757001|30207005
is
at solar noon,|49926000|71997007
when
shadows|39321000
are
at their minimum|255605001|255604002
and
the sun's radiation|49926000|30821001|49926000|82107009|49926000|108290001
passes
more directly|242762006
through the atmosphere.|304607008

Regardless of one's latitude|421379005
(
assuming
no other variables|74964007|255372005
)
,
equal shadow lengths mean equal amounts|9726003|39321000|410668003|255586005|107651007
of UV radiation.|41355003

Sunburn|23346002
can
also
be
caused|23981006|134198009
by pharmaceutical products|421967003
that
sensitize
some users
to UV radiation.|41355003

Certain antibiotics,|17162000|255631004
oral contraceptives,|423938009
and
tranquillizers|45604009
have
this effect.|253861007

In general, people|60132005|125676002
with fair hair|386045008|119326000
and/or
freckles|72298008
have
a greater risk|263768009|30207005
of sunburn|23346002
than others|74964007
because of their lighter skin tone.[22]|75926004|119325001|223628004|75926004|119325001|258691001|75926004|39937001|223628004|75926004|39937001|258691001|75926004|181469002|223628004|75926004|181469002|258691001

In recent years,|6493001|258707000
the incidence
and
severity|272141005
of sunburn|23346002
has
increased|35105006|260366006
worldwide,
especially
in the southern hemisphere,
because of damage|37782003
to the ozone layer.|40057008

Ozone depletion|40057008|69251000
and
the seasonal ozone hole|21864008|40057008
have
led|88488004|236874000
to dangerously high levels|75540009|258395000|371879000|258395000
of UV radiation.|41355003

Incidence
of skin cancer|372130007
in Queensland,|223778006
Australia|223621005
had
risen
to 75 percent|118582008
among those over 64 years|21481007|258707000
of age|424144002
by about 1990,
due,|42752001
it
is
presumed,
to thinning|29143009
of the ozone layer.|40057008

It
was
pointed
out
by Garland
et
al.

that
the melanoma rate|372244006
in Queensland|223778006
had
taken|419652001
a steep rise
before the rest|258157001
of Australia|223621005
experienced
the same increase|262126009|260366006
of melanoma numbers.|372244006|410680006|372244006|410681005

They
blamed
the vigorous promotion
of sunscreen,|373498003
which
was
first|255216001|232714002
done
in Queensland,|223778006
while
sunscreen|373498003
use|277889008|419385000
was
encouraged
in the rest|258157001
of Australia|223621005
some time later.|410669006

An effect|253861007
that
would
stem
from the ozone depletion|40057008|69251000
could
not
differ
from territory|398070004
to territory|398070004
within Australia,|223621005
but
sunscreen endorsement programs|373498003
could.

Another study|110465008|224699009
from Norway|223673006
points
out
that there
had
been
no change|243326001|263703002
in the ozone layer|40057008
during the period 1957|259037005
to 1984,
yet
the yearly incidence|53281000
of melanoma|372244006
in Norway|223673006
had
increased|35105006|260366006
by 350%
for men|339947000
and
by 440%
for women.|224526002

They
concluded
that
in Norway "ozone depletion|223673006|40057008|69251000
is
not
the cause|134198009
of the increase|260366006
in skin cancers".[25]|372130007

Suntans,|238516007
which naturally
develop
in some individuals|125676002|385435006
as a protective mechanism|257544000
against the sun,|49926000
are
viewed|246516004
by many|260396001
in the Western world
as desirable.

This
has
led|88488004|236874000
to increased exposure|35105006|71677004|35105006|24932003|260366006|71677004|260366006|24932003
to UV radiation|41355003
from both
the natural sun|510009|49926000
and
solaria.

Typically there
is
initial redness|884001|386713009|884001|371240000|232714002|386713009|232714002|371240000
(erythema,|444827008
followed|367409002
by varying degrees|246173007
of pain,|22253000
proportional|8212001
in severity|272141005
to both
the duration|103335007
and
intensity|103370009
of exposure.|71677004|24932003

Other symptoms|74964007
are
edema,|423666004
itching|424492005
,
peeling skin,|271767006
rash,|271807003
nausea,|422587007
fever,|386661006
and
syncope.|271594007

Also,
a small amount|255507004|107651007
of heat|88999006
is
given|419582001
off
from the burn,|125666000
caused|23981006|134198009
by the concentration|82742001
of blood|87612001|119273009
in the healing process,|298005009|415178003|90910008|415178003
giving|419582001
a warm feeling|285854004
to the affected area.|247591002|42798000|248448006|42798000

Sunburns|23346002
may
be
first-|255216001|232714002
or
second-degree burns.|403191005

One|421379005
should
immediately|49499008
speak|87335007|286370002
to a dermatologist|18803008
if
one|421379005
develops
a skin lesion|95324001
that
has
an asymmetrical form,|4128009|246176004
has
darker edges|255419005|57183005
than center,|26216008
changes|243326001|263703002
color,|263714004
or
becomes
larger|255509001|263768009
than 1/4 inch|264617006
(6 mm
).

Melanoma|372244006

Minor sunburns typically|410599005|23346002|255606000|23346002
cause|23981006|134198009
nothing more|242762006
than slight redness|255510006|386713009|255510006|371240000|255604002|386713009|255604002|371240000
and
tenderness|247348008
to the affected areas.|247591002|42798000|248448006|42798000

In more serious cases,|242762006|42745003|398241000|242762006|42745003|413769002
blistering|408764000|247464001
can
occur.|272120004

Extreme sunburns|12565001|23346002
can
be
painful|22253000
to the point
of debilitation
and
may
require
hospital care.|285201006

Sunburn|23346002
can
occur|272120004
in less|276139006|263796003
than 15 minutes,|258701004|255507004|356624006
and
in seconds|257997001
when
exposed|24932003
to non-shielded welding arcs|30115002|43611006
or
other sources|74964007|260753009
of intense ultraviolet light.|103370009|41355003

Nevertheless,
the inflicted harm
is
often|70232002
not immediately obvious.|49499008

After the exposure,|71677004|24932003
skin|119325001|39937001|181469002
may
turn|282987006
red|386713009|371240000
in
as
little|281411007|255507004
as 30 minutes|259030007
but
most often|4757001|70232002
takes|419652001
2
to 6 hours.|123033000

Pain|22253000
is
usually most extreme 6|12565001
to 48 hours|255249005
after exposure.|71677004|24932003

The burn|125666000
continues|255238004
to
develop
for 24
to 72 hours,|123028004
occasionally
followed|367409002
by peeling skin|271767006
in 3|260313008
to 8 days.|258703001

Some peeling|257890000|51979000
and
itching|424492005
may
continue|255238004
for several weeks.|261028005|258705008

Long-term low-intensity exposure|62482003|103370009|71677004|62482003|103370009|24932003|371880002|103370009|71677004|371880002|103370009|24932003
to sunlight|49926000
is
known to|36692007
cause|23981006|134198009
significant ageing|386134007|248280005
of the skin|119325001|39937001|181469002
;
other health effects|74964007|263775005|253861007
are
not accurately
known.|36692007

A particular example
with very noticeable ageing|260358002|248280005
is
that
of a 69-year-old truck driver|264698002|258707000|70753007|12247004|236320001|264698002|259039008|70753007|12247004|236320001
in Chicago,
USA|223688001
who
drove|129060000|247750002
in the city|284560003
for 28 years.|258707000

A photograph|257444003
of his face[27][28]|89545001|302549007
shows
a great deal|255509001|263768009
of ageing|248280005
on the left side,|7771000
where
he
was
exposed|24932003
to
sunlight|49926000
all day,|261675009|258703001|261675009|259032004
while
the right side|24028007
has
the "taut,
unblemished face|89545001|302549007
of an apparently much younger man".|84422007|248153007|84422007|339947000|84422007|278412004

Window glass|224755008|32039001|385673002|32039001
does
not absorb UVA,
which
can
penetrate|53568006
the epidermis|55988001
and
upper layers|261183002
of dermis.|53534000

Chronic UVA exposure|90734009|71677004|90734009|24932003
can
cause|23981006|134198009
photoageing|43982006
:
thickening|263899003
of the epidermis|55988001
and
stratum corneum|20281003
and
destruction|64597002
of elastic fibers|35798006
;
it
can
cause|23981006|134198009
DNA mutations|24851008|55446002
and
toxicity
which
can
lead|88488004
to cancer,|363346000|372087000
although
less carcinogenic|276139006|88376000|276139006|68453008|263796003|88376000|263796003|68453008
than UVB.

One|421379005
of the most effective ways to|4757001|255403003|4757001|254648000
prevent
sunburn|23346002
is
to
reduce|260400001
the amount|107651007
of UV radiation|41355003
reaching|282679008
the skin.|119325001|39937001|181469002

The strength|260404005
of sunlight|49926000
is
published
in many locations|246267002
as a UV index.|41355003|419205000|426342006|419205000

The World Health Organization|263775005|21139007
recommends
to
limit|255469002
time|410669006
in the midday sun|71997007|49926000
(
between 10
a.m.|258311008

and
4 p.m.|260308009
)
,
to
watch
the UV index,|41355003|419205000|426342006|419205000
to
seek
shade,
to
wear
protective clothing|272180002
and
a wide-brim hat,|90522003|261368003
and
to
use|277889008|419385000
sunscreen.|373498003

Sunlight|49926000
is
generally strongest|260404005
when
the sun|49926000
is
close|29179001
to the highest point|75540009|371879000
in the sky.|52773007

Due to time zones|410669006
and
daylight
saving
time,|410669006
this
is
not necessarily
at 12 p.m.,
but
often|70232002
one|421379005
to two hours later.|420797005|258702006

Commercial preparations|225106003
are
available|103328004
that block UV light,|26036001|41355003|112232007|41355003
known|36692007
as sunscreens|373498003
or
sunblocks.|373498003

They
have
a sunburn protection factor|23346002
(SPF rating,|27350008
based|418836005
on the sunblock's ability to|373498003|371150009
suppress|245780008
sunburn|23346002
:
The higher|75540009|371879000
the SPF|27350008
rating
the lower|261122009
the amount|107651007
of direct DNA damage.|255589003|68349007

A sunscreen|373498003
rated
as SPF 10 blocks 90%|27350008|26036001|264705001|27350008|26036001|264703008
of the sunburn-causing UVB radiation|23346002|23981006|30821001|23346002|23981006|82107009|23346002|23981006|108290001
;
an SPF20-rated sunscreen|373498003
blocks|26036001
95%_[citation
needed|410525008|103325001
_].

Modern sunscreens|373498003
contain|42504009
filters|116250002
for UVA radiation|30821001|82107009|108290001
as well as
UVB.

The stated protection factors|398070004
are
correct only if 2 ?l
of sunscreen|373498003
is
applied|410618006
per square cm|56924007
of exposed skin.|24932003|119325001|24932003|39937001|24932003|181469002

This translates
into about 28 ml|259035002
(1 oz) to|260305007|258692008
cover|255334000
the whole body|261188006
of an adult male,|133936004|248153007
which
is
much more|242762006|4757001
than many people|125676002
use|277889008|419385000
in practice.|52101004|18720000

Although
UVA radiation|30821001|82107009|108290001
does
not
cause|23981006|134198009
sunburn,|23346002
it
does
contribute
to skin aging|26065007
and
an increased risk|35105006|30207005|260366006|30207005
of skin cancer.|372130007

Many sunscreens|260396001|373498003
provide
broad-spectrum protection,|90522003
meaning|255586005
that
they
protect
against
both
UVA
and
UVB radiation.|30821001|82107009|108290001

Research
has
shown
that
the best protection
is
achieved
by application 15|410618006
to 30 minutes|259030007
before exposure,|71677004|24932003
followed|367409002
by one reapplication 15|421379005
to 30 minutes|259030007
after exposure|71677004|24932003
begins.|255395001

Further reapplication|46053002
is
necessary only
after activities|257733005
such as swimming,|20461001
sweating|161857006
,
and
rubbing.

This
varies
based|418836005
on the indications|410666004
and
protection
shown
on the label ?
from
as
little|281411007|255507004
as 80 minutes|258701004|255507004|356624006
in water|11713004|119318008
to a few hours,|57176003|258702006
depending
on the product
selected.

When
one|421379005
is
exposed|24932003
to any artificial source|71967004|260753009
of occupational UV,|87923000|41355003|87923000|426342006
special protective clothing|67995009|272180002
(
for example,
welding|43611006
helmets/shields|285695004|30115002
)
should
be
worn.

There
is
also
evidence|18669006
that common foods|72906007|255620007
may
have
some protective ability|371150009
against sunburn|23346002
if
taken|419652001
for a period|259037005
before the exposure.|71677004|24932003

Beta-carotene|103068006
and
lycopene,|414625009
chemicals|441900009
found|404684003
in tomatoes|256327008|55242003
and
other fruit,|74964007|72511004
have
been
found|404684003
to
increase|260366006
the skin's ability to|119325001|371150009|39937001|371150009|181469002|371150009
resist
the effects|253861007
of UV light.|41355003

In a 2007 study,|110465008|224699009
after
about 10?12 weeks|258705008
of eating tomato-derived products,|48263008|256327008|48263008|55242003

observed
in volunteers.|160772005

Ketchup
and
tomato puree|227274006
are
both

Dark chocolate|255419005|102262009
rich|224166006
in flavonoids|424943007
has
also
been
found|404684003
to
have
a similar effect|253861007
if
eaten|48263008
for long periods|255511005|259037005
before exposure.|71677004|24932003

The eyes|81745001
are
also sensitive to|83185005

Several dietary antioxidants,|261028005|41829006
including|55919000
essential vitamins,|34325006|87708000
have
been

Supplementation
with Vitamin C|46123006
and
Vitamin E|37237003
was
shown
in one|421379005
study|110465008|224699009
to
reduce|260400001
the amount|107651007

after a controlled amount|31509003|107651007
of UV exposure.|41355003|71677004|41355003|24932003|426342006|71677004|426342006|24932003

A review
of scientific literature
through 2007
found|404684003
that beta carotene|103068006
(Vitamin A|82622003
)
supplementation
had
a protective effect|253861007
against sunburn,|23346002
but
that
the effects|253861007
were
only evident|50607009|18669006|420295001|18669006
in the long-term,
with studies|110465008|224699009
of supplementation
for periods less|259037005
than 10 weeks|258705008
in duration failing to|103335007
show
any effects.|253861007

Lutein,|422048002

immunosuppression.[38]|86553008|264670000|38013005|264670000

Sunburn|23346002
increases|260366006
the metabolic demands
on the body,|279495008|123037004
increasing|260369004
the needs|410525008|103325001

to
take|419652001
precautions to
prevent
future burns.|125666000
