*Medulloblastoma|443333004
*
*
is
a highly malignant primary brain tumor|75540009|93727008
that
originates
in the cerebellum|113305005|180924008
or
posterior fossa.|255551008|77223002|255551008|388839005

Previously,
medulloblastomas|443333004
were
thought|88952004
to
represent
a subset
of primitive neuroectodermal tumor (PNET)|39781001
of the posterior fossa.|255551008|77223002|255551008|388839005

However,
gene expression profiling|89551006
has
shown
that medulloblastomas|443333004
have
a distinct molecular profile|290005005
and
are
distinct
from other PNET tumors.|74964007|39781001|108369006

Tumors|108369006
that
originate
in the cerebellum|113305005|180924008
are
referred|439980006
to
as
infratentorial|258330008
because
they
occur|272120004
below the tentorium,|4566004|244428008
a thick membrane|246703001|83097008
that
separates|13184001|263869007
the cerebral hemispheres|372073000
of the brain|12738006|258335003
from the cerebellum.|113305005|180924008

Another term
for
*
*medulloblastoma|443333004
*
*
is
infratentorial primitive neuroectodermal tumor (PNET).|258330008|258330008|39781001

Medulloblastoma|443333004
is
the most common PNET originating|4757001|72906007|39781001
in the brain.[1]|12738006|258335003

All PNET tumors|39781001|108369006
of the brain|12738006|258335003
are
invasive|10179008
and
rapidly growing tumors|418694008|108369006
that,
unlike most brain tumors,|126952004
spread|410677005
through the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)|65216001
and
frequently|70232002
metastasize
to different locations|263735002|246267002
in the brain|12738006|258335003
and
spine.|421060004|44300000|243930007

It
was
originally
believed
that there
were
six subtypes,|422218008|260837004
based|418836005
on different tumors' molecular fingerprints|263735002|108369006|290005005
(
each
behaves
very differently,|260358002
depending
on the child|410601007|160499008
and
the tumor's genetics,|108369006
malignancy,|363346000|372087000
metastasis,|128462008
and
other characteristics|74964007
)
,
however,
due to better understanding|3442003|66216009
of
both
tumor genetic expression|108369006|3950001|10012005|108369006|255395001|10012005
and
the protein-coding genes|88878007|67271001
(
the "exome"
)
of medulloblastoma,|443333004
as of October 2012,
there
are
believed
to
be
four,|421534005
according to a Harvard Medical School|74188005|257698009
and
Boston Children's Hospital pediatric oncology research|82242000|418002000

Medulloblastomas|443333004
affect|4065008
just
under 2 people|260306008|125676002
per million
per year,|258707000|259039008
and
affect|4065008
children 10 times more|410601007|410669006|410601007|417929005|160499008|410669006|160499008|417929005
than adults.|133936004

Medulloblastoma|443333004
is
the most common malignant brain tumor,|4757001|72906007|428061005|4757001|72906007|93727008
comprising
14.5%
of newly diagnosed cases.|439401001|398241000|439401001|413769002

In adults,|133936004
medulloblastoma|443333004
is
rare,|84638005|103356009
comprising
fewer|57176003
than 2%|260306008
of CNS malignancies.[5]|372062007

The incidence
of childhood medulloblastoma|68433009|443333004
is
higher|75540009|371879000
in males|248153007
(62%
)
than females|248152002
(38%|264670000
)
,
a feature
which
is
not
seen
in adults.|133936004

Medulloblastoma|443333004
and
other PNET tumors|74964007|39781001|108369006
are
more prevalent|242762006
in younger children|74489007
than older children.|31114009

40%|259031006
of medulloblastoma patients|443333004|116154003
are
diagnosed|439401001
before the age|424144002
of 5,|264706000|264605009
31%|264664006
are
between the ages|424144002
of 5
and
9,
18.3%
are
between the ages|424144002
of 10
and
14,
and
12.7%
are
between the ages|424144002
of 15
and
19.[7]

Medulloblastomas usually|443333004
form|246176004
in the vicinity
of the fourth ventricle,|35918002|180932000
between the brainstem|15926001|180925009
and
the cerebellum.|113305005|180924008

Tumors|108369006
with similar appearance|386548000|255412001
and
characteristics
originate
in other parts|74964007|260726005
of the brain,|12738006|258335003
but
they
are
not identical|20323000
to medulloblastoma.[8]|443333004

Although
it
is
thought|88952004
that medulloblastomas|443333004
originate
from immature|1090009
or
embryonal cells|57991002|4421005
at their earliest stage|264499004|21191007|264499004|371508000|264499004|261612004
of development,|278923009
the exact cell|4421005|362837007
of origin,|255395001
or
"medulloblast"|20367003
has
yet to
be
identified._[citation|7882003
needed|410525008|103325001

It
is
currently|15240007
thought|88952004
that medulloblastoma|443333004
arises|68727004
from cerebellar stem cells|113305005|419758009
that
have
been
prevented|116699007
from dividing|422033008
and
differentiating|263933003
into their normal cell types.|4421005|261664005|118957004|261664005|17621005|4421005|17621005|246238003|258744000|4421005|258744000|246238003

This accounts
from the varying histologic variants|67151002|40885006
seen
on biopsy.|86273004

Both
perivascular pseudorosette|255564009
and
Homer-Wright rosette|25177008|373682001|12170000
pseudorosettes
formation|11798007|255277001
are
highly characteristic|75540009
of medulloblastoma|443333004
and
is
seen
in
up to half
of the cases.|398241000|413769002

Homer-Wright rosettes|25177008|373682001|12170000
are
pseudorosettes
consisting
of tumor cells|252987004
surrounding|355648006
a fibrillar area.|88921000|42798000

Also,
the classic rosette|255301002|12170000|255333006|12170000
with tumor cells|252987004
around a central lumen|26216008|113342003|26216008|342806003|26216008|398252006
can
be
seen.[10]

Recent integrated genomic studies|6493001|18470003|110465008|6493001|18470003|224699009
have
revealed|263857004
that medulloblastoma|443333004
is
composed
of four distinct molecular|421534005|290005005
and
clinical variants|58147004|40885006
termed
WNT,
SHH,
Group 3|258374005
and
Group 4.|258381003

Of these subgroups WNT patients|116154003
have
an excellent prognosis|425405005|20481000
and
Group 3|258374005
have
a dismal prognosis.|20481000

There also
exists
subgroup specific alternative splicing|69658003|85030005
which further|46053002
confirms|59156000
the existence
of distinct subgroups
and
highlights
the transcriptional heterogeneity|10589004
between subgroups.

Medulloblastomas|443333004
are
also
seen
in Gorlin syndrome|69408002|38215007
as well as
Turcot syndrome.|61665008

Recurrent mutations|255227004|55446002
in the genes CTNNB1,|67271001
PTCH1,
MLL2,
SMARCA4,
DDX3X,
CTDNEP1,
KDM6A
and
TBR1
were
identified|7882003
in individuals|125676002|385435006
with medulloblastoma.[13]|443333004

Symptoms
are
mainly
due to secondary increased intracranial pressure|2603003|271719001|81170007|271719001
due to blockage
of the fourth ventricle|35918002|180932000
and
are
usually
present|52101004|246105001
for 1|260305007
to 5 months|264706000|258706009|264605009|258706009
before diagnosis|439401001
is
made.

The child typically|410601007|160499008
becomes
listless,|20602000
with repeated episodes|27582007|272128006
of vomiting,|249497008
and
a morning headache,|162310002
which
may
lead|88488004
to a misdiagnosis
of gastrointestinal disease|119292006
or
migraine.|37796009

Soon
after
,
the child|410601007|160499008
will
develop
a stumbling gait,|82612009
frequent falls,|70232002|1912002
diplopia,|24982008
papilledema,|423341008
and
sixth cranial nerve palsy.|398963001

Positional dizziness|246449006|404640003|246449006|399153001
and
nystagmus|563001
are
also frequent|70232002
and
facial sensory loss|89545001|33653009
or
motor weakness|13791008|260407003
may
be
present.|52101004|246105001

Decerebrate attacks|216299002
appear
late|260383002
in the disease.|64572001

Extraneural metastases|128462008
to the rest|258157001
of the body|279495008|123037004
is
rare,|84638005|103356009
but
usually only
after
craniotomy.|25353009

The tumor|108369006
is
distinctive
on T1
and
T2-weighted MRI|27113001|113091000|272102008|113091000|39857003|113091000
with heterogeneous enhancement|418393006
and
typical location|246267002
adjacent|18769003
to
and
extension|255536004
into the fourth ventricle.|35918002|180932000

Histologically,|67151002
the tumor|108369006
is
solid, pink-gray|35702001|371243003|229029004|35702001|371243003|371253002|78910004|371243003|229029004|78910004|371243003|371253002|421378002|371243003|229029004|421378002|371243003|371253002
in color,|263714004
and
is
well|20572008
circumscribed.|355648006

The tumor|108369006
is
very cellular,|260358002|4421005
many mitoses,|7041004
little cytoplasm,
and
has
the tendency to
form|246176004
clusters
and
rosettes.|12170000

Correct diagnosis|439401001
of medulloblastoma|443333004
may
require
ruling out atypical teratoid rhabdoid tumor (ATRT)[14]|10828004|128792003

Treatment|276239002|416118004
begins|255395001
with maximal resection|56851009|118292001|56851009|128303001|398303009|118292001|398303009|128303001
of the tumor.|108369006

The addition|260364009
of radiation|30821001|82107009|108290001
to the entire neuraxis|255503000|21483005|260232004|21483005
and
chemotherapy|416608005|367336001
may
increase|260366006
the disease-free survival.|64572001|37837009

This combination|89780004
may
permit|958006
a 5 year survival|264706000|258707000|264706000|259039008|264605009|258707000|264605009|259039008
in more|242762006
than 80%
of cases.|398241000|413769002

The presence|386397008
of desmoplastic features|263756000
such as connective tissue formation|181769001|11798007|181769001|255277001
offers|410527000
a better prognosis.|3442003|20481000

Prognosis|20481000
is
worse|230993007|390772001|231877006
if
the child|410601007|160499008
is
less
than 3 years old,|260313008|258707000|70753007
there
is
an inadequate degree|71978007|258395000|71978007|246173007
of resection,|118292001|128303001
or
if there
is
any CSF,
spinal,
supratentorial|258329003
or
systemic spread.|31099001|410677005

Dementia|12348006|52448006
post radiotherapy|288563008|419815003|288563008|108290001
and
chemotherapy|416608005|367336001
is
a common outcome appearing two|72906007|394617004|420797005
to four years|421534005|258707000
following|255260001
treatment.|276239002|416118004

Increased intracranial pressure|271719001
may
be
controlled|31509003
with corticosteroids|79440004
or
a ventriculoperitoneal shunt.|47020004|257354000

Chemotherapy|416608005|367336001
is
now
an important part|260726005
of treatment|276239002|416118004
for all patients|116154003
with medulloblastoma.|443333004

It
can
significantly
reduce|260400001
risk|30207005
of recurrence|246455001
(
which
is
typically fatal|399166001
).

There
are
a couple
of different chemotheraputic regimens|263735002
for medulloblastoma,|443333004
but
most
involve|248448006
a combination|89780004
of lomustine,|387227009
cisplatin,|387318005
carboplatin,|386905002
vincristine|387126006
or
cyclophosphamide.|387420009

In younger patients|84422007|116154003
(less
than 3?4 years|260279004|258707000
of age|424144002
)
,
chemotherapy|416608005|367336001
can
delay
,
or
in some cases possibly even|398241000|60022001|413769002|60022001
eliminate
,
the need|410525008|103325001
for radiotherapy.[15]|419815003|108290001

Currently|15240007
