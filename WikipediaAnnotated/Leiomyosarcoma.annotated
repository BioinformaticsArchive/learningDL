(Gr.

"smooth muscle connective tissue tumor"|75109009|181769001|122447002|126598008
)
,
aka LMS,
is
a malignant cancer|21594007|363346000|21594007|372087000
of smooth muscle.|122447002

(
When
such a neoplasm|108369006
is
benign,|30807003
it
is
a leiomyoma.|95315005
)

Leiomyosarcoma|443719001
is
a relatively rare form|84638005|246176004|103356009|246176004
of cancer,|363346000|372087000
and
accounts
for
between 5?10%|264706000|264605009
of soft tissue sarcomas,|424952003
which
are
in themselves relatively rare.|84638005|103356009

Leiomyosarcomas|443719001
can
be
very unpredictable.|260358002

They
can
remain
dormant
for long periods|255511005|259037005
of time|410669006
and
recur|246455001
after years.|258707000

It
is
a resistant cancer,|30714006|363346000|30714006|372087000
meaning|255586005
generally
not very responsive|422768004|260358002
to chemotherapy|416608005|367336001
or
radiation.|30821001|82107009|108290001

The best outcomes|394617004
occur|272120004
when
it
can
be
removed|127485006
surgically|83578000
with wide margins early,|90522003|112233002|264499004|90522003|82868003|264499004|90522003|372249001|264499004
while
small|255507004
and
still
in situ.[2]

Smooth muscle cells make up|122447002|4421005|255532002|122447002|4421005|353734004
the involuntary muscles,|122447002
which
are
found|404684003
in most parts|260726005
of the body,|279495008|123037004
including|55919000
the uterus,|35039007|181452004
stomach|69695003|181246003
and
intestines,|261093006
the walls|224727009
of all blood vessels,|59820001
and
the skin.|119325001|39937001|181469002

It
is
therefore possible|371930009|60022001
for leiomyosarcomas to|443719001
appear
at any site|10546003
in the body|279495008|123037004
(
including|55919000
the breasts|76752008
)
;
they
are
most commonly|4757001
found|404684003
in the uterus,|35039007|181452004
[3] stomach,|260313008|69695003|260313008|181246003
small intestine|264196002|181250005
and
retroperitoneum.[4]|260642009

Uterine leiomyosarcomas|447389009
come
from the smooth muscle|122447002
in the muscle layer|86915006
of the uterus.|35039007|181452004

Cutaneous leiomyosarcomas|254771006
derive
from the pilo-erector muscles|91727004
in the skin.|119325001|39937001|181469002

Gastrointestinal leiomyosarcomas|443719001
might
come
from smooth muscle|122447002
in the GI tract|122865005
or
,
alternatively,
also
from a blood vessel.|59820001|361097006

At most other primary sites?retroperitoneal extremity|4757001|246312001|260642009|66019005
(
in the abdomen,|277112006|52731004|302553009
behind the intestines|261093006
)
,
truncal,|22943007|262225004
abdominal organs,|272631008
etc.?leiomyosarcomas|443719001
appear
to
grow
from the muscle layer|86915006
of a blood vessel|59820001|361097006
(
the tunica media.|61695000

Thus
a leiomyosarcoma|443719001
can
have
a primary site|246312001
of origin anywhere|255395001
in the body|279495008|123037004
where there
is
a blood vessel.[2]|59820001|361097006

Grossly,
the tumors|108369006
are
usually hemorrhagic|255345002
and
soft|37378003
and
microscopically
marked|46998006
by pleomorphism,|4916000
abundant
(15-30
per 10 high power fields|75540009|33300005|255798002|371879000|33300005|255798002
)
abnormal mitotic figures,|263654008
and
coagulative tumor cell necrosis.|32224006|252987004

Surgery,|83578000
with
as
wide|90522003
a margin|112233002|82868003|372249001
of removal|118292001|128303001
as possible,|371930009|60022001
has
generally
been
the most effective|4757001|255403003|4757001|254648000
and
preferred way to|225773000
attack|217315002|216299002
LMS.

If surgical margins|82868003
are
narrow|18043004|25659002|134223000
or
not
clear|263707001
of tumor,|108369006
however,
or
in some situations
where tumor cells|252987004
were
left|7771000
behind,
chemotherapy|416608005|367336001
or
radiation|30821001|82107009|108290001
has
been
shown
to
give|419582001
a clear survival benefit.|263707001

While
LMS
tends
to
be
resistant|30714006
to radiation|30821001|82107009|108290001
and
chemotherapy,|416608005|367336001
each case|398241000
is
different|263735002
and
results|394617004
can
vary
widely.

Complementary methods|260686004|272394005
(
such as over-the-counter supplements|80288002|373453009
)
should
always
be
discussed
with one's doctor|421379005|309343006
(s|288495006
)
;
some supplements|373453009
can
actually hinder treatments|276239002
like chemotherapy.|416608005|367336001

One form|421379005|246176004
of adjuvant medicinal treatment|427067006|276239002|427067006|416118004
is
a prescription oral tablet|260885003|421026006
called
Methotrexate,|387381009
a chemotherapy|416608005|367336001
in itself,
and
has
shown
positive results,|258758003|394617004|10828004|394617004
including|55919000
longer periods|255511005|259037005
of nonoccurrence.

Many specialists|260396001|309395003
have
recorded
promising results|394617004
when
the medicine|410942007
is
used|394850002
in conjunction with,
or
after main chemotherapy|63161005|416608005|63161005|367336001
or
radiation treatments.|30821001|276239002|82107009|276239002|108290001|276239002
