*Angina pectoris|225566008
*
*?commonly
known|36692007
as
*
*angina|225566008
*
*?
is
chest pain|29857009
due to ischemia|52674009
of the heart muscle,|74281007
generally
due to obstruction|26036001
or
spasm|45352006
of the coronary arteries.|41801008

The main cause|63161005|134198009
of angina pectoris|225566008
is
Coronary Artery Disease,|53741008|414024009
due to atherosclerosis|38716007
of the arteries|51114001|11527006
feeding|129007004
the heart.|80891009|302509004

The term
derives
from the Latin _angina_|225566008
("infection
of the throat"|54066008|49928004|264231000
)
from the Greek _??????_ _ankhon?_|1451003
("strangling"|63936008
)
,
and
the Latin _pectus_|182331006
("chest"|261179002
)
,
and
can
therefore
be
translated
as "
a strangling feeling|373909009
in the chest".|261179002

There
is
a weak relationship|13791008|272151006|260407003|272151006
between severity|272141005
of pain|22253000
and
degree|258395000|246173007
of oxygen deprivation|24099007
in the heart muscle|74281007
(i.e.,|42146005|22971001
there
can
be
severe pain|76948002
with little|281411007|255507004
or
no risk|30207005
of a heart attack,|22298006
and
a heart attack|22298006
can
occur|272120004
without pain|22253000
).

Worsening|230993007|231877006
("crescendo"
)
angina attacks,|225566008|216299002
sudden-onset angina|385315009|225566008|255363002|225566008
at rest,|258157001
and
angina|225566008
lasting
more
than 15 minutes|258701004|255507004|356624006
are
symptoms
of _unstable angina_|25106000
(usually
grouped|255504006
with similar conditions|260905004
as the acute coronary syndrome.|394659003

As these
may
herald
myocardial infarction|22298006
(
a heart attack|22298006
)
,
they
require
urgent medical attention|103391001|74188005|6769007
and
are
generally
treated|28995006
as a presumed heart attack.|22298006

Also
known|36692007
as
_effort angina_,|300995000
this refers|439980006
to the more common understanding|242762006|72906007|66216009
of angina|225566008
related|272151006|262094002
to myocardial ischemia.|53741008|414795007

Typical presentations|246105001
of stable angina|233819005
is
that
of chest discomfort|279084009
and
associated symptoms|102483000
precipitated
by some activity|48761009|55561003|258745004|257733005
(running,|418060005
walking|129006008
,
etc.
)
with minimal|255605001|255604002
or
non-existent symptoms
at rest.|258157001

Symptoms typically
abate
several minutes|261028005|258701004|261028005|255507004|261028005|356624006
following|255260001
cessation
of precipitating activities|257733005
and
reoccur
when
activity resumes.|48761009|55561003|258745004|257733005

In this way,
stable angina|233819005
may
be
thought|88952004
of
as
being
similar
to claudication symptoms.|16973004|275520000

Unstable angina (UA)|25106000
(also "crescendo angina|25106000
;"
this
is
a form|246176004
of acute coronary syndrome|394659003
is
defined
as angina pectoris|225566008
that changes|243326001|263703002
or
worsens.[1]|230993007|390772001

It
has
at least
one|421379005
of these three features|421291004
:

UA|223657000|167217005
may
occur|272120004
unpredictably
at rest|258157001
which
may
be
a serious indicator|42745003
of an impending heart attack.|71033007|22298006

What
differentiates|263933003
stable angina|233819005
from unstable angina|25106000
(
other than symptoms
)
is
the pathophysiology|386585008
of the atherosclerosis.|38716007

The pathophysiology|386585008
of unstable angina|25106000
is
the reduction|58294000|260400001|289928003
of coronary flow|80891009
due to transient platelet aggregation|14803004|60649002
on apparently normal endothelium,|17621005|27168002|258744000|27168002
coronary artery spasms|23687008
or
coronary thrombosis.|398274000

The process|415178003
starts|255395001|385652002
with atherosclerosis,|38716007
and
when
inflamed
leads|88488004|236874000
to an active plaque,|55561003|4522001|55561003|1522000|55561003|38551001
which
undergoes
thrombosis|118927008
and
results|394617004
in acute ischemia,|272118002|52674009
which finally
results|394617004
in cell necrosis|6574001
after calcium entry.|5540006

Studies|110465008|224699009
show
that 64%
of all unstable anginas|25106000
occur|272120004
between 10 PM
and
8
AM
when
patients|116154003
are
at rest.[5][6]|258157001

In stable angina,|233819005
the developing atheroma|50808002
is
protected
with a fibrous cap.|263756000|228254002|255423002|228254002

This cap (atherosclerotic plaque|228254002|4522001|228254002|1522000|228254002|38551001
)
may
rupture|415747007
in unstable angina,|25106000
allowing
blood clots to|75753009
precipitate
and
further|46053002
decrease|260400001|260370003
the lumen|113342003|342806003|398252006
of the coronary vessel.|80891009|59820001

This
explains
why
an unstable angina|25106000
appears
to
be
independent of activity.|48761009|55561003|258745004|257733005

Microvascular Angina|233845001
or
Angina Syndrome X|233845001
is
characterized
by angina-like chest pain,|225566008|261179002|225566008|29857009
but
has
different causes.|263735002|134198009
The cause|134198009
of Microvascular Angina|233845001
is
unknown|261665006
,
but
it
appears
to
be
the result|394617004
of poor function|11403006|246464006|255351007|246464006
in the tiny blood vessels|59820001
of the heart,|80891009|302509004
arms|40983000
and
legs.|30021000

Since
microvascular angina|233845001
isn't
characterized
by arterial blockages,|51114001|263954005
it's harder to|72505002
recognize
and
diagnose|439401001
,
but
its prognosis|20481000
is
excellent.|425405005

[8] [9] [10]

Most patients|116154003
with angina complain|225566008
of chest discomfort|279084009
rather than
actual pain|22253000
:
the discomfort|367391008|87128005
is
usually
described
as a pressure,|279046003|13543005|257893003
heaviness,
tightness,|255365009
squeezing,|241978003
burning,|90673000|62404004
or
choking sensation.|373909009

Apart from chest discomfort,|279084009
anginal pains|225566008
may
also
be
experienced
in the epigastrium|27947004
(upper central abdomen|279026008|26216008|80581009|26216008
)
,
back,
neck area,|45048000|42798000|302550007|42798000
jaw,|661005|181811001
or
shoulders.|16982005

This
is
explained
by the concept
of referred pain,|6617009
and
is
due to the spinal level|258395000|276625007
that
receives
visceral sensation|397668005
from the heart simultaneously|80891009|79970003|302509004|79970003
receiving
cutaneous sensation|119325001|106148006|119325001|271712005|119325001|272144002|39937001|106148006|39937001|271712005|39937001|272144002|181469002|106148006|181469002|271712005|181469002|272144002
from parts|260726005
of the skin|119325001|39937001|181469002
specified|69658003
by that spinal nerve's dermatome,|244029009|3057000|244029009|256864008|3169005|9611009|3169005|244023005|361099009|9611009|361099009|244023005
without an ability to|371150009
discriminate|43147006
the two.|420797005

Typical locations|246267002
for referred pain|6617009
are
arms|40983000
(often inner left arm|70232002|260521003|368208006|70232002|260521003|72098002
)
,
shoulders,|16982005
and
neck|45048000|302550007
into the jaw.|661005|181811001

Angina|225566008
is
typically
precipitated
by exertion|19487008
or
emotional stress.|442347009

It
is
exacerbated|162473008|410661009
by
having
a full stomach|261015003|69695003|261015003|181246003
and
by cold temperatures.|285686007

Pain|22253000
may
be
accompanied
by breathlessness,|267036007
sweating|161857006
and
nausea|422587007
in some cases.|398241000|413769002

In this case,|398241000
the pulse rate|78564009|8499008
and
the blood pressure increases.|24184005

Chest pain|29857009
lasting
only
a few seconds|57176003|257997001
is
normally
not angina|225566008
(
such as Precordial catch syndrome.|46707002|30623001

Myocardial ischemia|53741008|414795007
comes
about
when
the myocardia|74281007
(
the heart muscles|74281007
)
receive
insufficient blood|71978007|87612001|71978007|119273009|423437008|87612001|423437008|119273009
and
oxygen to|24099007
function|246464006
normally
either
because of increased oxygen demand|238163001
by the myocardia|74281007
or
by decreased supply|1250004|425398004|260400001|425398004|260371004|425398004
to the myocardia.|74281007

This inadequate perfusion|71978007|88058003
of blood|87612001|119273009
and
the resulting reduced delivery|42752001|260400001|236973005|42752001|260400001|118215003
of oxygen|24099007
and
nutrients|226355009
is
directly
correlated
to blocked|26036001|112232007
or
narrowed blood vessels.|134223000|59820001

Some experience "autonomic symptoms"|72167002
(
related|272151006|262094002
to increased activity|28277004
of the autonomic nervous system|72167002
such as nausea,|422587007
vomiting|249497008
and
pallor.|398979000

Major risk factors|255603008|80943009
for angina|225566008
include|55919000
cigarette smoking,|102408007
diabetes,|73211009
high cholesterol,|75540009|84698008|75540009|412808005|371879000|84698008|371879000|412808005
high blood pressure,|38341003
sedentary lifestyle|415510005
and
family history|57177007
of premature heart disease.|1090009|56265001

A variant form|40885006|246176004
of angina|225566008
(Prinzmetal's angina|87343002
occurs|272120004
in patients|116154003
with normal coronary arteries|371860003
or
insignificant atherosclerosis.|38716007

It
is
thought to|88952004
be
caused|23981006|134198009
by spasms|45352006
of the artery.|51114001|11527006

It
occurs|272120004
more
in younger women.|84422007|224526002

[11]

One study|421379005|110465008|421379005|224699009
found|404684003
that smokers|77176002
with coronary artery disease|53741008|414024009
had
a significantly increased level|35105006|258395000|35105006|276625007|260366006|258395000|260366006|276625007
of sympathetic nerve activity|90456006|48761009|90456006|55561003|90456006|258745004|90456006|257733005|181098007|48761009|181098007|55561003|181098007|258745004|181098007|257733005
when
compared
to those without.|45169001

This
is
in addition|260364009
to increases|260366006
in blood pressure,|75367002|392570002|386536003
heart rate|364075005
and
peripheral vascular resistance|386530009
associated|47429007
with nicotine|68540007
which
may
lead|88488004
to recurrent angina attacks.|255227004|225566008|216299002

Additionally,
CDC
reports|229059009|223458004
that
the risk|30207005
of CHD
(Coronary heart disease|53741008
)
,
stroke,|230690007
and
PVD|400047006
(Peripheral vascular disease|400047006
)
is
reduced|260400001
within 1?2 years|303183002|258707000
of smoking cessation.

In another study,|110465008|224699009
it
was
found|404684003
that
after
one year,|421379005|258707000|421379005|259039008
the prevalence
of angina|225566008
in smoking men|365981007|339947000
under 60
after an initial attack|884001|217315002|884001|216299002|232714002|217315002|232714002|216299002
was
40% less|259031006
in those
who
had
quit smoking|365981007
compared
to those
who
continued.|255238004

Studies|110465008|224699009
have
found|404684003
that there
are
short term
and
long term benefits
to smoking cessation.[13][14][15][16]

Myocardial ischemia|53741008|414795007
can
result|394617004
from
:

Atherosclerosis|38716007
is
the most common cause|4757001|72906007|134198009
of stenosis|415582006|246185004|27551008
(narrowing|25659002|134223000
of the blood vessels|59820001
)
of the heart's arteries|80891009|51114001|80891009|11527006|302509004|51114001|302509004|11527006
and
,
hence,
angina pectoris.|225566008

Some people|125676002
with chest pain|29857009
have
normal|17621005|258744000
or
minimal narrowing|255605001|25659002|255605001|134223000|255604002|25659002|255604002|134223000
of heart arteries|80891009|51114001|80891009|11527006|302509004|51114001|302509004|11527006
;
in these patients,|116154003
vasospasm|32318003|71772004
is
a more likely|242762006|2931005
cause|23981006|134198009
for the pain,|22253000
sometimes
in the context|263491009
of Prinzmetal's angina|87343002
and
syndrome X.|233845001

Myocardial ischemia also|53741008|414795007
can
be
the result|394617004
of factors
affecting|247591002|248448006
blood composition,|87612001|119273009
such as reduced oxygen-carrying capacity|260400001|24099007|288345009
of blood,|87612001|119273009
as
seen
with severe anemia|24484000|271737000
(low number|62482003|410680006|62482003|410681005|371880002|410680006|371880002|410681005
of red blood cells|14089001|41898006|258759006|126242007
)
,
or
long-term smoking.|365981007

Angina results|225566008|394617004
when
there
is
an imbalance
between the heart's oxygen demand|80891009|24099007|302509004|24099007
and
supply.|425398004

This imbalance
can
result|394617004
from an increase|260366006
in demand
(e.g.|258795003

during exercise|61686008
)
without a proportional increase|8212001|260366006
in supply|425398004
(e.g.|258795003

due to obstruction|26036001
or
atherosclerosis|38716007
of the coronary arteries|41801008
).

Suspect|415684004
angina|225566008
in people|125676002
presenting|246105001
with tight, dull,|255365009|263744001|255365009|410708008|228187009|263744001|228187009|410708008
or
heavy chest discomfort|410712002|279084009
which
is
:
[23]|264657009

Some people|125676002
present|52101004|246105001
with atypical symptoms,|112231000
including|55919000
breathlessness,|267036007
nausea,|422587007
or
epigastric discomfort|8644006|119416008
or
burping.|275299008

These atypical symptoms|112231000
are
particularly likely|2931005
in older people,|70753007|125676002
women,|224526002
and
those
with diabetes.[23]|73211009|264657009

Angina pain|225566008
is
not usually sharp|410707003
or
stabbing|242879005|410706007
or
influenced
by respiration.|258162000

Anti-acids|34957004
and
simple analgesia|13673007|278414003|13673007|38433004
do
not usually
relieve|397855004
the pain.|22253000

If chest discomfort|279084009
(
of whatever site|10546003
)
is
precipitated
by exertion,|19487008
relieved|398004007
by rest,|258157001
and
relieved|398004007
by glyceryl trinitrate,|387404004
the likelihood|2931005
of angina|225566008
is
increased.[23]|35105006|264657009|260366006|264657009

In angina patients|225566008|116154003
who
are
momentarily
not
feeling|285854004
any one chest pain,|421379005|29857009
an electrocardiogram (ECG)|29303009
is
typically normal,|17621005|258744000
unless
there
have
been
other cardiac problems|74964007|80891009|55607006
in the past.|410513005

During periods|259037005
of pain,|22253000
depression|35489007|366979004|255339005
or
elevation|103720008|255456001
of the ST segment|3030002
may
be
observed.

To
elicit|263516000
these changes,|243326001|263703002
an exercise ECG test|165079009|29303009|46136006|269814003|46136006|46136006|272393004
("treadmill test"|1211003|269814003|1211003|1211003|272393004
)
may
be
performed|398166005
,
during which
the patient|116154003
exercises|61686008|229065009
to their maximum ability|398303009|371150009
before fatigue,|84229001
breathlessness|267036007
or
,
importantly,
pain intervenes|22253000
;
if characteristic ECG changes|29303009|243326001|29303009|263703002
are
documented|397934002
(typically more
than 1 mm|260305007
of flat|6041008|257564005
or
downsloping ST depression|263743007|429622005
)
,
the test|269814003|272393004
is
considered diagnostic|439401001|261004008
for angina.|225566008

Even constant monitoring|302805002
of the blood pressure|75367002|392570002|386536003
and
the pulse rate|78564009|8499008
can
lead|88488004
us
to some conclusion
regarding
the angina.|225566008

The exercise test|165079009
is
also useful
in looking|386548000
for other markers|74964007
of myocardial ischaemia|53741008|414795007
:
blood pressure response|427732000
(
or
lack thereof,|41277001
particularly
a drop|404218003
in systolic pressure|271649006
)
,
dysrhythmia
and
chronotropic response.

Other alternatives|74964007
to a standard exercise test|165079009
include|55919000
a thallium scintigram|71763007|373205008
or
sestamibi scintigram|373205008
(
in patients|116154003
who
cannot
exercise|61686008
enough
for the purposes|363675004
of the treadmill tests,|1211003|269814003|1211003|272393004
e.g.
,
due to asthma|195967001
or
arthritis|3723001
or
in whom
the ECG|29303009
is
too abnormal|263654008
at rest|258157001
)
or
Stress Echocardiography.|262188008|40701008

In patients|116154003
in whom
such noninvasive testing|22762002|22762002|272393004
is
diagnostic,|439401001|261004008
a coronary angiogram|33367005
is
typically
performed|398166005
to
identify|7882003
the nature|277302009
of the coronary lesion,|80891009
and
whether
this
would
be
a candidate
for angioplasty,|418285008
coronary artery bypass graft (CABG),|232717009
treatment only|276239002|416118004
with medication,|410942007
or
other treatments.|74964007|276239002

There
has
been
research
which
concludes
that
a frequency|260864003|272123002
is
attained
when
there
is
increase|260366006
in the blood pressure|75367002|392570002|386536003
and
the pulse rate.|78564009|8499008

This frequency|260864003|272123002
varies
normally
but
the range
is
45?50 kHz|229769005
for the cardiac arrest|397829000
or
for the heart failure._[clarification|84114007|42343007

In patients|116154003
who
are
in hospital|285201006
with unstable angina|25106000
(
or
the newer term|7147002
of "high risk acute coronary syndromes"|15508007|394659003
)
,
those
with resting ischaemic ECG changes|258157001|255426005|29303009|243326001|258157001|255426005|29303009|263703002
or
those
with raised cardiac enzymes|260399008|259669000
such as troponin|102680009
may
undergo
coronary angiography directly.|33367005

The most specific medicine to|4757001|69658003|410942007
treat|395077000
angina|225566008
is
nitroglycerin.|387404004

It
is
a potent vasodilator|30207005|372787008
that
makes
more oxygen|242762006|24099007
available|103328004
to the heart muscle.|74281007

Beta-blockers|373254001
and
calcium channel blockers|373304005
act
to
decrease|260400001|260370003
the heart's workload,|80891009|302509004
and
thus
its requirement
for oxygen.|24099007

Nitroglycerin|387404004
should
not
be
given|419582001
if certain inhibitors|17162000|61511001
such as Sildenafil|372572000
(Viagra
)
,
Tadalafil|407111005
(Cialis
)
,
or
Vardenafil|404858007
(Levitra
)
have
been
taken|419652001
within the previous 12 hours|9130008|259028005|9130008|123035007
as the combination|89780004
of the two|420797005
could
cause|23981006|134198009
a serious drop|42745003|404218003
in blood pressure.|75367002|392570002|386536003

Treatments|276239002
are
balloon angioplasty,
in which
the balloon|47006006|34263000
is
inserted|257867005
at the end|261782000|422117008
of a catheter|19923001
and
inflated
to
widen|90522003
the arterial lumen.|67170007

Stents to|65818007
maintain|385630006
the arterial widening|51114001|90522003|263954005|90522003
are
often|70232002
used|394850002
at the same time.|262126009|410669006

Coronary bypass surgery|232717009
involves|248448006
bypassing constricted arteries|51114001|11527006
with venous grafts.|29092000|24486003|263925004|24486003

This
is
much more invasive|242762006|10179008|4757001|10179008
than angioplasty.|418285008

The main goals|63161005|410518001
of treatment|276239002|416118004
in angina pectoris|225566008
are
relief|224978009
of symptoms,
slowing|419443000
progression|246453008|246450006
of the disease,|64572001
and
reduction|58294000|260400001|289928003
of future events,|272379006
especially heart attacks|22298006
and
death.|419620001|268923008

Beta blockers|373254001
(
e.g.
,
carvedilol,|386870007
propranolol,|372772003
atenolol|387506000
)
have
a large body|255509001|279495008|255509001|123037004
of evidence|18669006
in morbidity
and
mortality benefits|409651001
(fewer symptoms,|57176003
less disability|276139006|21134002|263796003|21134002
and
longer life|255511005|224130005
)
and
short-acting nitroglycerin medications|359530003|387404004|410942007|367450005|387404004|410942007
have
been
used|394850002
since 1879
for symptomatic relief|264931009|224978009
of angina.|225566008

Calcium channel blockers|373304005
(
such as nifedipine|387490003
(Adalat
)
and
amlodipine,|386864001
isosorbide mononitrate|386854005
and
nicorandil|395809002
are
vasodilators commonly|372787008
used|394850002
in chronic stable angina_[citation|90734009|233819005
needed|410525008|103325001

A new therapeutic class,|7147002|262202000|258391009
called
If inhibitor,|61511001
has
recently|6493001
been
made
available|103328004
:
ivabradine|421228002
provides
pure heart rate reduction[25]|364075005|58294000|364075005|260400001|364075005|289928003
leading|236874000
to major anti-ischemic|255603008|255426005
and
antianginal efficacy.

ACE inhibitors|372733002
are
also vasodilators|372787008
with
both
symptomatic|264931009
and
prognostic benefit
and
,
lastly,
statins|372912004
are
the most frequently used lipid/cholesterol modifiers|4757001|70232002|394850002|70106000|84698008|4757001|70232002|394850002|70106000|412808005
which probably also
stabilize|409051000
existing
atheromatous plaque_[citation|50808002

Low-dose aspirin|262459003|387458008
decreases|260370003
the risk|30207005
of heart attack|22298006
in patients|116154003
with chronic stable angina,|90734009|233819005
and
was
previously part|260726005
of standard treatment|276239002|416118004
;
however,
it
has
since
been
discovered
that
the increase|260366006
in haemorrhagic stroke
and
gastrointestinal bleeding offsets|74474003
this gain
so
they
are
no longer|255511005
advised|424900004
unless
the risk|30207005
of myocardial infarction|22298006
is
very high.[26]|260360000

Exercise|61686008
is
also
a very good long term treatment|260358002|20572008|276239002|260358002|20572008|416118004
for the angina|225566008
(
but
only particular regimens - gentle|50607009|420295001

,
[27] probably
working|261041009
by complex mechanisms|103360007|257544000

and
treating risk factors|28995006|80943009

is
a priority|260870009
in patients|116154003
with angina.|225566008

This means|255586005
testing|272393004
for elevated cholesterol|13644009
and
other fats|74964007|256674009
in the blood,|87612001|119273009

New overt heart failures|7147002|84114007

reduced|260400001

however,
the mortality rate difference|409651001|263735002
between the two groups|420797005|261586004|420797005|160481000

statistically insignificant.[28]

The fatty acid oxidation inhibitor mildronate|31979005|26694004|61511001
is
a clinically-used anti-ischemic drug|246488008|255426005
for the treatment|276239002|416118004
of angina|225566008
and
myocardial infarction.|22298006

Mildronate
shifts|9546005
the myocardial energy metabolism|251058001|248272003|74281007|251833007
from fatty acid oxidation|31979005|26694004

under ischemic conditions,|255426005|260905004

including|55919000
gamma-butyrobetaine dioxygenase.|58046006

Mildronate
also
inhibits|61511001
carnitine acetyltransferase|48051008

therefore
acts
as a myocardial energy metabolism regulator.[37]|251058001|248272003|74281007|251833007
