*Paraplegia|60389000
*
*
is
an impairment|40226000
in motor
or
sensory function|106148006
of the lower extremities.|61685007

The word|255373000
comes
from Ionic Greek|48006008|1451003
: ??????????
"half-
striking|89098005
".

It
is
usually
caused|23981006|134198009
by spinal cord injury|90584004
or
a congenital condition|6160004|260905004|255399007|260905004
such as spina bifida|67531005
that
affects|4065008
the neural elements|3057000|57795002|256864008|57795002
of the spinal canal.|61853006

The area|42798000
of the spinal canal|61853006
that
is
affected|247591002|248448006
in paraplegia|60389000
is
either
the thoracic, lumbar,|182343007
or
sacral regions.|46452000

If
all four limbs|421534005|66019005
are
affected|247591002|248448006
by paralysis,|44695005
quadriplegia|11538006
is
the proper terminology.

If
only one limb|50607009|421379005|66019005|50607009|421379005|243996003|420295001|421379005|66019005|420295001|421379005|243996003
is
affected,|247591002|248448006
the correct term
is
monoplegia.|86022000

*
*Spastic paraplegia|192967009
*
*
is
a form|246176004
of paraplegia|60389000
defined
by spasticity|397790002
of the affected muscles,|247591002|91727004|248448006|91727004
rather than
flaccid paralysis.|39157001

Due to the decrease|260400001|260370003
or
loss
of feeling|285854004
or
function|246464006
in the lower extremities,|61685007
paraplegia|60389000
can
contribute
to a number|410680006|410681005
of medical complications|74188005|116223007
including|55919000
pressure sores|420226006
(decubitus|420226006|260452000
)
,
thrombosis,|118927008
and
pneumonia.|205237003

Physiotherapy|91251008
and
various assistive technology,|256220008|360296002
such as a standing frame,|183150009
as well as
vigilant self-observation|27625002|103705002
and -
care,
may
aid|246088000
in helping to
prevent
future complications|116223007
and
mitigate|6736007
existing complications.|116223007

As paraplegia|60389000
is
most often|4757001|70232002
the result|394617004
of a traumatic injury
to the spinal cord tissue|2748008|85756007|180959008|85756007
and
the resulting inflammation,|42752001|257552002
other nerve-related complications|116223007|3057000|272151006|116223007|3057000|262094002|116223007|256864008|272151006|116223007|256864008|262094002
can
and
do
occur.|272120004

Cases|398241000|413769002
of chronic nerve pain|82423001|3057000|82423001|256864008
in the areas|42798000
surrounding|355648006
the point
of injury
are
not uncommon.|103356009

There
is
speculation_[citation
needed|410525008|103325001
_]
that
the "phantom
pains|22253000
"
experienced
by individuals|125676002|385435006
suffering
from paralysis|44695005
could
be
a direct result|255589003|394617004
of these collateral nerve injuries|397406000|57182000
misinterpreted
by the brain.|12738006|258335003

Individuals|125676002|385435006
with paraplegia|60389000
can
range
in their level|258395000|276625007
of disability,|21134002
requiring
treatments to|276239002
vary
from case|398241000
to case.|398241000

From a rehabilitation standpoint,|52052004|394602003
the most important factor|4757001
is
to
gain|35105006|255396000|260366006|260369004|398092000
as much functionality|40143009|246464006
and
independence|371153006
back
as
possible.|371930009|60022001

Physiotherapists|36682004
spend
many hours|258702006
within a rehabilitation setting working|52052004|261041009|394602003|261041009
on strength,|260404005
range of motion/|364564000|85680003
stretching|122546009
and
transfer skills.|302265009

Wheelchair mobility|165242000
is
also
an important skill to
learn.|69998004

Most paraplegics
will
be
dependent|371154000
on a wheelchair|58938008
as a mode
of transportation.

Thus
it
is
extremely important to teach|409073007
them the basic skills to|418836005
gain|35105006|255396000|260366006|260369004|398092000
their independence.|371153006

Activities|257733005
of daily living|69620002
(ADL?s|129025006
)
can
be
quite
challenging
at first|255216001|232714002
for those with a spinal cord injury (SCI).|20401003|90584004|421463005|90584004

With the aid|246088000
of physiotherapists|36682004
and
occupational therapists,|80546007
individuals|125676002|385435006
with an SCI
can
learn|69998004
new skills|7147002
and
adapt
previous ones to|9130008|421379005
maximize
independence,|371153006
often|70232002
living|224130005|419749002
independently
within the community.[3]|133928008
