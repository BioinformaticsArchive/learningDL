play|300776002
/k??r??d??ri?mi.?/|422252006
is
an X-linked recessive retinal degenerative disease|263934009|399625000|33359002|263934009|5665001|362975008|263934009|103067001|362975008
that
leads|88488004|236874000
to the degeneration|33359002
of the choriocapillaris,|36044006|280899009
the retinal pigment epithelium,|41275009
and
the photoreceptor
of the eye.|81745001|244486005

Choroideremia (CHM)|75241009
is
a rare inherited disorder|84638005|255404009|64572001|103356009|255404009|64572001
that
causes|134198009
progressive loss|255314001
of vision|281004000
due to degeneration|33359002
of the choroid|68703001|181172003
and
retina.|5665001|181171005

It
occurs|272120004
almost exclusively
in males.|248153007

In childhood,|68433009
night blindness|65194006
is
the most common first symptom.|4757001|72906007|255216001|4757001|72906007|232714002

As the disease progresses,|64572001|385651009
there
is
loss
of vision,|281004000
frequently|70232002
starting|255395001|385652002
as an irregular ring|49608001|112627000|49608001|257380004
that gradually expands|70955005
both
in
toward central vision|26216008|281004000
and
out
toward the extreme periphery.|12565001|14414005

Progression|246453008|246450006
of the disease|64572001
continues|255238004
throughout the individual's life.|125676002|224130005|385435006|224130005

Both
the rate
of change|243326001|263703002
and
the degree|258395000|246173007
of visual loss|397540003
are
variable|255372005
among those affected, even|247591002|248448006
within the same family.|262126009|35359004

The actual vision loss
is
caused|23981006|134198009
by degeneration|33359002
of several layers|261028005
of cells|4421005
that
are
essential|34325006
to sight.|281004000

These layers,
which
line|50009006
the
inside of the back of the eye,|255551008|81745001|255551008|244486005
are
called
the choroid,|68703001|181172003
the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE),|41275009
and
the retina.|5665001|181171005

The choroid|68703001|181172003
is
a network
of blood vessels|59820001
located
between the retina|5665001|181171005
and
the sclera,|18619003|181163006
the "white|413773004|185984009|371251000
of the eye."|81745001|244486005
Choroidal vessels|68703001|59820001|181172003|59820001
provide
oxygen|24099007
and
nutrients|226355009
to both
the RPE|41275009|262082006
and
the retina's photoreceptor cells.|5665001|4421005|181171005|4421005

The RPE,|41275009|262082006
directly
beneath the retina,|5665001|181171005
supports|9096001|243114000
the function|246464006
of photoreceptor cells.|4421005

Photoreceptors
convert
light|56242006|371268001
into the electrical impulses|18213006|263781002|258096005|263781002
that
transfer|129347002|302265009|129005007
messages
to the brain|12738006|258335003
where "seeing" actually|281004000
occurs.|272120004

In the early stages|264499004|261612004
of Choroideremia,|75241009
the choroid|68703001|181172003
and
the retinal pigment epithelium initially deteriorate.|41275009|884001

Eventually,
photoreceptor cells also|4421005
degenerate.|33359002

As a result,|394617004
vision|281004000
is
lost.

Choroideremia|75241009
is
caused|23981006|134198009
by the deletion
of the Rab escort protein 1 (REP1).|88878007

Rab escort protein 2 (REP2)|88878007
is
75% identical|20323000
and
can
_almost_
compensate|17275008
for the loss
of REP1.

Though
the eye|81745001|244486005
does
express
the REP2 protein|88878007
(
no cell|4421005|362837007
could
survive
without some REP activity|48761009|55561003|258745004|257733005
)
evidently,
in the eye,|81745001|244486005
this
is
not enough.

The REPs
are
essential|34325006
for the prenylation
of Rab proteins.|88878007

Studies|110465008|224699009
have
shown
that there
is
a build up|255532002|353734004
of unprenylated Rab27
in lymphoblasts|15433008
from Choroideremia patients.|75241009|116154003

The link
between the build up|255532002|353734004
of unprenylated Rabs
and
blindness
is
not
known.|36692007

Generally,
only men|50607009|339947000|420295001|339947000
show
symptoms
of this disease,|64572001
Initially|884001
a person suffering|125676002
from choroideremia|75241009
has
night blindness,|65194006
which
begins|255395001
in youth.|22396007

As the disease progresses,|64572001|385651009
a CHM sufferer|75241009
loses
their peripheral vision|77944008
and
depth perception,|251763006
eventually
losing
all sight|281004000
by middle age.|28288005

In some cases,|398241000|413769002
a severe loss|24484000
of acuity
and
color perception|263714004|81742003
become
evident|18669006
as the disease progresses.|64572001|385651009

The former UK Labour Member of Parliament Si?n Simon|9130008|289909005|158746004|262144001|9130008|261041009|158746004|262144001
is
a known sufferer.|36692007

The link
between the loss
of REP1
and
the build up|255532002|353734004
of unprenylated Rab27
and
the degeneration|33359002
of the eye|81745001|244486005
is
unknown|261665006
as yet.

There
is
a genetic blood test to|405824009|87612001|405824009|119273009

Choroideremia.|75241009

attempted
at Moorfields Hospital|285201006
in London,
researchers

have
used gene therapy to|394850002|394613000
attempt
to

the condition|260905004
which
is
caused|23981006|134198009
by a faulty gene|241775008|67271001
