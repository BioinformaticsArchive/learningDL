A
*
*headache|25064002
*
*
or
*
*cephalalgia|25064002
*

is
pain anywhere|22253000
in the region|410673009
of the head|69536005|302548004
or
neck.|45048000|302550007

It
can
be
a symptom
of a number|410680006|410681005
of different conditions|263735002|260905004
of the head|69536005|302548004
and
neck.|45048000|302550007

The brain tissue|256865009|280369009
itself
is
not sensitive|83185005
to pain|22253000
because
it
lacks|41277001
pain receptors.|22253000|116647005

Rather,
the pain|22253000
is
caused|23981006|134198009
by disturbance
of the pain-sensitive structures|22253000|83185005
around the brain.|12738006|258335003

Nine areas|422113007|42798000
of the head|69536005|302548004
and
neck|45048000|302550007
have
these pain-sensitive structures,|22253000|83185005
which
are
the cranium|89546000|181889008
(
the periosteum|33840008
of the skull,|89546000
muscles,|91727004
nerves,|3057000
arteries|51114001|11527006
and
veins,|29092000
subcutaneous tissues,|71966008
eyes,|81745001
ears,|117590005|1910005
sinuses|2095001
and
mucous membranes.|313268005

There
are
a number|410680006|410681005
of different classification systems|263735002|73504009
for headaches.|25064002

The most well-recognized|4757001|20572008
is
that
of the International Headache Society.|25064002

Headache|25064002
is
a non-specific symptom,|10003008
which means|255586005
that
it
has
many possible causes.|371930009|134198009|60022001|134198009

Treatment|276239002|416118004
of a headache|25064002
depends
on the underlying etiology|134198009
or
cause,|134198009
but
commonly
involves|248448006
analgesics.|373265006

Headaches|25064002
are
most thoroughly|4757001
classified|73504009
by the International Headache Society's International Classification of Headache Disorders (ICHD),|230461009|73504009
which
published
the second edition|258240008
in 2004.

This classification|73504009
is
accepted|385645004
by the
WHO.[3]|260313008

Other classification systems|74964007|73504009
exist.

One|421379005
of the first published attempts|255216001|232714002
was
in 1951.

The National Institutes of Health|385437003|263775005
developed
a classification system|73504009
in 1962.[5]

The International Classification of Headache Disorders (ICHD)|73504009|230461009
is
an
in-depth hierarchical classification|131197000|73504009
of headaches|25064002
published
by the International Headache Society.|25064002

It
contains|42504009
explicit
(operational|83578000
)
diagnostic criteria|439401001|261004008
for headache disorders.|230461009

The first version|255216001|22303008|232714002|22303008
of the classification,|73504009
ICHD-1,
was
published
in 1988.

The current revision,|15240007|255231005|15240007|118635009|15240007|261560009
ICHD-2,
was
published
in 2004.[6]

The classification|73504009
uses|277889008|394850002|260676000|419385000
numeric codes.|410680006

The top,|421812003
one-digit diagnostic level|421379005|82680008|439401001|258395000|421379005|82680008|439401001|276625007|421379005|82680008|261004008|258395000|421379005|82680008|261004008|276625007|421379005|361367007|439401001|258395000|421379005|361367007|439401001|276625007|421379005|361367007|261004008|258395000|421379005|361367007|261004008|276625007
includes|55919000
13 headache groups.|25064002|261586004|25064002|160481000

The first four|255216001|421534005|232714002|421534005
of these
are
classified|73504009
as primary headaches,|63161005|25064002|261424001|25064002
groups|261586004|160481000
5-12|264706000|264605009
as secondary headaches,|2603003|25064002|81170007|25064002
cranial neuralgia,|23096007
central|26216008
and
primary facial pain|63161005|95668009|261424001|95668009
and
other headaches|74964007|25064002
for the last two groups.[7]|420797005|261586004|420797005|160481000

The ICHD-2 classification|73504009
defines
migraines,|37796009
tension-types headaches,|66551002
cluster headache|193031009
and
other trigeminal autonomic cephalalgias|74964007|72167002|25064002
as the main types|63161005|261664005
of primary headaches.|63161005|25064002|261424001|25064002

Also,
according to the same classification,|262126009|73504009
stabbing|242879005|410706007
headaches|25064002
and
headaches|25064002
due to cough,|272039006
exertion|19487008
and
sexual activity|365952006
(coital cephalalgia|25064002
are
classified|73504009
as primary headaches.|63161005|25064002|261424001|25064002

The daily-persistent headaches|69620002|25064002
along
with the hypnic headache|258158006|25064002
and
thunderclap headaches|95660002
are
considered
primary headaches|63161005|25064002|261424001|25064002
as well.|20572008

Secondary headaches|2603003|25064002|81170007|25064002
are
classified|73504009
based|418836005
on their etiology|134198009
and
not
on their symptoms.

According to the ICHD-2 classification,|73504009
the main types|63161005|261664005
of secondary headaches|2603003|25064002|81170007|25064002
include|55919000
those that
are
due to head|69536005|302548004
or
neck trauma|45048000|45048000|302550007|302550007
such as whiplash injury,|39848009
intracranial hematoma,|303231004|385494008
post craniotomy|288563008|25353009
or
other head|74964007|69536005|74964007|302548004
or
neck injury.|90460009

Headaches|25064002
caused|23981006|134198009
by cranial|89546000|66787007
or
cervical vascular disorders|63339007|59820001|261064006|27550009
such as ischemic stroke|422504002
and
transient ischemic attack,|266257000
non-traumatic intracranial hemorrhage,|82894007
vascular malformations
or
arteritis|52089001
are
also
defined
as secondary headaches.|2603003|25064002|81170007|25064002

This type|261664005
of headaches|25064002
may
also
be
caused|23981006|134198009
by cerebral venous thrombosis|95455008
or
different intracranial vascular disorders.|263735002|62914000

Other secondary headaches|74964007|2603003|25064002|74964007|81170007|25064002
are
those
due to intracranial disorders|303231004|64572001
that
are
not vascular|59820001
such as low|62482003|371880002
or
high pressure|75540009|279046003|75540009|13543005|75540009|257893003|371879000|279046003|371879000|13543005|371879000|257893003
of the cerebrospinal fluid pressure,|281668000
non-infectious inflammatory disease,|191415002
intracranial neoplasm,|254935002
epileptic seizure|313307000
or
other types|74964007|261664005
of disorders|64572001
or
diseases|64572001
that
are
intracranial|303231004
but
that
are
not
associated|47429007
with the vasculature
of the central nervous system.|21483005|278199004

ICHD-2 classifies headaches|73504009|25064002
that
are
caused|23981006|134198009
by the ingestion|111984006
of a certain substance|17162000|105590001
or
by its withdrawal
as secondary headaches|2603003|25064002|81170007|25064002
as well.|20572008

This type|261664005
of headache|25064002
may
result|394617004
from the overuse
of some medications|410942007
or
by exposure|71677004|24932003
to some substances.|105590001

HIV/AIDS,|19030005|62479008|86406008|62479008|402916007|62479008
intracranial infections|303231004
and
systemic infections|91302008
may
also
cause|23981006|134198009
secondary headaches.|2603003|25064002|81170007|25064002

The ICHD-2 system|246333005
of classification|73504009
includes|55919000
the headaches|25064002
associated|47429007
with homeostasis disorders|21979002|64572001
in the category
of secondary headaches.|2603003|25064002|81170007|25064002

This means|255586005
that headaches|25064002
caused|23981006|134198009
by dialysis,|108241001|265764009
high blood pressure,|38341003
hypothyroidism,|40930008
and
cephalalgia|25064002
and
even
fasting|16985007
are
considered
secondary headaches.|2603003|25064002|81170007|25064002

Secondary headaches,|2603003|25064002|81170007|25064002
according to the same classification system,|262126009|73504009
can
also
be
due to the injury
of any
of the facial structures|89545001
including|55919000
teeth,|38199008
jaws,|661005
or
temporomandibular joint.|53620006|181814009

Headaches|25064002
caused|23981006|134198009
by psychiatric disorders|74732009
such as somatization
or
psychotic disorders|69322001
are
also
classified|73504009
as secondary headaches.|2603003|25064002|81170007|25064002

The ICHD-2 classification|73504009
puts
cranial neuralgias|23096007
and
other types|74964007|261664005
of neuralgia|247398009
in a different category.|263735002

According to this system,|246333005
there
are
19 types|261664005
of neuralgias|247398009
and
headaches|25064002
due to different central causes|263735002|26216008|134198009
of facial pain.|95668009

Moreover,
the ICHD-2
includes|55919000
a category
that
contains|42504009
all the headaches|25064002
that
cannot
be
classified.|73504009

Although
the ICHD-2
is
the most complete headache classification there|4757001|255594003|25064002|73504009
is
and
it
includes|55919000
frequency|260864003|272123002
in the diagnostic criteria|439401001|261004008
of some types|261664005
of headaches|25064002
(primarily primary headaches|63161005|25064002|261424001|25064002
)
,
it
does
not specifically
code
frequency|260864003|272123002
or
severity|272141005
which
are
left|7771000
at the discretion
of the examiner.[8]

The NIH classification|73504009
consists
of brief definitions|359530003|359535008
of a limited number|255469002|410680006|255469002|410681005
of headaches.[9]|25064002

The NIH system|246333005
of classification|73504009
is
more succinct|242762006
and
only
describes
five categories|421820001
of headaches.|25064002

In this case,|398241000
primary headaches|63161005|25064002|261424001|25064002
are
those that
do
not
show
organic
or
structural etiology.|134198009

According to this classification,|73504009
headaches|25064002
can
only
be
vascular, myogenic, cervicogenic, traction|59820001|66391000
and
inflammatory.

There
are
over 200 types|21481007|261664005
of headache,|25064002
and
the causes range|134198009
from harmless
to life-threatening.|224130005

The description
of the headache,|25064002
together with findings|404684003
on neurological examination,|84728005
determines
the need|410525008|103325001
for any further investigations|46053002|386053000
and
the most appropriate treatment.[10]|4757001|276239002|4757001|416118004

The most common types|4757001|72906007|261664005
of headache|25064002
are
the "primary headache disorders",|63161005|230461009|261424001|230461009
such as tension-type headache|66551002
and
migraine.|37796009

They
have
typical features
;
migraine,|37796009
for example,
tends
to
be
pulsating|255356002
in character,
affecting|247591002|248448006
one side|66459002
of the head,|69536005|302548004
associated|47429007
with nausea,|422587007
disabling
in severity,|272141005
and
usually lasts
between 3 hours|260313008|258702006
and
3 days.|260313008|258703001

Rarer primary headache disorders|84638005|63161005|230461009|84638005|261424001|230461009|103356009|63161005|230461009|103356009|261424001|230461009
are
trigeminal neuralgia|31681005
(
a shooting face pain|49575005|89545001|49575005|302549007|410705006|95668009
)
,
cluster headache|193031009
(severe pains|76948002
that
occur|272120004
together
in bouts
)
,
and
hemicrania continua|443095000
(
a continuous headache|255238004|25064002
on one side|66459002
of the head|69536005|302548004
).[10]

Headaches|25064002
may
be
caused|23981006|134198009
by problems elsewhere|55607006
in the head|69536005|302548004
or
neck.|45048000|302550007

Some
of these
are
not harmful,
such as cervicogenic headache|279016001
(pain arising|22253000|68727004
from the neck muscles|81727001
).

Medication overuse headache|410942007|25064002
may
occur|272120004
in those
using|260676000
excessive painkillers|260378005
for headaches,|25064002
paradoxically
causing|23981006
worsening headaches.[10]|230993007|25064002|231877006|25064002

A number|410680006|410681005
of characteristics
make
it more likely|242762006|2931005
that
the headache|25064002
is
due to potentially dangerous secondary causes|2603003|134198009|81170007|134198009
;
some
of these
may
be
life-threatening|224130005
or
cause|23981006|134198009
long-term damage.|37782003

A number|410680006|410681005
of "red flag" symptoms therefore means|386713009|255586005|371240000|255586005
that
a headache warrants further investigations,|25064002|46053002|386053000
usually
by a specialist.|309395003

The red flag symptoms|386713009|371240000
are
a new|7147002
or
different headache|263735002|25064002
in someone over 50 years old,|21481007|258707000|70753007
headache|25064002
that
develops
within minutes|258701004|255507004|356624006
(thunderclap headache,|95660002
inability to
move|302000008|384598002|370125004
a limb|66019005|243996003
or

"Thunderclap headache"|95660002
may
be
the only symptom|50607009|420295001
of subarachnoid hemorrhage,|21454007
a form|246176004
of stroke|230690007
in which blood|87612001|119273009
accumulates

often|70232002
from a ruptured brain aneurysm.|22039006|12738006|22039006|258335003

Headache|25064002
with fever|386661006
may
be
caused|23981006|134198009
by meningitis,|7180009
particularly
if
there
is
meningism|437986008
(inability to

due to particular viruses.|49872002

Headache|25064002
that
is
worsened|390772001|231877006
by straining|102548001
or
a change|243326001|263703002
in position|246449006

be
caused|23981006|134198009
by increased pressure|51590001
in the skull|89546000
;
this
is
often worse|70232002|230993007|70232002|390772001|70232002|231877006
in the morning|73775008
and
associated|47429007
with vomiting.|249497008

Raised intracranial pressure|271719001
may
be
due to brain tumors,|126952004
idiopathic intracranial hypertension|68267002
(IIH,
more common|242762006|72906007
in younger overweight women|84422007|238131007|224526002

and
occasionally cerebral venous sinus thrombosis.|192759008

Headache|25064002
together with weakness|13791008|260407003
in part|260726005
of the body|279495008|123037004

particularly
when

may
indicate|410535002
giant cell arteritis (GCA),|414341000
in which
the blood vessel wall|59820001|224727009|361097006|224727009
is
inflamed
and
obstructs|263821009
blood flow.|58190003

Carbon monoxide poisoning

in the eyeball|81745001
may
lead|88488004
to headache,|25064002
particularly
around the eye,|81745001|244486005
as well as
visual abnormalities,|255374006|276654001
nausea,|422587007
vomiting|249497008
and
a red eye|75705005
with a dilated pupil.[10]|37125009

The brain|12738006|258335003
itself
is
not sensitive|83185005
to pain,|22253000
because
it
lacks|41277001
pain receptors.|22253000|116647005

However,
several areas|261028005|42798000
of the head|69536005|302548004
and
neck|45048000|302550007
do
have
nociceptors,
and
can
thus
sense|106148006
pain.|22253000

These
include|55919000
the extracranial arteries,|303232006|51114001|303232006|11527006
large veins,|33858002
cranial|89546000|66787007
and
spinal nerves,|3169005
head|69536005|302548004
and
neck muscles|81727001
and
the meninges.[11]|363824000

Headache often|25064002|70232002
results|394617004
from traction|66391000
to
or
irritation|257553007
of the meninges|363824000
and
blood vessels.|59820001

The nociceptors
may
also
be
stimulated
by other factors|74964007
than head trauma|82271004
or
tumors|108369006
and
cause headaches.|134198009|25064002

Some
of these
include|55919000
stress,|262188008
dilated blood vessels|271589007
and
muscular tension.|250069006

Once
stimulated
,
a nociceptor
sends
a message
up the length|410668003
of the nerve fiber|88545005
to the nerve cells|47220008
in the brain,|12738006|258335003
signaling|38952000
that
a part|260726005
of the body hurts.[12]|279495008|123037004

It
has
been
suggested
that
the level|258395000|276625007
of endorphins|53682000
in one's body|421379005|279495008|421379005|123037004
may
have
a great impact|255509001|134293005|263768009|134293005
on
how people|125676002
feel|285854004
headaches_[citation|25064002
needed|410525008|103325001
_].

Thus,
it
is
believed
that people|125676002
who
suffer
from chronic headaches|90734009|25064002
or
severe headaches|24484000|25064002
have
lower levels|261122009|258395000
of endorphins|53682000
compared
to people|125676002
who
do
not
complain
of headaches.|25064002

Primary headaches|63161005|25064002|261424001|25064002
are
even more difficult to|52925006
understand|66216009
than secondary headaches.|2603003|25064002|81170007|25064002

Although
the pathophysiology|386585008
of migraines,|37796009
cluster headaches|193031009
and
tension headaches|66551002
is
still
not well understood, there|20572008|66216009
have
been
different theories|263735002
over time|410669006
which
attempt
to
provide
an explanation
of what exactly
happens
within the brain|12738006|258335003
when
individuals|125676002|385435006
suffer
from headaches.|25064002

One|421379005
of the oldest|70753007
such theories
is
referred to|439980006
as
the vascular theory|59820001
which
was
developed
in the middle|255562008|399488007
of the 20th century.

The vascular theory|59820001
was
proposed
by Wolff
and
it
described
the intracranial vasoconstriction|303231004|32318003
as
being
responsible|394851003
for the aura|18618006
of the migraine.|37796009

The headache|25064002
was
believed
to
result|394617004
from the subsequent rebound|255260001
of the dilatation|129419002|25322007
of the blood vessels|59820001
which
led|88488004|236874000
to the activation
of the perivascular nociceptive nerves.|255564009|3057000

The developers
of this theory
took|419652001
into consideration
the changes|243326001|263703002
that
occur|272120004
within the blood vessels|59820001
outside the cranium|89546000|181889008
when
a migraine attack|37796009|217315002|37796009|216299002
occurs|272120004
and
other data|74964007
that
was
available|103328004
at
that time|410669006
including|55919000
the effect|253861007
of vasodilators|372787008
and
vasoconstrictors|372881000
on headaches.|25064002

The neurovascular approach
towards primary headaches|63161005|25064002|261424001|25064002
is
currently|15240007
accepted|385645004
by most specialists.|309395003

According to this newer theory,|7147002
migraines|37796009
are
triggered|410658008
by a complex series|103360007|13039001
of neural|3057000|256864008
and
vascular events.|59820001|272379006

Different studies|263735002|110465008|263735002|224699009
concluded
that individuals|125676002|385435006
who
suffer
from migraines|37796009
but
not
from headache|25064002
have
a state|398070004
of neuronal hyperexcitability|47220008
in the cerebral cortex,|40146001
especially
in the occipital cortex.|31065004

People|125676002
who
are
more susceptible to|242762006|131196009
experience
migraines|37796009
without headache|25064002
are
those who
have
a family history|57177007
of migraines,|37796009
women,|224526002
and
women|224526002
who
are
experiencing
hormonal changes|278994005|243326001|278994005|263703002
or
are
taking birth control pills|419652001|423938009|419652001|5935008
or
are
prescribed
hormone replacement therapy.[15]|266717002

The American College of Emergency Physicians|224864007|25876001|309343006
have
guidelines
on the evaluation|386053000
and
management|413454004|119270007
of adult patients|133936004|116154003
who
have
a nontraumatic headache|25064002
of acute onset.[11]|255363002

While
,
statistically,
headaches|25064002
are
most likely to|4757001|2931005
be
primary|63161005|261424001
(non serious|42745003
and
self-limiting|255469002
)
,
some specific secondary headache syndromes|69658003|2603003|230461009|69658003|81170007|230461009
may
demand
specific treatment|69658003|276239002|69658003|416118004
or
may
be
warning signals
of more serious disorders.|242762006|42745003|64572001

Differentiating|263933003
between primary|63161005|261424001
and
secondary headaches|2603003|25064002|81170007|25064002
can
be
difficult.|52925006

As
it
is
often difficult|70232002|52925006
for patients to|116154003
recall
the precise details
regarding
each headache,|25064002
it
is
often useful|70232002
for the sufferer
to fill-out
a "headache diary" detailing|25064002
the characteristics
of the headache.|25064002

When
the headache|25064002
does
not clearly
fit|91175000|102499006
into one|421379005
of the recognized primary headache syndromes|63161005|230461009|261424001|230461009
or
when
atypical symptoms|112231000
or
signs|72670004
are
present|52101004|246105001
then further investigations|46053002|386053000
are
justified.

Neuroimaging
(noncontrast head CT|408754009
)
is
recommended
if there
are
new neurological problems|7147002|299960009
such as decreased level|1250004|258395000|1250004|276625007|260400001|258395000|260400001|276625007|260371004|258395000|260371004|276625007
of consciousness,|106167005
one sided weakness,|66459002|13791008|66459002|66459002|260407003
pupil size difference,|392406005|129806009|35146001|129806009
etc.

or
if
the pain|22253000
is
of sudden onset|385315009|255363002
and
severe,|24484000
or
if
the person|125676002
is
known HIV positive.|36692007|402916007

People|125676002
over the age|424144002
of 50 years|258707000
may
also
warrant
a CT scan.[11]|77477000

In recurrent unexplained headaches|255227004|25064002
keeping
a "headache diary"|25064002
with entries
on type|261664005
of headache,|25064002
associated symptoms,|102483000
precipitating
and
aggravating factors|162473008
may
be
helpful.

This
may
reveal|263857004
specific patterns,|69658003|272135003
such as an association|263534001|272151006
with medication,|410942007
menstruation|248957007
or
absenteeism|8015008|360484006
or
with certain foods.|17162000|255620007

It
was
reported|229059009|223458004
in March 2007
by two separate teams|420797005|263869007
of researchers
that
stimulating
the brain|12738006|258335003
with implanted electrodes|40388003|16470007
appears
to
help
ease
the pain|22253000
of cluster headaches.[17]|193031009

Acupuncture|44868003
has
been
found|404684003
to
be
beneficial
in chronic headaches[18]|90734009|25064002
of
both
tension type[19]|53489000|261664005
and
migraine type.|37796009|261664005

Research
comparing acupuncture|44868003
to 'sham' acupuncture|44868003
has
shown
that
the results|394617004
of acupuncture|44868003
may
be
due to the placebo effect.[20]|253861007

One type|421379005|261664005
of treatment,|276239002|416118004
however,
is
usually
not sufficient|51117008
for chronic sufferers|90734009
and
they
may
have
to
find
a variety
of different ways|263735002
of managing,|119270007
living|224130005|419749002
with,
and
seeking treatment|276239002|416118004
of chronic daily headache pains.[21]|82423001|69620002|25064002

There
are
however two types|420797005|261664005
of treatment|276239002|416118004
for chronic headaches,|90734009|25064002
i.e.|42146005|22971001

acute abortive treatment|272118002|276239002|272118002|416118004
and
preventive treatment.|169443000

Whereas
the first|255216001|232714002
is
aimed to
relieve|397855004
the symptoms immediately,|49499008
the latter
is
focused|87017008|363702006
on controlling|54776003|31509003
the headaches|25064002
that
are
chronic.|90734009

For this reason,|410666004
the acute treatment|272118002|276239002|272118002|416118004
is
commonly
and
effectively
used|394850002
in treating migraines|28995006|37796009
and
the preventive treatment|169443000
is
the usual approach
in managing chronic headaches.|119270007|90734009|25064002

The primary goal|63161005|410518001|261424001|410518001
of preventive treatment|169443000
is
to
reduce|260400001
the frequency,|260864003|272123002
severity,|272141005
and
duration|103335007
of headaches.|25064002

This type|261664005
of treatment|276239002|416118004
involves|248448006
taking medication|129019007
on a daily basis|69620002|69620002|418836005
for
at least 3 months|276139006|258706009|263796003|258706009
and
in some cases,|398241000|413769002
for over 6 months.|21481007|258706009

The medication|410942007
used|394850002
in preventive treatment|169443000
is
normally
chosen
based|418836005
on the other|74964007
conditions|78326006|260905004
that
the patient|116154003
is
suffering
from.

Generally,
medication|410942007
in preventive treatment|169443000
starts|255395001|385652002
at the minimum dosage|255605001|277406006|255604002|277406006
which
increases|260366006
gradually
until the pain|22253000
is
relieved|398004007
and
the goal|410518001
achieved
or
until side effects
appear.

To date,|410671006
only amitriptyline,|50607009|372726002|420295001|372726002
fluoxetine,|372767007
gabapentin,|386845007
tizanidine,|373440006
topiramate,|386844006
and
botulinum toxin type A (BoNTA)|427412002
have
been
evaluated
as "prophylactic treatment|169443000
of chronic daily headache|90734009|69620002|25064002
in randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled|1305003|31509003|1305003|31509003
or
active comparator-controlled trials.|55561003|31509003|110465008

Antiepileptics
can
be
used|394850002
as preventative treatment|169443000
of chronic daily headache|90734009|69620002|25064002
and
includes|55919000
Valproate.[22]|372812003

Psychological treatments|60224009|276239002
are
usually
considered
in comorbid patients|116154003
or
in those
who
are
unresponsive|20646008|422768004
to the medication.|410942007

During a given year,|258707000|259039008
90%|264705001|264703008
of people|125676002
suffer
from headaches.|25064002

Of the ones|421379005
seen
in the ER,
about 1%
have
a serious underlying problem.[23]|42745003|55607006|264657009

Primary headaches|63161005|25064002|261424001|25064002
account
for more
than 90%|264705001|264703008
of all headache complaints,|25064002|409586006
and
of these,
episodic tension-type headache|230470007
is
the most common.[24]|4757001|72906007

It
is
estimated|414135002
that women|224526002
are
three times|421291004|410669006|421291004|417929005
more prone|242762006|1240000
than men to|339947000
suffer
from migraines.|37796009

Also,
the prevalence
of this particular type|261664005
of headache|25064002
seems
to
vary
depending
on the specific area|69658003|42798000
of the world
where one lives.|421379005|224130005

However,
migraines|37796009
appear
to
be
experienced
by 12%
to 18%
of the population.[24]|385436007|389109008

Cluster headaches|193031009
are
thought|88952004
to
affect|4065008
less
than 0.5%|260316000
of the population,|385436007|389109008
though
their prevalence
is
hard to|72505002
estimate|414135002
because
they
are
often|70232002
mistaken
for a sinusal problem.|301202006

However,
according to the existent data,
cluster headaches|193031009
are
more likely to|242762006|2931005
occur|272120004
in men|339947000
than women,|224526002
given|419582001
that
the condition|260905004
tends
to
affect|4065008
5
to 8 times more men.|410669006|339947000|417929005|339947000

The first recorded classification system|255216001|73504009|232714002|73504009
that
resembles
the modern ones|421379005
was
published
by Thomas Willis,
in _
De Cephalalgia_|25064002
in 1672.

In 1787 Christian Baur generally divided headaches|276116000|422033008|25064002|160549006|422033008|25064002
into idiopathic|54690008
(primary headaches|63161005|25064002|261424001|25064002
)
and
symptomatic|264931009
(secondary ones|2603003|421379005|81170007|421379005
)
,
and
defined
84 categories.[9]

Children|410601007|160499008
can
suffer
from the same types|262126009|261664005
of headaches|25064002
as adults|133936004
do
although
their symptoms
may
vary.

Some kinds|261664005
of headaches|25064002
include|55919000
tension headaches,|66551002
migraines,|37796009
chronic daily headaches,|90734009|69620002|25064002
cluster headache|193031009
and
sinus headaches.|4969004

Dental braces|360316004|415686002|272363005
and
orthodontic headgear|277105002
(
due to the constant pressure|279046003|13543005|257893003
placed|257557008|421066005
on the jaw area|661005|42798000|181811001|42798000
)
are
also
known|36692007
for causing|23981006
occasional|84638005
to frequent headaches|70232002|25064002
in adolescents.|133937008

It
is
actually common|72906007
for headaches to|25064002
start|255395001
in childhood|68433009
or
adolescence,|22396007
for instance,
20%
of adults|133936004
who
suffer
headaches|25064002
report|229059009|223458004
that
their headaches|25064002
started|385652002
before age 10|424144002
while
50% report|229059009|223458004
they
started|385652002
before age 20.|424144002

The incidence
of headaches|25064002
in children|410601007|160499008
and
adolescents|133937008
is
very common.|260358002|72906007

One study|421379005|110465008|421379005|224699009
reported|229059009|223458004
that 56%
of boys|433152004
and
74%
of girls|431549007
between 12
and
17
indicated|410535002
having
experienced
a form|246176004
of headache|25064002
within the past month.[26]|410513005|258706009|410513005|259036001

The causes|134198009
of headaches|25064002
in children|410601007|160499008
include|55919000
either
one factor|421379005
or
a combination|89780004
of factors.

Some
of the most common factors|4757001|72906007
include|55919000
genetic predisposition,|47708004
especially
in the case|398241000
of migraine|37796009
;
head trauma,|82271004
produced
by accidental falls|217082002
;
illness|39104002
and
infection,
for example
in the presence|386397008
of ear|117590005|1910005
or
sinus infection|36971009
as well as
colds|82272006
and
flu|6142004
;
environmental factors,|102487004
which
include|55919000
weather changes|243326001|263703002
;
emotional factors,|285854004|408453002
such as stress,|262188008
anxiety,|48694002|197480006
and
depression|35489007|366979004|255339005
;
foods|255620007
and
beverages,
caffeine|255641001
or
food additives|59533004
;
change|243326001|263703002
in sleep|258158006
or
routine pattern|50811001|272135003
;
loud noises.|24547000

Also,
excess physical activity|260378005|48761009
or
sun|49926000
may
be
a trigger specifically|410658008
of migraine.[27]|37796009

Although
most cases|398241000|413769002
of headaches|25064002
in children|410601007|160499008
are
considered
to
be
benign,|30807003
when
they
are
accompanied
with other symptoms|74964007
such as speech problems,
muscle weakness,|26544005
and
loss
of vision,|281004000
a more serious underlying cause|242762006|42745003|134198009
may
be
suspected|415684004
:
hydrocephalus,|230745008
meningitis,|7180009
encephalitis,|45170000
abscess,|128477000
hemorrhage,|131148009
tumor,|108369006
blood clots,|75753009
or
head trauma.|82271004

In these cases,|398241000|413769002
the headache evaluation|25064002|25064002|386053000
may
include|55919000
CT scan|77477000
or
MRI|113091000
in order to
look|386548000
for possible structural disorders|371930009|64572001|60022001|64572001
of the central nervous system.[28]|21483005|278199004

Some measures|246445000|367346004
can
help
prevent
headaches|25064002
in children.|410601007|160499008

Some
of them
are
drinking plenty|160573003|30953006
of water|11713004|119318008
throughout the day|258703001|259032004
;
avoiding caffeine|255641001
;
getting
enough
and
regular sleep|17854005|258158006
;
eating balanced meals|48263008|78933003
at the proper times|410669006|417929005
;
and
reducing stress|260400001|262188008
and
excess|260378005
of activities.[29]|257733005
