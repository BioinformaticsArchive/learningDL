*Anencephaly|89369001
*
*
is
a cephalic disorder|66787007|64572001
that results|394617004
from a neural tube defect|253098009
that
occurs|272120004
when
the cephalic|66787007
(head|69536005|302548004
)
end|261782000|422117008
of the neural tube|60271003
fails
to
close|29179001
,
usually
between the 23rd
and
26th day|258703001|259032004
of pregnancy,|289908002
resulting|42752001
in the absence|2667000|418560003
of a major portion|255603008|260726005
of the brain,|12738006|258335003
skull,|89546000
and
scalp.|41695006|181480002

Strictly speaking,|87335007
the translation
of the Greek term|1451003
to English|297487008|25804004
is
"
no brain"|12738006|258335003
(
that
is
,
totally
lacking|41277001
)
,
but
it
is
accepted|385645004
that children|410601007|160499008
with this disorder|64572001
are
born|106970005|81827009|398209006
without a forebrain,|81861006
the largest part|255509001|260726005|263768009|260726005
of the brain|12738006|258335003
consisting
mainly
of the cerebral hemispheres,|372073000
including|55919000
the neocortex,
which
is
responsible|394851003
for higher-level cognition.|75540009|258395000|75540009|276625007|371879000|258395000|371879000|276625007

The remaining brain tissue|256865009|280369009
is
often|70232002
exposed,|24932003
i.e.|42146005|22971001

not
covered|255334000
by bone|272673000|3138006|90780006|128530007
or
skin.|119325001|39937001|181469002

With very few exceptions,|260358002
[3] most babies|260313008|418119000
with this disorder|64572001
do
not
survive.

The National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS)|385437003|230690007|64572001|385437003|118940003|230690007
describes
the presentation|246105001
of this condition|260905004
as
follows|367409002
:
"
A baby|418119000
born|106970005|81827009|398209006
with anencephaly|89369001
is
usually blind, deaf,
unconscious,|418107008
and
unable to|371151008
feel|285854004
pain.|22253000

Although
some individuals|125676002|385435006
with anencephaly|89369001
may
be
born|106970005|81827009|398209006
with a main brain stem,|63161005|15926001
the lack|41277001
of a functioning cerebrum permanently|246464006|11628009|246464006|372073000|246464006|83678007|246464006|263353005
rules|10828004
out
the possibility
of ever gaining consciousness.|35105006|106167005|35105006|255396000|106167005|255396000|260366006|106167005|260366006|260369004|106167005|260369004|398092000|106167005|398092000

Reflex actions|87572000
such as breathing|14910006|258162000
and
responses
to sound|68325009
or
touch|386476006|52962008|397624008
may
occur."[2]|272120004

The cause|134198009
of anencephaly|89369001
is
disputed.|9182005

Generally,
neural tube defects|253098009
do
not
follow|367409002|421939007
direct patterns|255589003|272135003
of heredity,
though
there
is
some indirect evidence|255541007|18669006
of inheritance,|246071007
[4]|260308009
and
recent animal models|6493001|387961004
indicate|410535002
a possible association|371930009|263534001|371930009|272151006|60022001|263534001|60022001|272151006
with deficiencies|260372006|248325000
of the transcription factor TEAD2.|10589004

Studies|110465008|224699009
show
that
a woman|224526002
who
has
had
one child|421379005|410601007|421379005|160499008
with a neural tube defect|253098009
such as anencephaly|89369001
has
about
a 3% risk|260313008|30207005
of
having
another child|410601007|160499008
with a neural tube defect,|253098009
[6]
as
opposed
to the background rate
of 0.1% occurrence|272120004
in the population|385436007|389109008
at large.[7]|255509001

It
is
known|36692007
that women|224526002
taking|419652001
certain medications|17162000|410942007
for epilepsy|313307000
and
women|224526002
with insulin-dependent diabetes|46635009
have
a higher risk|15508007
of
having
a child|410601007|160499008
with a neural tube defect.|253098009

Genetic counseling|79841006
is
usually
offered|410527000
to women|224526002
at a higher risk|15508007
of
having
a child|410601007|160499008
with a neural tube defect to|253098009
discuss
available testing.|103328004|103328004|272393004

Recent studies|6493001|110465008|6493001|224699009
have
shown
that
the addition|260364009
of folic acid|63718003|104660009
to the diet|41829006
of women|224526002
of child-bearing age|410601007|106970005|424144002|410601007|81827009|424144002|410601007|398209006|424144002|160499008|106970005|424144002|160499008|81827009|424144002|160499008|398209006|424144002
may
significantly
reduce|260400001
,
although
not
eliminate
,
the incidence
of neural tube defects.|253098009

Therefore,
it
is
recommended
that
all women|224526002
of child-bearing age consume 0.4 mg|410601007|106970005|424144002|427264006|410601007|81827009|424144002|427264006|410601007|398209006|424144002|427264006|160499008|106970005|424144002|427264006|160499008|81827009|424144002|427264006|160499008|398209006|424144002|427264006
of folic acid daily,|63718003|69620002|104660009|69620002
[2] especially|260306008
those attempting to
conceive
or
who
may
possibly|60022001
conceive
,
as
this
can
reduce|260400001
the risk|30207005
to 0.03%.

It
is
not advisable to
wait
until pregnancy|289908002
has
begun|255395001
,
since
by the time|410669006
a woman|224526002
knows|36692007
she
is
pregnant,|77386006|127362006
the critical time|410669006
for the formation|11798007|255277001
of a neural tube defect|253098009
has
usually already
passed.

A physician|309343006
may
prescribe
even higher dosages|75540009|277406006|371879000|277406006
of folic acid|63718003|104660009
(4 mg/day|260308009|258835005
)
for women|224526002
who
have
had
a previous pregnancy|127362006
with a neural tube defect.[9]|253098009

Anencephaly|89369001
and
other physical|74964007|5880005|74964007|19388002
and
mental deformities|276654001
have
also
been
blamed
on a high exposure|75540009|71677004|75540009|24932003|371879000|71677004|371879000|24932003
to such toxins|80917008
as lead,|88488004
chromium,|111070004|412351000
mercury,|45262002
and
nickel.[10]|33396006

Until
recently,|6493001
medical literature|74188005
did
not
indicate|410535002
a connection|263538003
among many genetic disorders,|32895009
both
genetic syndromes|290028006
and
genetic diseases,|429962007
that
are
now
being
found to|404684003
be
related.|272151006|262094002

As a result|394617004
of new genetic research,|7147002|3950001|7147002|255395001
some
of these
are
,
in fact,
highly|75540009
related|272151006|262094002
in their root cause|85077000|134198009|2338009|134198009
despite the widely
varying
set
of medical symptoms|74188005
that
are
clinically visible|24054004
in the disorders.|64572001

Anencephaly|89369001
is
one|421379005
such disease,|64572001
part|260726005
of an emerging class|258391009
of diseases|64572001
called
ciliopathies.

The underlying cause|134198009
may
be
a dysfunctional molecular mechanism|386585008|290005005|257544000
in the primary cilia|63161005|69315009|63161005|85803001|261424001|69315009|261424001|85803001
structures
of the cell,|4421005|362837007
organelles|116194001
which
are
present|52101004|246105001
in many cellular types|4421005|246238003
throughout the human body.|279495008|281189005

The cilia defects adversely|69315009|6920004|85803001|6920004
affect|4065008
"numerous critical developmental signaling pathways" essential|260396001|278923009|38952000|34325006
to cellular development|4421005|278923009
and
thus
offer|410527000
a plausible hypothesis
for the often multi-symptom nature|70232002|260396001|277302009
of a large set|255509001
of syndromes
and
diseases.|64572001

Known ciliopathies|36692007
include|55919000
primary ciliary dyskinesia,|86204009|42402006
Bardet-Biedl syndrome,|5619004
polycystic kidney
and
liver disease,|235856003
nephronophthisis,|204958008
Alstrom syndrome,|63702009
Meckel-Gruber syndrome,|29076005
and
some
forms|246176004
of retinal degeneration.[11]|95695004

Anencephaly|89369001
can
often|70232002
be
diagnosed|439401001
before birth|3950001
through an ultrasound examination.|359659005|5880005

The maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein|72705000|104404005|72705000|365804002
(AFP screening[12]|20135006
and
detailed fetal ultrasound[13]|359659005
can
be
useful
for screening|20135006
for neural tube defects|253098009
such as spina bifida|67531005
or
anencephaly.|89369001

There
is
no cure
or
standard treatment|276239002|416118004
for anencephaly|89369001
and
the prognosis|20481000
for patients|116154003
is
death.|419620001|268923008

Most anencephalic fetuses|4757001
do
not
survive
birth,|3950001
accounting
for 55%|264691008
of non-aborted cases.|398241000|413769002

If
the infant|418119000
is
not
stillborn
,
then
he
or
she
will
usually
die|419620001|399069006|419099009
within a few hours|57176003|258702006
or
days|258703001
after birth|237679004|3950001|288563008|3950001
from cardiorespiratory arrest.[2][14]|410430005

To date,|410671006
there
are
only three recorded cases|50607009|421291004|398241000|50607009|421291004|413769002|420295001|421291004|398241000|420295001|421291004|413769002

for 3 years|260313008|258707000

In almost
all cases,|398241000|413769002
anencephalic infants|418119000
are
not aggressively
resuscitated|304252001
because
there
is
no chance
of the infant ever|418119000
achieving
a conscious existence.

Instead,
the usual clinical practice|58147004
is
to
offer|410527000
hydration,|405006006
nutrition,|87276001|384759009
and
comfort measures|133918004
and
to "let nature|277302009
take|419652001
its course".|288524001

Artificial ventilation,|40617009
surgery|83578000
(to
fix|102491009
any
co-existing
congenital defects|276654001
)
,
and
drug therapy|416608005
(
such as antibiotics|255631004
are
usually
regarded
as futile efforts.|19487008

Some clinicians
and
medical ethicists|74188005
view|246516004
even
the provision
of nutrition|87276001|384759009
and
hydration|405006006
as
medically
futile._[citation

In the United States,|223688001
anencephaly|89369001
occurs|272120004
in about 1
out of every 10,000 births.|3950001

Research
has
suggested
that,
overall,
female babies|169839008
are
more likely to|242762006|2931005
be
affected|247591002|248448006
by the disorder.[20]|64572001

Meronanencephaly
is
a rare form|84638005|246176004|103356009|246176004
of anencephaly|89369001
characterized
by malformed cranial bones,|276654001|181792001

a cranial protrusion|89546000|112639008|66787007|112639008
called
area cerebrovasculosa.|42798000

Area cerebrovasculosa|42798000
is
a section|62083003|118630004

disorganized choroid plexuses.[21]|80621003|264450003

The most common type|4757001|72906007|261664005
of anencephaly,|89369001
in which
the brain|12738006|258335003
is
completely absent.[21]|2667000

The most severe type|4757001|24484000|261664005

It
has
been
found|404684003
that cartilage homeoprotein|61496007
(CART1
)
is
selectively
expressed
in chondrocytes|433180002
(cartilage cells|433180002
).

The CART1 gene|67271001

and
meroanencephaly
in the Cart1-deficient mutants.[23][24]|260372006|264657009|418446003|264657009

Modern philosophers_[citation
needed|410525008|103325001
_]
define
personhood
as consciousness|106167005
of the external world,|261074009
in which
a
being
sustains self-consciousness,|263892007|106167005|263892007
self-determination,
rational capacities,
emotional expressions,|285854004|10012005|408453002|10012005
willful direction,|260672003
and
communicative|263536004
and
social abilities.|371150009

However,
a conflicting issue|15863006|55607006
is
the idea|363878000
of potentiality?|30207005
someone who
is
in a coma|371632003|405809000
can
still
have
the capacity to
function.|246464006

In
regards
to those in a coma,|52101004|371632003|52101004|405809000|18720000|371632003|18720000|405809000
such individuals|125676002|385435006
are
said|66049007
to
have
latent capacity.|44104002

Latent capacity|44104002
describes
a future
or
delayed ability to|371150009
function.|246464006

The crux
of the ethical
and
legal implications|398165009
of anencephaly|89369001
lies|40199007|255576009
with an anencephalic's status|263490005
as a person.|125676002

One|421379005
of the major issues|255603008|55607006
concerning
personhood
is
organ donation.

Initial legal guidance|884001|398165009|420227002|232714002|398165009|420227002
came
from the case|398241000
of Baby Theresa|418119000
in 1992,
in which
the boundaries
of organ donation
were
tested|272393004
for the first time.|255216001|410669006|232714002|410669006

Infant organs|418119000|410653004
are
scarce,
and
the high demand|75540009|371879000
for pediatric organ transplants|394537008|410653004|24486003
poses
a major public health issue.|255603008|310115006|55607006

In 1999,
it
was
found|404684003
that
among children|410601007|160499008
who
die|419620001|399069006|419099009
under the age|424144002
of two,|420797005
thirty
to fifty percent|118582008
do
so|223528007
while
awaiting
transplant.|263903005|24486003

In order
for infant organs to|418119000|410653004
be
viable|263927007
and
used|394850002
for transplant,|263903005|24486003
they
must
be
removed|127485006
while
the infant|418119000
is
still alive.|438949009

However,
this poses
both
legal|398165009
and
ethical issues.|55607006

In the United States,|223688001
some
states|398070004
have
laws
that
forbid
the removal|118292001|128303001
of organs|410653004
from a donor|105468003
until
after
the donor|105468003
has
died.|419620001|419099009

And
from this,
several questions|261028005|42425007
have
been
posed.

Are
anencephalics,
in fact,
alive?|438949009

There
are
at least three different arguments|276139006|421291004|263735002|9182005|263796003|421291004|263735002|9182005
in support|9096001|243114000
of
or
against donation
of anencephalic organs|410653004
based|418836005
on utilitarian, Kantian,
and
pro-life views.|52541003|224130005|246516004

Utilitarians
believe
that
the choice
that
benefits
the most amount|4757001|107651007
of people|125676002
is
the most ethical choice.|4757001

In the case|398241000
of organ donation,
since
anencephalics
aren't
sentient
and
can
never
experience
either
pain|22253000
or
pleasure,
using|260676000
their organs to|410653004
maximize
the happiness|112080002
of society
through saving
the lives|224130005
of other infants|74964007|418119000
is
the logical
and
ethical choice
(
rather than
letting
both
infants|418119000
die|419620001|399069006|419099009
).

The Kantian view|246516004
follows|367409002
that ethics
should
be
based|418836005
on duty
and
principle
rather than
end goals,|261782000|410518001|422117008|410518001
and
that moral imperatives
are
revealed|263857004
by universalizing
a moral decision.

And
since,
if
all anencephalic infants|418119000
were
to
have
their organs|410653004
donated
to other infants|74964007|418119000
at birth,|3950001
there
would
be
no obviously societally detrimental effects|253861007
while
instead
improving|385633008
/
saving
the lives|224130005
of
that
many more infants,|242762006|418119000
we
have
the moral imperative to do so.

Finally,
the pro-life position|52541003|224130005|246449006
is
against organ donation
in this case|398241000
on the grounds
that human life|278412004|224130005
begins|255395001
at conception,|13693004
and
upon the religious conviction|62458008
that
all human life|278412004|224130005
is
sacred
and
inviolable.

According to this logic, anencephalics therefore
have
the right to life,|24028007|224130005
regardless of their non-sentience.

At the core|260235002
of the dispute|9182005
between pro-life|52541003|224130005
and
other views|74964007|246516004
is
the status|263490005
of anencephalics
as persons.|125676002

Ultimately,
the goal|410518001
of those in support|52101004|9096001|52101004|243114000|18720000|9096001|18720000|243114000
of organ donation
is
that
it
will
decrease|260400001|260370003
the shortage
in infant organs.|418119000|410653004

It
has
been
estimated|414135002
that 400-500 infant hearts|418119000|80891009
and
kidneys|64033007|17373004
and
500-1,000 infant livers|418119000|10200004
are
needed|410525008|103325001
in the United States|223688001
each year.|258707000|259039008

Currently,|15240007
laws
in some states|398070004
prevent
organ transplantation|410653004|263903005
from living persons,|125676002
and
federal laws
forbid
the use|277889008|419385000
of any form|246176004
of euthanasia.|28631002

Because
anencephalic neonates|133933007
have
partially
functioning|246464006
brain stems,|15926001
they
reserve
some
of the body?s autonomic functions,|279495008|72167002|246464006|123037004|72167002|246464006
such as those
of the heart,|80891009|302509004
kidneys|64033007|17373004
and
intestines.|261093006

For this reason,|410666004
some
believe
that anencephalic neonates|133933007
are
functioning human beings|246464006|278412004
despite the absence|2667000|418560003
of all cognitive function.[27]|311465003

The pros|52541003
of organ donations
are
that
many children|410601007|160499008
will
be
saved
from death,|419620001|268923008
and
additionally,
parents|40683002
of many anencephalic children|410601007|160499008
believe
that
some good|20572008
comes
from organ donation.

Furthermore,
it
saves
the costs
of caring
for a terminally ill child|367391008|410601007|367391008|160499008
;
and
instead of two babies|420797005|418119000
dying|399069006
,
health care providers
are
able to|371150009
save one.|421379005

The cons|67540009|69059007
are
that several laws|261028005
prevent
removing organs|127485006|410653004
from a living
being
or
make
organ donation
from anencephalics
impossible,
some organs|410653004
from anencephalic children|410601007|160499008
cannot
be
transported|57188001|360300001
due to abnormalities|276654001
and
the fear|1402001
that there
is
not
a significant amount|386134007|107651007
of anencephalic donors to
reach|282679008
the demand
for certain organs,|17162000|410653004
such as kidneys.[28]|64033007|17373004

Within the medical community,|74188005|133928008
the main ethical issues|63161005|55607006
with organ donation
are
a misdiagnosis
of anencephaly,|89369001
the slippery slope argument,|9182005
that anencephalic neonates|133933007
would
rarely|103356009
be
a source|260753009
of organs,|410653004
and
that
it
would
undermine
confidence|225487001
in organ transplantation.|410653004|263903005

Slippery slope concerns
are
a major issue|255603008|55607006
in personhood debates,
across the board.

In
regards
to anencephaly,|89369001
those
who
oppose
organ donation
argue
that
it
could
open|56116003
the door|224751004
for involuntary organ donors|105461009
such as an elderly person|105436006
with severe dementia.|24484000|12348006|24484000|52448006

Another point
of contention
is
the number|410680006|410681005
of children|410601007|160499008
who
would
actually
benefit.

There
are
discrepancies|110287002
in statistics
;
however,
it
is
known|36692007
that
most anencephalic children|410601007|160499008
are
stillborn.[27]

Proposals
have
been
made
to
bypass
the legal|398165009
and
ethical issues|55607006
surrounding|355648006
organ donation.

These
include|55919000
waiting
for death to|419620001|268923008
occur|272120004
before harvesting organs,
expanding|70955005
the definition
of death,|419620001|268923008
creating
a special legal category|67995009|398165009
for anencephalic infants,|418119000
and
defining
them
as
non-persons.[28]|125676002

There
are
four different concepts|421534005|263735002
used|394850002
to
determine
brain death|12738006|419620001|12738006|268923008|258335003|419620001|258335003|268923008
:
failure|76797004
of heart|80891009|302509004
and
lungs,|39607008
whole brain death,|260232004|12738006|419620001|260232004|12738006|268923008|260232004|258335003|419620001|260232004|258335003|268923008
and
neocortical death.|419620001|268923008

Some
argue
that anencephalics
experience
neocortical death,|419620001|268923008
in which there
is
an irreversible loss
of consciousness|106167005
and
self-awareness,|225510008
two determinants|420797005
of a person.|125676002

Brain death|12738006|419620001|12738006|268923008|258335003|419620001|258335003|268923008
is
another source|260753009
of support|9096001|243114000
for organ donation.[29]

Neocortical death,|419620001|268923008
similar
to a persistent vegetative state (PVS),|24473007
involves|248448006
loss
of cognitive functioning|413384008|311465003
of the brain.|12738006|258335003

A proposal by law professor,
David Smith,|308323009
in an attempt to
prove|277025001
that neocortical death|419620001|268923008
should
legally
be
treated|28995006
the same|262126009
as brain death,|12738006|419620001|12738006|268923008|258335003|419620001|258335003|268923008
involved PET|248448006
scans
to
determine
the similarities.

However
this
is
not
a well-received proposal|20572008
considering
the contradicting views|246516004
on classifying brain death.[30]|73504009|12738006|419620001|73504009|12738006|268923008|73504009|258335003|419620001|73504009|258335003|268923008

Anencephaly|89369001
can
be
diagnosed|439401001
prenatally
with a high degree|75540009|258395000|75540009|246173007|371879000|258395000|371879000|246173007
of accuracy.|263656005

Given|419582001
that anencephaly|89369001
is
a fatal condition,|399166001|260905004
parents|40683002
receive
the option
of abortion|70317007|386639001
either
in the second|81170007|257997001|288495006
or
third trimester|255248002
of pregnancy,|289908002
depending
on the abortion laws|70317007|386639001
in the state.|398070004

In 2012,
Brazil|223715002
extended|255536004|288467006|255590007
the right|24028007
of abortion|70317007|386639001
to mothers|72705000
with anencephalic fetuses.

This decision
is
,
however,
receiving
much disapproval
by several religious|261028005|62458008
and
human rights|278412004|24028007
groups.[31]|261586004|264664006|160481000|264664006

The "
drawing
the line" rebuttal seeks to|50009006
establish|263748003
when
a fetus|83418008
becomes
a person|125676002
and
if
it
is
able to|371150009
think|88952004
by itself.[32]

The case|398241000
of baby Theresa|418119000
was
the beginning|255395001
of the ethical debate
over anencephalic infant organ donation.|418119000

The story
of baby Theresa|418119000
remains
a focus|87017008|363702006
of basic moral philosophy.|418836005

Baby Theresa|418119000
was
born|106970005|81827009|398209006
with anencephaly|89369001
in 1992.

Her parents,|40683002
knowing|36692007
that
their child|410601007|160499008
was
going
to
die|419620001|399069006|419099009
,
requested|385644000
that
her organs|410653004
be
given|419582001
for transplantation.|263903005

Although
her physicians|309343006
agreed
,
Florida law|224048003
prohibited
the infant's organs|418119000|410653004
from
being
removed|127485006
while
she
was
still alive.|438949009

By the time|410669006
she
died|419620001|419099009
nine days|422113007|258703001
after birth,|237679004|3950001|288563008|3950001
her organs|410653004
had
deteriorated past
the point
of
being
viable.[33]|263927007|264667004

Baby K|418119000
was
an anenecephalic infant|418119000
that
was
kept
alive|438949009
for two years|420797005|258707000
and
174 days|258703001
under intensive care
by order
of the
US
Court
of Appeals
for the Fourth Circuit.|29970001

The Uniform Determination of Death Act (UDDA)|27617004|419620001|27617004|268923008
is
a model bill,|27883009
adopted|160496001
by many
US states,|398070004
stating|398070004
that
