known|36692007
as
*
*broken wind|10169006
*
*,
*
*heaves|10169006
*
*,
or
sometimes
by the term usually
used|394850002
for humans|278412004
("chronic obstructive pulmonary disease"|413846005
or
"disorder"|64572001
)
,
is
a respiratory disease|50043002
in horses.|35354009

This
is
a chronic condition|90734009|260905004
of horses|35354009
involving|248448006
an allergic bronchitis|405720007
characterised
by wheezing,|56018004
coughing|272039006
and
laboured breathing.|248549001

An allergic reaction|421961002
to certain otherwise innocuous substances - allergens,|17162000|105590001|90260006
typically dust|33008008
and
mold spores|23988000
(e.g.|258795003

Aspergillus spp.|2429008
).

It
is
therefore most common|72906007
in horses|35354009
fed|238092004
on hay
and
bedded|229772003
on straw.

Endotoxins|18127008
from organisms|410653004
in the bedding
and
feedstuffs
may
also
play|300776002
a role.[2][3]

The condition|260905004
is
most common|4757001|72906007
in the Northern Hemisphere -
it
is
rare|84638005|103356009
in the South.

This
is
probably because northern horses|35354009
are
more likely to|242762006|2931005
be
overwintered
in stables|58158008
or
barn,
and
therefore
become
sensitised
more readily.|242762006

In contrast
to human asthma|278412004|195967001
(
which it otherwise
resembles
)
,
RAO
is
associated primarily|47429007
with neutrophil mediated inflammation,|116712007|73510009|257552002
and
IgE
and
mast cells|6445007
are
much less important|242762006|4757001
in the pathophysiology.[4]|386585008

NOTE
:
A similar condition,|260905004
Summer Pasture Associated RAO also|47429007
exists.

In this case,|398241000
the allergens|90260006
are
derived
from fodder
and
pasture.

This
is
more common|242762006|72906007
is
summer,
and
management|413454004|119270007
is
reversed
:
horses|35354009
should
be
stabled|58158008
in well ventilated areas.|52101004|20572008|42798000|18720000|20572008|42798000

Symptoms
include|55919000
,
primarily,
increased|35105006|260366006
respiratory effort|248565000
and
dyspnea,|267036007
especially
in response
to strenuous exercise.|61686008

In some cases|398241000|413769002
(secondarily
)
,
the horse|35354009|388441000|388445009
may
present|52101004|246105001
with acute severe dyspnea,|272118002|24484000|267036007
such
that
it really
struggles
to
inspire|14910006
sufficient air.|51117008|417696007

This
is
a veterinary emergency.|53216000|25876001

In addition,|260364009
a soft, moist cough|37378003|17461003|272039006
may
be
seen
,
most commonly
in association|263534001|272151006
with exercise|61686008
or
eating.|48263008

This cough|272039006
may
be
productive,
with expectoration|45710003
of thick, viscous sputum.|277903005|78949001

There
may
also
be
an audible wheeze.|56018004

In chronic cases,|90734009|398241000|90734009|413769002
a "heave line"|10169006|50009006
may
be
visible|24054004
on the ventral abdomen.|277112006|52731004|302553009

This
is
caused|23981006|134198009
by hypertrophy|56246009
of the extrinsic respiratory muscles.|261074009|86419007|255400000|86419007

If
any
of these symptoms
are
observed
,
veterinary advice|53216000|420227002
should
be
sought.

The veterinarian|106290006
will
usually auscultate
(listen|37931006
to the horse's chest|35354009|261179002|388441000|261179002|388445009|261179002
with a stethoscope|53639001
)
to
attempt
to
detect|260373001
adventitious lung sounds.|53972003|39607008|53972003|181216001

If
these
are
very quiet,|260358002|255357006
a rebreathing bag|37284003
may
be
used|394850002
-
a plastic bag|61088005|37284003
over the nose to|260540009|181195007
intensify
the horse's respiratory effort|35354009|248565000|388441000|248565000|388445009|248565000
and
hence
the sounds.

*
*
This procedure|71388002
can
be
dangerous
and
should
not
be
attempted
by non-professionals.
*
*

Blood gas analysis|167018008|91308007
may
also
be
carried|288345009
out,|255529000
although
it
is
rarely|103356009
required.

In some cases,|398241000|413769002
a bronchoalveolar lavage|397395005|232595000|397394009
may
be
carried|288345009
out -|255529000
an endoscope|37270008
is
used to|394850002
look|386548000
down the trachea,|44567001|181213009
and
mucus|49909006
and
cells|4421005
are
washed out|60119000
of the lower airways|261122009|43725001|261122009|89187006
for analysis.|272389005

Typically,
a BAL
recovers|74822006
an abnormally high percentage|371879000|118582008
of neutrophils|116712007
from an RAO horse -|35354009|388441000|388445009
up to 50
or
70%
in severe cases.[5][6]|24484000|398241000|24484000|413769002

If
a horse|35354009|388441000|388445009
is
severely dyspnoeic|24484000
(
that
is
,
struggling
to breathe|14910006|258162000
)
,
the most important measure to|4757001|246445000|4757001|272391002
take|419652001
is
to
remove|127485006
it
from the stable|58158008
or
barn
into fresh air.|261013005|417696007

This
can
be
a life-saving measure|224130005|246445000|224130005|272391002
in an acute attack.|272118002|217315002|272118002|216299002

Seek
veterinary advice immediately.|53216000|420227002|49499008

As RAO
is
primarily
a management condition,|413454004|260905004|119270007|260905004
primary treatment|63161005|276239002|63161005|416118004|261424001|276239002|261424001|416118004
is
managemental.|413454004|119270007

Where possible,|371930009|60022001
the horse|35354009|388441000|388445009
should
be
turned|282987006
out
to pasture.

When
removed|127485006
from the allergens|90260006
in the stable,|58158008
the symptoms
will
usually subside,
although
they
will
recur|246455001
if
the horse|35354009|388441000|388445009
is
stabled again|58158008
at a later date.[7]|260383002|410671006

If
this
is
not practical, certain alterations|17162000|255544004
to stable routine|58158008|50811001
may
be
effective.|255403003|254648000

The aim
is
to
minimise
dust|33008008
and
maximise air quality|417696007|263496004
in the stable.|58158008

This
may
be
achieved
by soaking hay|42691000
or
feeding|129007004
a dust-free alternative|33008008|37837009
(
such as haylage.

The length|410668003
of time to|410669006
soak|42691000
hay
for the maximum benefit|398303009
is
debated
;
however,
approximately 30 minutes|26175008|259030007
appears
to
be
the current consensus.[8][9]|15240007

Feeding|129007004
from the ground
is
often|70232002
thought to|88952004
be
more beneficial|242762006
than
in a hay net,|255442003
as
this
allows
any mucus|49909006
to drain|32712000
out of the lungs.|39607008

Those horses|35354009
that
must
continue|255238004
to
be
stabled|58158008
are
normally
bedded|229772003
on paper,|50833004
or
a combination|89780004
of rubber matting|43230003
and
paper.|50833004

Straw
and
wood shavings|14402002|284890002
contain|42504009
dust|33008008
and
may
irritate
the condition further,|260905004|46053002
although
some modern "low dust" shavings|62482003|33008008|284890002|371880002|33008008|284890002
are
thought|88952004
to
be
better|3442003
than straw.[10]

Despite management changes,|413454004|243326001|413454004|263703002|119270007|243326001|119270007|263703002
pharmacological intervention|56183000|225334002
is
often|70232002
required,
and
almost invariably
in severe cases.|24484000|398241000|24484000|413769002

This breaks
down
into a number|410680006|410681005
of categories
:

1
)
Bronchodilators|372580007
:
Often,|70232002
bronchodilators|372580007
are
the mainstay
of therapy.|276239002

One|421379005
of the most common|4757001|72906007
is
clenbuterol,|425138006
either
as an oral medication|260548002|410942007
administered|418283001
twice daily in feed,|229799001|129007004
or
via the intravenous route.

Alternatively,
aerosolised drugs,|410942007
such as salbutamol|372897005
or
clenbuterol,|425138006
may
be
used.|394850002

Clenbuterol also|425138006
has
anti-inflammatory actions,|330901000|129264002
and
is
therefore often|70232002
preferred.|225773000

Other bronchodilators|74964007|372580007
that
may
be
used|394850002
include|55919000
aminophylline,|373508009
although
this
may
lead|88488004
to excitation,
and
is
only effective|50607009|255403003|50607009|254648000|420295001|255403003|420295001|254648000
in 50%
of cases,|398241000|413769002
[13]
or
ipratropium|372518007
(
which
is
relatively short|359530003|367450005
acting
at 4?6 hours duration|123031003|103335007
).[14]

In an emergency,|25876001
intravenous clenbuterol|425138006|255560000|425138006
or
atropine|372832002
may
be
used|394850002
,
but
care
must
be
exercised|61686008|229065009
with atropine,|372832002
as
it
may
predispose
to adverse systemic side effects|31099001|182353008
such as mydriasis,|37125009
excitement,|58901008
GI stasis|19685008
and
colic.[15]|73063007

2
)
Corticosteroids|79440004
:
Oral steroids|260548002|116566001
such as prednisolone|116601002
are
commonly
used|394850002
;
however,
side effects
are
common,|72906007
and
the horse|35354009|388441000|388445009
may
be
predisposed
to laminitis.|370479001

Therefore,
the use|277889008|419385000
of aerosolised steroids|116566001
via an equine inhaler|35354009|420317006|35354009
are
becoming
more common.|242762006|72906007

This route|284009009
of administration|413454004|416118004
reduces|260400001
the dose|277406006|408102007
required
,
and
the risk|30207005
of side effects.

Originally,
beclomethasone|116574000
was
used|394850002
,
but
newer compounds|7147002|62105006
are
available now,|103328004
such as fluticasone propionate.[16]|396064000

3
)
Mast cell stabilisers|372553000
:
Cromoglycate
has
been
used|394850002
,
but
this
is
may
or
may
not
be
fully effective,|255403003|254648000
as
in RAO mast cells|6445007
have
only
a peripheral role|14414005
in the pathophysiology.[17]|386585008

Care
should
be
taken|419652001
with these drugs|410942007
in competition horses,|35354009
as
many
of them
are
forbidden substances|105590001
under racing|415229000
and
FEI rules.|10828004

4
)
Hay Steamers
:
A relatively new method|7147002|260686004|7147002|272394005
of dealing
with RAO
with horses|35354009
is
to thoroughly
Steam|27177009
the Hay
in a commercially available steamer.|103328004

Feedback
from users
is
very|260358002
encouraging
on the relief factor|224978009
obtained|398092000
from RAO.

Consistency|107646001
in feeding horses|129007004|35354009
is
important
and
the hay
is
just
another
feed|129007004
component.|246093002

A great number|255509001|410680006|255509001|410681005|263768009|410680006|263768009|410681005
of horses|35354009
suffer
from respiratory conditions|258162000|260905004|449071006|260905004
that
is
a direct result|255589003|394617004
of the hay
they
are
feeding|129007004
on.

Stored hay|440276004
contains|42504009
dust|33008008
and
fungal spores|46901008
that
can
cause|23981006|134198009
irritation|257553007
and
inflammation,|257552002
that
can
lead|88488004
to COPD,|413846005
airway|43725001|89187006
and
digestive conditions.|106079008|260905004|86762007|260905004

RAO often|70232002
limits|255469002
the horse's ability to|35354009|371150009|388441000|371150009|388445009|371150009
work|261041009
,
and
it
may
find
strenuous activity|48761009|55561003|258745004|257733005
difficult.|52925006

However,
with prompt diagnosis|439401001
and
treatment|276239002|416118004
the condition|260905004
can
be
managed|119270007
successfully.
