In humans,|278412004
the formation|11798007|255277001
of body odors|81917002
is
mainly
caused|23981006|134198009
by skin glands excretions|110485007|63911002
and
bacterial activity.|404265009

Between the different types|263735002|261664005
of skin glands,|110485007
the human body odor|279495008|103371008|281189005|103371008|278412004|81917002
is
primarily
the result|394617004
of the apocrine sweat glands,|127855006
which
secrete
the majority
of chemical compounds|441900009
needed|410525008|103325001
for the skin flora to|119325001|39937001|181469002
metabolize
it
into odorant substances.|105590001

This happens mostly
in the axillary|422543003
(armpit|422543003|361288001
)
region,|410673009
although
the gland|362884007
can
also
be
found|404684003
in the areola,|29745008
anogenital region,|261157007
and
around the navel.|78220002

In humans|278412004
the armpit regions|422543003|410673009|361288001|410673009
seem
more important|242762006
than the genital region|182349006
for body odor|81917002
which
may
be
related|272151006|262094002
to human bipedalism.|278412004

The genital|263767004
and
armpit regions also|422543003|410673009|361288001|410673009
contain|42504009
springy hairs|386045008
which
help
diffuse body odors.[3]|19648000|81917002

Body odor|81917002
is
influenced
by the actions|129264002
of the skin flora,|119325001|39937001|181469002
including|55919000
members|394852005
of _Corynebacterium_,|77086004
which manufacture enzymes|90668006
called
lipases|72993008
that break down|263690001
the lipids|70106000
in sweat to|74616000|161857006
create
smaller molecules|263796003|290005005|255507004|290005005
like butyric acid.|226361007

These smaller molecules smell,|263796003|290005005|397686008|255507004|290005005|397686008
and
give|419582001
body odor|81917002
its characteristic aroma.

Propionic acid|102711007
(propanoic acid|102711007
)
is
present|52101004|246105001
in many sweat samples.|74616000|123038009|161857006|123038009

This acid|34957004
is
a breakdown product|40091007|125366008
of some amino acids|52518006
by propionibacteria,|34844008
which
thrive
in the ducts|343011009
of adolescent|133937008
and
adult sebaceous glands.|133936004|1028005

Because
propionic acid|102711007
is
chemically similar|441900009
to acetic acid|422082008
with similar characteristics
including|55919000
odor,|103371008
body odors|81917002
may
be
identified|7882003
as
having
a vinegar-|227565008
like smell|397686008
by certain people._[citation|17162000|125676002
needed|410525008|103325001
_] Isovaleric acid|102655009
(3-methyl butanoic acid|260313008|226361007
)
is
the other source|74964007|260753009
of body odor|81917002
as a result|394617004
of actions|129264002
of the bacteria _Staphylococcus epidermidis_,|409822003|60875001
[5]|264706000|264605009
which
is
also
present|52101004|246105001
in several strong cheese types.|261028005|260404005|102264005|261664005

Factors
such as food,|255620007
drink,|226465004
and
diseases|64572001
can
affect|4065008
body odor.|81917002

An individual's body odor|125676002|81917002|385435006|81917002
is
also
influenced
by lifestyle,|60134006
gender,|263495000
genetics,
and
medication.|410942007

Although
today body odor|81917002
is
mostly
viewed|246516004
as
something negative,|260385009
in many animals body odor|387961004|81917002
played|300776002
and
still
plays|300776002
an important survival function.|246464006

Strong body odor|260404005|81917002
can
be
a warning signal
to
would
be
predators to
stay
away,
or
it
can
be
also
a signal
that
the prey animal|387961004
is
unpalatable.

For example,
some animals species,|387961004|69658003
who feign death to|419620001|268923008
survive
(
like possums,
in this state|398070004
produce
a strong body odor to|260404005|81917002
deceive
a predator
that
the prey animal|387961004
has
been
dead|419620001
for a long time|255511005|410669006
and
is
already
in the advanced stage|86005002|21191007|86005002|371508000|86005002|261612004
of decomposing.

Some animals|387961004
with strong body odor|260404005|81917002
are
rarely|103356009
attacked|52684005
by most
of the predators,
although
they
can
be
still
killed|248007002
and
eaten|48263008
by the birds|387972009
of prey,
who
have
very poor sense|260358002|11403006|106148006|260358002|255351007|106148006
of smell.|397686008

Body odor|81917002
is
an important feature
of animal morphology.|387961004|116676008|387961004|72724002

It
plays|300776002
a different role|263735002
in different animal species.|263735002|387961004|69658003

For example,
in some predator species,|69658003
who
use|277889008|419385000
stalking
as a means|255586005
of hunt
(
for example
big|255509001
and
small cats,|255507004|448169003|255507004|388618001
the absence|2667000|418560003
of body odor|81917002
is
highly important,|75540009
and
they
spend
plenty
of time|410669006
and
energy to|248272003
keep
their body|279495008|123037004
free|37837009
of odor.|103371008

For other predators,|74964007
who
use|277889008|419385000
long running|255511005|418060005
after the prey
as a means|255586005
of hunting
(dogs,|448771007
wolves,|82676003
the absence|2667000|418560003
of body odor|81917002
is
not so important,
on the contrary,
can
play|300776002
a role
of warning signal.

In most
of the animals body odor intensifies|387961004|81917002
in the moment
of stress|262188008
and
danger.

Sebaceous
and
apocrine glands|2789006
become
active|55561003
at puberty.|18991001

This,
as well as
many apocrine glands|2789006
being
close|29179001
to the sex organs,|258139002|410653004|365952006|410653004|263495000|410653004|70256003|410653004|57312000|410653004
points
to a role
related|272151006|262094002
to mating.

Compared
to other primates,|74964007|388073004
humans|278412004
have
extensive axillary hair|41118005|75703003|41118005|280911007
and
have
many odor producing sources,|103371008|260753009
in particular many apocrine glands.|2789006

In women,|224526002
the sense|106148006
of olfaction|397686008
is
strongest|260404005
around the time|410669006
of ovulation,|34008004
significantly stronger|260404005
than
during other phases|74964007|272108007
of the menstrual cycle|78456001
and
also stronger|260404005
than the sense|106148006
in males.[7]|248153007

Humans|278412004
can
detect|260373001
individuals|125676002|385435006
that
are
blood-related kin|87612001|272151006|87612001|262094002|119273009|272151006|119273009|262094002
(mothers|72705000
and
children|410601007|160499008
but
not husbands|127849001
and
wives|127850001
)
from olfaction.|397686008

Mothers|72705000
can
identify|7882003
by body odor|81917002
their biological children|75226009
but
not
their stepchildren.|86764008

Preadolescent children|410600008|410601007|410600008|160499008
can
olfactorily
detect|260373001
their full siblings|261015003|375005
but
not half-siblings|21093007
or
step siblings|398298007|375005
and
this
might
explain
incest avoidance|51347003
and
the Westermarck effect.|253861007

Babies|418119000
can
recognize
their mothers|72705000
by smell|397686008
and
mothers|72705000
and
other relatives|74964007|125677006
can
identify|7882003
a baby|418119000
by smell.[3]|397686008

Humans|278412004
have
few olfactory receptor cells|57176003|397686008|116647005|4421005|57176003|255349008|116647005|4421005
compared
to dogs|448771007
and
few functional olfactory receptor genes|57176003|40143009|397686008|116647005|67271001|57176003|40143009|255349008|116647005|67271001|57176003|246464006|397686008|116647005|67271001|57176003|246464006|255349008|116647005|67271001
compared
to rats.|371565004|371564000

This
is
in part|260726005
due|42752001
a reduction|58294000|260400001|289928003
of the size|277049003
of the snout|41127006
in order to
achieve
depth perception|251763006
as well as
other changes|74964007|243326001|74964007|263703002
related|272151006|262094002
to bipedalism.

However,
it
has
been
argued
that humans|278412004
may
have
larger brain areas|255509001|12738006|42798000|255509001|258335003|42798000|263768009|12738006|42798000|263768009|258335003|42798000
associated|47429007
with olfactory perception|397686008|81742003|255349008|81742003
compared
to other species.[6]|74964007|69658003

Joseph Jordania
has
suggested
that human body odor|279495008|103371008|281189005|103371008|278412004|81917002
played|300776002
a role
of aposematic olfactory|397686008|255349008
(warning display signal
)
in early hominids,|264499004|389213009
particularly
at night,|2546009
when
hominids|389213009
were
sleeping|258158006|248220008
in the open savannah.|56116003

As many predators
approach
their prey
against the wind,|308698004|90569008
the strong body odor|260404005|81917002
would
inform|410938009|223458004
predators
about the identity|247889000
and
the size|277049003
of the hominid group.|389213009|261586004|389213009|160481000|389213009|389109008

He
explained
the presence|386397008
of patches|36875001
of hair|386045008|119326000
in human armpits|278412004|422543003
and
genitals
by the evolutionary need to|410525008|103325001
produce
stronger body odor.|260404005|81917002

According to his suggestion,
body odor|81917002
lost
its survival value
after humans|278412004
developed
more advanced means|242762006|86005002|255586005
of safety
(controlled fire,|31509003|80032004|31509003|257195008
shelters,
effective weapons|255403003|312201009|254648000|312201009
)
,
and
therefore started disappearing,|385652002
gradually
becoming
an unwanted legacy
of our evolutionary past.[10]

Studies|110465008|224699009
have
suggested
that people|125676002
might
be
using|260676000
odor cues|103371008
associated|47429007
with the immune system to|116003000
select
mates.|262043009

Using|260676000
a brain imaging technique,|12738006|278395004|258335003|278395004
Swedish researchers
have
shown
that Homosexual|38628009
and
straight males' brains|262185006|248153007|12738006
respond
differently
to two odors|420797005|103371008
that
may
be
involved|248448006
in sexual arousal,|33105009|248762000
and
that
the Homosexual men|38628009|339947000
respond
in the same way|262126009
as straight women,|262185006|224526002
though
it
could
not
be
determined
whether
this
was
cause|134198009
or
effect.|253861007

The study|110465008|224699009
was
expanded|70955005
to
include|55919000
lesbian women|89217008|224526002
;
the results|394617004
were
consistent|385433004
with previous findings|9130008|404684003|9130008
meaning|255586005
that lesbian women|89217008|224526002
were
not
as responsive|80074009
to male identified odors,|248153007|7882003|103371008
while
their response
to female cues|248152002|224526002
was
similar
to straight males.|262185006|248153007

According to the researchers,
this research
suggests
a possible role|371930009|60022001
for human pheromones|278412004|5987007
in the biological basis|12893009|12893009|418836005
of sexual orientation.[12]|66621004

Several different odorous substances|261028005|263735002|103371008|105590001
released|68776005|129299003
by the body|279495008|123037004
cause|23981006|134198009
behavioral effects|844005|253861007
as
described
in the pheromone article.|5987007

Body odor|81917002
is
largely
influenced
by major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules.|70828002|290005005

These
are
genetically
determined
and
play|300776002
an important role
in immunity|58915005
of the organism.|410653004

The vomeronasal organ|56969001|361346007
contains|42504009
cells|4421005
sensitive|83185005
to MHC molecules|290005005
in a genotype-specific way.|69658003

Experiments
on animals|387961004
and
volunteers|160772005
have
shown
that potential sexual partners|30207005|225517006
tend
to
be
perceived|81742003
more attractive|242762006
if
their MHC composition
is
substantially different.|263735002

Married couples|160787000|87915002
are
more different regarding MHC genes|242762006|263735002|67271001
than
would
be
expected
by chance.

This behavior pattern|90275003
promotes
variability|255372005
of the immune system|116003000
of individuals|125676002|385435006
in the population,|385436007|389109008
thus
making
the population|385436007|389109008
more robust|242762006
against new diseases.|7147002|64572001

Another reason|410666004
may
be
to
prevent
inbreeding.[3]

East Asians|414978006
(Koreans,|38361009
Chinese,|297876005|33897005
and
Japanese|414551003
have
fewer apocrine sweat glands|57176003|127855006
compared
to people|125676002
of other descent,|74964007
and
the lack|41277001
of these glands|362884007
make
East Asians|414978006
less prone|276139006|1240000|263796003|1240000
to body odor.|81917002

The reduction|58294000|260400001|289928003
in body odor|81917002
and
sweating|161857006
may
be
due to adaptation|60783002|4452006
to colder|285686007|82272006|84162001
climates
by their ancient Northeast Asian ancestors.|414978006

Axillary odor|422543003|103371008
is
known to|36692007

by the ABCC11 gene|67271001
that also
codes
the type|261664005
of earwax one|41508009|421379005
has.

Most
of the population|385436007|389109008
secrete
"
wet|17461003
" earwax,|41508009
however,
East Asians|414978006
are
genetically predisposed
for the allele|9109004
that
codes
the "
dry|13880007
" type earwax,|261664005|41508009
associated|47429007
with a reduction|58294000|260400001|289928003
in axillary odor.|422543003|103371008

A study|110465008|224699009
by Martin _
et
al._
(2010
)
has
shown
that
the non-functional ABCC11 allele?predominant|42044006|9109004
amongst the East Asians|414978006
(80?95%
)?
affects|4065008
apocrine sweat glands|127855006
by reducing production|260400001
and
secretion|46242002
of odorant compounds commonly|62105006
found|404684003
in the perspiration|74616000|161857006
of other ancestral groups.[17]|74964007|261586004|74964007|160481000

Body odor|81917002
may
be
reduced|260400001
or
prevented|116699007
or
even
aggravated|162473008|410661009
by
using|260676000
deodorants,|373760002
antiperspirants,|373747008
disinfectants,|311942001
underarm liners,|422543003
triclosan,|387054001
special soaps|67995009|25780000
or
foams|421166008
with antiseptic plant|31006001
extracts|62972009
such as ribwort
and
liquorice,|398931007|31347007
chlorophyllin ointments|412117007|385101003
and
sprays topically,|55573003|421720008|419694003
and
chlorophyllin|412117007
supplements|373453009
internally.|260521003

Although
body odor|81917002
is
commonly
associated|47429007
with hygiene practices,|284779002
its presentation|246105001
can
be
affected|247591002|248448006
by changes|243326001|263703002
in diet|41829006
as well as
the other factors|74964007
discussed
above.[19]|261183002

The condition|260905004
can
be
known|36692007
medically
as
bromhidrosis,|65382006
apocrine bromhidrosis,|362938003|65382006
osmidrosis,|65382006
ozochrotia,|65382006
fetid sweat,|74616000|161857006
body smell|279495008|397686008|123037004|397686008
or
malodorous sweating.[20][21]|161857006

Osmidrosis|65382006
or
bromhidrosis|65382006
is
defined
by a foul odor|103371008
due to a water-rich environment|11713004|224166006|276339004|119318008|224166006|276339004
that
supports|9096001|243114000
bacteria,|409822003
which
is
caused|23981006|134198009
by an abnormally
increase|260366006
in perspiration|74616000|161857006
(hyperhidrosis.|312230002

This
can
be
particularly strong|260404005
when
it happens
in the axillary region|422543003
(underarms|422543003
).

In this case,|398241000
the condition|260905004
may
be
referred|439980006
to a axillary osmidrosis.[16]|422543003|65382006
