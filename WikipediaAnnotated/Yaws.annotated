"Bouba,|70647001

"[1]|260305007
and
"Pian"[2]|70647001
)
is
a tropical infection
of the skin,|119325001|39937001|181469002
bones|272673000|128530007
and
joints|39352004|81087007
caused|23981006|134198009
by the spirochete bacterium _Treponema pallidum pertenue_.|38732005|409822003|6246005|14738005|115169007|409822003|6246005|14738005|409822003|6246005|14738005|418489004|409822003|6246005|14738005

Other treponemal diseases|74964007
are
bejel|240688009
(_Treponema pallidum endemicum_|72904005
)
,
pinta|22064009
(_Treponema pallidum carateum_|14562002|14738005
)
,
and
syphilis|76272004
(_Treponema pallidum pallidum_|72904005
).

Examination|5880005
of ancient remains
has
led|88488004|236874000
to the suggestion
that yaws|70647001
has
affected hominids|247591002|389213009|248448006|389213009
for the last 1.5 million years.|258707000

The current name|15240007
is
believed to
be
of Carib origin,|255395001
"yaya" meaning sore.|255586005|247348008|255586005|279074008|255586005|410713007

It
is
believed to
have
originated
in tropical areas|42798000
of Africa,|223498002
and
spread|410677005
to other tropical areas|74964007|42798000
of the world
via immigration
and
slave trade.

Yaws|70647001
is
found|404684003
in humid tropical regions|17461003|410673009
in South America,|223504005
Africa,|223498002
Asia|223500001
and
Oceania.|223501002

Mass treatment campaigns|300848003|276239002|300848003|416118004|118538004|276239002|118538004|416118004
in the 1950s
reduced|260400001
the worldwide prevalence
from 50?150 million
to fewer|57176003
than 2.5 million|264655001
;
however
during the 1970s there
were
outbreaks|443684005
in south-east Asia|223585008
and
there
have
been
continued|255238004
sporadic cases|75741005|398241000|75741005|413769002
in South America.|223504005

It
is
unclear
how
many people worldwide|125676002
are
infected
at present.[4]|52101004|246105001

About three quarters|421291004
of people|125676002
affected|247591002|248448006
are
children|410601007|160499008
under 15 years|258707000
of age,|424144002
with the greatest incidence|4757001
in children 6-10 years old.[5]|410601007|258707000|70753007|160499008|258707000|70753007

The disease|64572001
is
transmitted|60117003|258150004
by skin-to-skin contact|119325001|11723008|119325001|70862002|39937001|11723008|39937001|70862002|181469002|11723008|181469002|70862002
with an infective lesion,
with the bacterium entering|409822003|417985001
through a pre-existing cut, bite|236874000|283396008|3404009|236874000|283396008|25272006|272113006|283396008|3404009|272113006|283396008|25272006
or
scratch.|53181008

Within ninety days|258703001
(
but
usually less
than a month|258706009|259036001
)
of infection
a painless|255350008
but
distinctive 'mother yaw'|49442000
appears
,
which
is
a painless nodule|255350008|27925004
which
enlarges|260376009|118452000
and
becomes
warty|57019003
in appearance.|386548000|255412001

Sometimes nearby 'daughter|66089001
yaws|70647001
' also
appear
simultaneously.|79970003

This primary stage|63161005|21191007|63161005|371508000|63161005|261612004|261424001|21191007|261424001|371508000|261424001|261612004
resolves
completely
within six months.|422218008|258706009

The secondary stage|2603003|21191007|2603003|371508000|2603003|261612004|81170007|21191007|81170007|371508000|81170007|261612004
occurs|272120004
months|258706009
to years later,|258707000
and
is
characterised
by widespread skin lesions|85333001|95324001
of varying appearance,|386548000|255412001
including|55919000
'crab yaws'|420975000|70647001|45776000|70647001|230029001|70647001
on the palms|107631008
and
soles|57999000
with desquamation.|271767006

These secondary lesions frequently|2603003|70232002|81170007|70232002
ulcerate|429040005
(
and
are
then highly infectious|75540009
)
,
but
heal|298005009
after six months|422218008|258706009
or
more.|242762006

About ten percent|23067006|118582008|420258001|118582008
of people then|125676002
go
on to
develop
tertiary disease|84965000|64572001
within five|421820001
to ten years|23067006|258707000|420258001|258707000
(
during which further secondary lesions|46053002|2603003|46053002|81170007
may
come
and
go
)
,
characterised
by widespread bone,|85333001|272673000|85333001|3138006|85333001|90780006|85333001|128530007
joint|39352004|81087007|302536002
and
soft tissue destruction,|181607009|64597002
which
may
include|55919000
extensive destruction|41118005|64597002
of the bone|272673000|3138006|90780006|128530007
and
cartilage|61496007
of the nose|260540009|181195007
(rhinopharyngitis mutilans|24078009
or
'gangosa'|24078009
).

Most often|4757001|70232002
the diagnosis|439401001
is
made clinically.

Dark field microscopy|255419005|255798002|117259009
of samples|123038009
taken|419652001
from early lesions|264499004
(particularly ulcerative lesions|429040005
)
may
show
the responsible organism.|394851003|410653004

Blood tests|252275004
such as VDRL,|7786006
Rapid Plasma Reagin (RPR)|19869000
and
TPHA
will
also
be
positive,|258758003|10828004
but
there
are
no current blood tests|15240007|252275004
which
distinguish
among the four treponematoses.[3]|421534005

Treatment|276239002|416118004
is
normally
by a single intramuscular injection|125681006|76601001|50607009|76601001
of penicillin,|373270004
or
by a course|288524001
of penicillin,|373270004
erythromycin|372694001
or
tetracycline tablets.|372809001|385055001|372809001|428673006|16355005|385055001|16355005|428673006|282831004|385055001|282831004|428673006

A single oral dose|125681006|260548002|277406006|125681006|260548002|408102007|50607009|260548002|277406006|50607009|260548002|408102007
of azithromycin|387531004
was
shown
to
be
as effective|255403003|254648000
as intramuscular penicillin.|76601001|373270004|76601001|255559005|373270004|255559005

Primary|63161005|261424001
and
secondary stage lesions|2603003|21191007|2603003|371508000|2603003|261612004|81170007|21191007|81170007|371508000|81170007|261612004
may
heal|298005009
completely,
but
the destructive changes|255303004|243326001|255303004|263703002
of tertiary yaws|88037009
are
largely irreversible.

The global prevalence|60132005
of this disease|64572001
and
the other endemic trematoses,|74964007
Bejel|240688009
and
Pinta,|22064009
was
reduced|260400001
by the Global Control|60132005|31509003
of Treponematoses
(TCP|129480005
)
programme
between 1952
and
1964
from about 50
to 150 million cases|398241000|413769002
to about 2.5 million
(
a 95 percent reduction|118582008|58294000|118582008|260400001|118582008|289928003
).

Following|255260001
the cessation
of this program yaws surveillance|70647001|225419007
and
treatment|276239002|416118004
became
a part|260726005
of primary health systems|63161005|263775005|246333005|261424001|263775005|246333005
of the effected countries.|253861007|223369002

However incomplete eradication|255599008|255609007
led|88488004|236874000
to a resurgence
of yaws|70647001
in 1970s
with the largest number|255509001|410680006|255509001|410681005|263768009|410680006|263768009|410681005
of case|398241000
found|404684003
in the Western Africa region.[4]|223498002|410673009

Yaws|70647001
is
a relatively easy disease|36203004|64572001
to eradicate.

Humans|278412004
are
likely|2931005
the only reservoir|50607009|257687008|420295001|257687008
of infection.

A single injection|125681006|28289002|125681006|385218009|125681006|129326001|50607009|28289002|50607009|385218009|50607009|129326001
of long-acting penicillin
or
other beta lactam antibiotic|74964007|409132008
cures
the disease|64572001
and
is
widely available|103328004
;[7]
and
the disease|64572001
is
highly|75540009
localised|255471002
making case|398241000
tracing|260405006
relatively easy.|36203004

In April 2012
WHO
decided
to
start|255395001
a new global campaign|7147002|60132005
for eradication
of yaws,|70647001
which
has
been
on the
WHO eradication
list
since 2011.

According to the official roadmap
the elimination|63911002
should
be
achieved
by 2020.

So
far,|46053002
this
appears
to
have
met|229057006
with some success,|385669000
since
no cases|398241000|413769002
have
been
seen
in India since 2004.[7][9]|223600005

Certification
for disease free status|64572001|37837009|263490005
requires
an absence|2667000|418560003
of the disease|64572001
for
at least 5 years.|276139006|258707000|263796003|258707000

In India|223600005
this happened
on 19 September 2011.

In 1996 there
were
3,571 yaws cases|260313008|70647001|398241000|260313008|70647001|413769002
in India|223600005
;
in 1997
after a serious elimination effort|42745003|63911002|19487008
began|255395001
the number|410680006|410681005
of cases|398241000|413769002
fell|1912002
to 735.

By 2003
the number|410680006|410681005
of cases|398241000|413769002
were
46.

The last clinical case|58147004|398241000
in India|223600005
was
reported|229059009|223458004
in 2003
and
the last latent case|44104002|398241000
in 2006.[10]
