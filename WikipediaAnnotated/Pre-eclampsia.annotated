*Pre-eclampsia|15394000

*
or

*preeclampsia|15394000
*

is
a medical condition|74188005|260905004
in which hypertension|38341003
arises|68727004
in pregnancy|289908002
(gestational hypertension|48194001|237279007
in association|263534001|272151006
with significant amounts|386134007|107651007
of protein|88878007
in the urine.|78014005

Pre-eclampsia|15394000
is
a set
of symptoms
rather than
any causative factor,
and
there
are
many different causes|260396001|263735002|134198009
for the condition.|260905004

It
appears
likely|2931005
that there
are
substances|105590001
from the placenta|62669004|181455002
that
can
cause|23981006|134198009
endothelial dysfunction|27168002|386585008
in the maternal blood vessels|72705000|59820001
of susceptible women.|131196009|224526002

While
blood pressure elevation|24184005
is
the most visible sign|4757001|24054004|72670004
of the disease,|64572001
it
involves|248448006
generalized damage|60132005|37782003
to the maternal endothelium,|72705000|27168002
kidneys,|64033007|17373004
and
liver,|10200004|181268008
with the release|58000006|68776005|258760001|129299003|115956009
of vasoconstrictive factors
being
secondary|2603003|81170007
to the original damage.|19535007|37782003

Pre-eclampsia|15394000
may
develop
from 20 weeks' gestation
(
it
is
considered early onset|264499004|77374008
before 32 weeks,|258705008
which
is
associated|47429007
with an increased morbidity.|35105006|260366006

Its progress|385651009
differs
among patients|116154003
;
most cases|398241000|413769002
are
diagnosed|439401001
before|236874000|421718005
labor|289909005|261041009
typically
would
begin.|255395001

Pre-eclampsia|15394000
may
also
occur|272120004
up to six weeks|422218008|258705008
after delivery.|236973005|118215003

Apart from Caesarean section|11466000
and
induction|16404004
of labor|289909005|261041009
(
and
therefore delivery|236973005|118215003
of the placenta,|62669004|181455002
there
is
no known cure.|36692007

It
is
the most common|4757001|72906007
of the dangerous pregnancy complications|90821003
;
it
may
affect|4065008
both the mother|72705000
and
fetus.[1]|83418008

Pre-eclampsia|15394000
is
diagnosed|439401001
when
a pregnant woman|255409004
develops
high blood pressure|38341003
(two separate readings|420797005|263869007|50360004
taken|419652001
at least six hours apart|276139006|422218008|258702006|263796003|422218008|258702006
of 140
or
more
in systolic blood pressure|271649006
and/or
90|264705001|264703008
or
more
in diastolic blood pressure|271650006
)
_
and
_ 300 mg|427264006
of protein|88878007
in a 24-hour urine sample|276833005
(proteinuria.|29738008

A rise
in baseline blood pressure (BP)|263682001|87612001|263682001|119273009|75367002|392570002|386536003
of 30 mmHg|304621005
systolic|111973004
or
15 mmHg|304621005
diastolic,|90892000
while
not
meeting|229057006
the absolute criteria|56136002
of 140/90,|264705001|264703008
is
still
considered important to
note
,
but
is
not
considered
diagnostic.|439401001|261004008

"Severe pre-eclampsia"|46764007
involves|248448006
a BP
over 160/110[2][3]
with additional symptoms.|260364009

Swelling|423666004|442672001
or
edema|423666004
(especially
in the hands|85562004
and
face|89545001|302549007
)
was
originally
considered
an important sign|72670004
for a diagnosis|439401001
of pre-eclampsia,|15394000
but
in current medical practice only hypertension [4]|15240007|74188005|38341003
and
proteinuria|29738008
are
necessary
for a diagnosis.|439401001

Pitting edema|284521000
(unusual swelling,|423666004|442672001
particularly
of the hands,|85562004
feet,|56459004|259051005
or
face,|89545001|302549007
notable
by leaving|7771000|90737002
an indentation|82448003
when
pressed
on
)
can
be
significant,|386134007
and
should
be
reported|229059009|223458004
to a health care provider.

Although
eclampsia|15938005
is
potentially fatal|399166001
(2%|260306008
of cases|398241000|413769002
)
,
pre-eclampsia|15394000
is
often asymptomatic,|70232002|84387000
and
so
its detection
depends
on signs|72670004
or
investigations.|386053000

Nonetheless,
one symptom|421379005
is
crucially important
because
it
is
often|70232002
misinterpreted
:
epigastric pain|79922009
may
be
confused|286933003
with heartburn,|16331000
a common problem|72906007|55607006
of pregnancy.|289908002

In general, none|60132005|260413007
of the signs|72670004
of pre-eclampsia|15394000
are
specific,|69658003
and
even convulsions
in pregnancy|289908002
are
more likely to|242762006|2931005
have
causes|134198009
other than eclampsia|15938005
in modern practice.

Diagnosis,|439401001
therefore,
depends
on finding|404684003
a coincidence|68405009
of several pre-eclamptic features,|261028005|15394000
the final proof|42796001|229796008
being
their regression|48386003
after delivery.|236973005|118215003

Some women|224526002
develop
high blood pressure|38341003
without proteinuria|29738008
(protein|88878007
in urine|78014005
)
,
which
is
called pregnancy-induced hypertension (* * PIH * *)|48194001
or
gestational hypertension.|48194001|237279007

Both
pre-eclampsia|15394000
and
PIH|70392002
are
regarded
as very serious conditions|260358002|42745003|260905004
and
require
careful monitoring|302805002
of mother|72705000
and
fetus.|83418008

Blood test|252275004
for quantification
of the substances placental growth factor (PlGF)|105590001|62669004|81286007|105590001|388033005|81286007
and
soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase-1 (sFLT - 1)|43305003
in late first|260383002|255216001|260383002|232714002
or
second trimester|255247007
appear
to
predict
early-onset pre-eclampsia|264499004|77374008|15394000
with a high sensitivity|75540009|35209006|75540009|365705006|371879000|35209006|371879000|365705006
and
specificity.|69658003

Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) family proteins|59820001|27168002|81286007|35359004|88878007
do
not
have
sufficient statistical power to accurately|51117008|33300005
predict
late-onset pre-eclampsia,|260383002|77374008|15394000
but
may
be
useful
in detection
of early-onset pre-eclampsia.[5]|264499004|77374008|15394000

In November 2011,
a new test|7147002|269814003|7147002|7147002|272393004
was
announced
that
involves|248448006
checking patients' urine|360160009|116154003|78014005
for specific cells|69658003|4421005
called
podocytes.

Out of the 300 women|224526002
tested|272393004
,
all
the women|224526002
who
went
on to
have
pre-eclampsia|15394000
were
found|404684003
to
have
podocytes
in their urine,|78014005
whilst
none|260413007
of the women|224526002
who
had
a normal pregnancy,|72892002
or
who
suffered
from pregnancy-induced hypertension,|48194001
tested positive|272393004|258758003|272393004|10828004
for podocytes.[6][7]

Pre-eclampsia|15394000
affects|4065008
approximately 6-8%|26175008
of all pregnancies worldwide,|289908002
[8]
with onset|77374008
of symptoms
in the late second|260383002|81170007|260383002|257997001|260383002|288495006
or
third trimester,|255248002
most commonly
after the 32nd week.|258705008|259038000

Some women|224526002
will
experience
pre-eclampsia|15394000
as early|264499004
as 20 weeks,|258705008
though
this
is
rare.|84638005|103356009

It
is
much more common|242762006|72906007|4757001|72906007
in women|224526002
who
are
pregnant|77386006|127362006
for the first time,|255216001|410669006|232714002|410669006
[9]
and
its frequency|260864003|272123002
drops|426684005|404218003
significantly
in second pregnancies.|22879003

While
change|243326001|263703002
of paternity|1042002
in a subsequent pregnancy|255260001|289908002
is
now
thought|88952004
to lower risk|261122009|30207005
except
in those with a family history|20401003|57177007|421463005|57177007
of hypertensive pregnancy,|289908002
[10]
since
increasing|260369004
maternal age|13506008
raises|260399008
risk,|30207005
[11]
it
has
been
difficult to|52925006
evaluate
how significant paternity|386134007|1042002
change|243326001|263703002
actually
is
and
studies|110465008|224699009
are
providing conflicting data|15863006
on this point.

Pre-eclampsia|15394000
is
also more common|72906007
in women|224526002
who
have
preexisting hypertension,|38341003
diabetes,|73211009
autoimmune diseases|85828009
such as lupus,|10528009|200938002|55464009|200936003
various inherited thrombophilias|256220008|255404009|76612001
such as Factor V Leiden,|60208008
renal disease,|90708001
women|224526002
with a family history|57177007
of pre-eclampsia,|15394000
obese women,|414915002|224526002
and
women|224526002
with a multiple gestation|16356006
(twins|11286003
or
multiple birth.|45384004

The single most significant risk|125681006|386134007|30207005|50607009|386134007|30207005
for developing pre-eclampsia|15394000
is
having
had
pre-eclampsia|15394000
in a previous pregnancy.|127362006

Pre-eclampsia|15394000
may
also
occur|272120004
in the immediate post-partum period.|88694003|255410009|49499008|255410009

This
is
referred to|439980006
as
"postpartum pre-eclampsia".|303063000|236874000|303063000|272113006|255410009|15394000

The most dangerous time|4757001|410669006
for the mother|72705000
is
the 24?48 hours postpartum|123027009|255410009|259029002|255410009|255249005|255410009
and
careful attention|6769007
should
be
paid
to pre-eclampsia signs|15394000|72670004
and
symptoms.[12]

The pre-eclampsia syndrome|15394000
is
thought|88952004
in many cases to|398241000|413769002
be
caused|23981006|134198009
by a shallowly implanted placenta|40388003|62669004|40388003|181455002
which
becomes
hypoxic,|389086002
leading|236874000
to an immune reaction|255386009|263851003
characterized
by secretion|46242002
of upregulated inflammatory mediators|49352002
from the placenta,|62669004|181455002
and
acting
on the vascular endothelium.|59820001|27168002

The shallow implantation|71861002|25602002
is
thought|88952004
to stem
from the maternal immune system's response|72705000|35024006|246333005
to the placenta|62669004|181455002
and
refers|439980006
to evidence|18669006
suggesting
a lack|41277001
of established immunological tolerance|263748003|37523008|228432001|263748003|37523008|77472006|263748003|37523008|71412006|385645004|37523008|228432001|385645004|37523008|77472006|385645004|37523008|71412006
in pregnancy.|289908002

This results|394617004
in an immune response|35024006
against paternal antigens|224944003|7120007
from the fetus|83418008
and
its placenta.|62669004|181455002

In some cases|398241000|413769002
of pre-eclampsia|15394000
it
is
thought|88952004
that
the mother|72705000
lacks|41277001
the receptors|116647005
for the proteins|88878007
the placenta|62669004|181455002
is
using|260676000
to
downregulate
the maternal immune system's response|72705000|35024006|246333005
to it.

This view|246516004
is
also consistent|385433004
with evidence|18669006
showing
many miscarriages to|17369002
be
an immunological disorder|37523008|64572001
where the mother's immune system "|72705000|116003000
unleashes
a destructive attack|255303004|217315002|255303004|216299002
on the tissues|85756007
of the developing child".[15]|410601007|160499008

In many cases|398241000|413769002
of the pre-eclampsia syndrome,|15394000
however,
the maternal response|72705000
to the placenta|62669004|181455002
appears
to
have
allowed
for normal implantation.|17621005|71861002|17621005|25602002|258744000|71861002|258744000|25602002

It
is
possible|371930009|60022001
that women|224526002
with higher baseline levels|75540009|258395000|371879000|258395000
of inflammation stemming|257552002
from underlying conditions|260905004
such as chronic hypertension|90734009|38341003
or
autoimmune disease|85828009
may
have
less tolerance|276139006|228432001|276139006|77472006|276139006|71412006|263796003|228432001|263796003|77472006|263796003|71412006
for the inflammatory burden
of pregnancy.|289908002

If severe, pre-eclampsia|46764007
progresses|385651009
to _fulminant pre-eclampsia,|15394000
_
with headaches,|25064002
visual disturbances,|63102001
and
epigastric pain,|79922009
and
further|46053002
to the HELLP syndrome|95605009
and
eclampsia.|15938005

Placental abruption|405736009
is
associated|47429007
with hypertensive pregnancies.|289908002

These
are
life-threatening conditions|224130005|260905004
for both
the developing baby|418119000
and
the mother.|72705000

Many theories|260396001
have
attempted
to
explain
why pre-eclampsia|15394000
arises|68727004
,
and
have
linked
the syndrome
to the presence|386397008
of the following|255260001
:

The current understanding|15240007|66216009
of the syndrome
is
as a two-stage process,|420797005|21191007|415178003|420797005|371508000|415178003|420797005|261612004|415178003
with a highly variable first stage|75540009|255372005|258215001
which
predisposes
the placenta|62669004|181455002
to hypoxia,|389086002
followed|367409002
by the release|58000006|68776005|258760001|129299003|115956009
of soluble factors
which
result|394617004
in many|260396001
of the other observed phenomena.|74964007

Many
of the older theories|70753007
can
be
subsumed
under this umbrella,
as
the soluble factors
have
been
shown
to

endothelial cell injury,|45709008

inflammation,|257552002
etc.

Underlying|255546002
maternal susceptibility|72705000|76522002|72705000|118588007
to the damage|37782003
is
likely|2931005
implicated
as well...|20572008

Although
much
research
into the etiology|134198009
and
mechanism|257544000
of pre-eclampsia|15394000
has
taken|419652001
place|257557008|421066005
,
its exact pathogenesis|303109001
remains
uncertain.|64957009

Some
studies|110465008|224699009
support notions|9096001|243114000
of inadequate blood supply|71978007|87612001|425398004|71978007|119273009|425398004
to the placenta making|62669004|181455002
it
release|58000006|68776005|258760001|129299003|115956009
particular hormones|87568004
or
chemical agents|441900009|260872001
that,
in mothers|72705000
predisposed
to the condition,|260905004
leads|88488004|236874000
to
damage|37782003
of the endothelium|27168002
(lining|50009006
of blood vessels|59820001
)
,
alterations
in metabolism,|47722004
inflammation,|257552002
and
other possible reactions.[1]|74964007|371930009|263851003|74964007|60022001|263851003

Abnormalities|276654001
in the maternal immune system|72705000|116003000
and
insufficiency|87828008
of gestational immune tolerance|255402008|77472006
seem
to
play|300776002
major roles|255603008
in pre-eclampsia.|15394000

One|421379005
of the main differences|63161005|263735002
found|404684003
in pre-eclampsia|15394000
is
a shift|9546005
toward Th1 responses
and
the production
of IFN-?.

The origin|255395001
of IFN-?
is
not clearly
identified|7882003
and
could
be
the natural killer cells|259717003
of the uterus,|35039007|181452004
the placental dendritic cells|62669004|388033005
modulating|261019009
responses
of T helper cells,|29594005
alterations
in synthesis|11798007
of
or
response
to regulatory molecules,|290005005
or
changes|243326001|263703002
in the function|246464006
of regulatory T cells|57184004
in pregnancy.|289908002

Aberrant immune responses|260980007|35024006
promoting
pre-eclampsia|15394000
may
also
be
due to an altered fetal allorecognition
or
to inflammatory triggers.

It
has
been
documented|397934002
that fetal cells|258748002
such as fetal erythroblasts|84227004
as well as
cell-free fetal DNA|4421005|37837009|24851008|362837007|37837009|24851008
are
increased|35105006|260366006
in the maternal circulation|72705000|413854007
in women|224526002
who
develop
pre-eclampsia.|15394000

These findings|404684003
have
given|419582001
rise
to the hypothesis
that pre-eclampsia|15394000
is
a disease process|64572001|415178003
by which
a placental lesion|62669004|388033005
such as hypoxia|389086002
allows
increased fetal material|35105006|260769002|260366006|260769002
into maternal circulation|72705000|413854007
that
leads|88488004|236874000
to an immune response|35024006
and
endothelial damage ultimately|27168002|37782003
resulting|42752001
in pre-eclampsia|15394000
and
eclampsia.|15938005

Some studies|110465008|224699009
suggest
that hypoxia|389086002
resulting|42752001
from inadequate perfusion|71978007|88058003
upregulates
sFlt-1,
a VEGF
and
PlGF antagonist,|58516001
leading|236874000
to a damaged maternal endothelium|37782003|72705000|27168002
and
restriction|263856008
of placental growth.|62669004|388033005

In addition,|260364009
endoglin,|103160002
a TGF-beta antagonist,|52095000|58516001|260989008|58516001
is
elevated|75540009
in pregnant women|255409004
who
develop
pre-eclampsia.|15394000

Soluble endoglin|103160002
is
likely|2931005
upregulated
by the placenta|62669004|181455002
in response
to an upregulation
of cell-surface endoglin|4421005|410678000|103160002|362837007|410678000|103160002
produced
by the maternal immune system,|72705000|116003000
although
there
is
also
the potential|30207005
that sEng
is
produced
by the maternal endothelium.|72705000|27168002

Levels|258395000
of
both
sFlt-1
and
sEng increase|260366006
as severity|272141005
of disease increases,|64572001|260366006
with levels|258395000
of sEng surpassing levels|258395000
of sFlt-1
in HELLP syndrome cases.|95605009|398241000|95605009|413769002

Recent data|6493001
indicate|410535002
that Gadd45a stress signaling|262188008|38952000
regulates
elevated sFlt-1 expression|75540009|10012005
in pre-eclampsia.[24]|15394000

Both
sFlt-1
and
sEng
are
upregulated
in all pregnant women|255409004
to some extent,|255590007
supporting|9096001|243114000
the idea|363878000
that hypertensive disease|38341003
in pregnancy|289908002
is
a normal pregnancy adaptation gone awry.|72892002|60783002|72892002|4452006

As natural killer cells|259717003
are
intimately
involved|248448006
in placentation|112067000
and
as placentation|112067000
involves|248448006
a degree|258395000|246173007
of maternal immune tolerance|72705000|77472006
for a foreign placenta|62669004|181455002
which
requires
maternal resources|72705000
for its support,|9096001|243114000
it
is
not
surprising
that
the maternal immune system|72705000|116003000
might
respond
more negatively|242762006
to the arrival
of some placentae|62669004
under certain circumstances,|17162000
such as a placenta|62669004|181455002
which
is
more invasive|242762006|10179008
than normal.|17621005|258744000

Initial maternal rejection|884001|72705000|232714002|72705000
of the placental cytotrophoblasts|62669004|6450001|388033005|6450001
may
be
the cause|134198009
of the inadequately
remodeled
spiral arteries|63879006|51114001|63879006|11527006
in those cases|398241000|413769002
of pre-eclampsia|15394000
associated|47429007
with shallow implantation,|71861002|25602002
leading|236874000
to downstream hypoxia|103365002|389086002
and
the appearance|386548000|255412001
of maternal symptoms|72705000
in response
to upregulated sFlt-1
and
sEng.

Pre-eclampsia|15394000
can
mimic
and
be
confused|286933003
with many other diseases,|74964007|64572001
including|55919000
chronic hypertension,|90734009|38341003
chronic renal disease,|46177005|236425005
primary seizure disorders,|56416009|91175000|63161005|313307000|261424001|313307000
gallbladder|28231008|181269000
and
pancreatic disease,|3855007
immune|255386009
or
thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura,|78129009
antiphospholipid syndrome|26843008
and
hemolytic-uremic syndrome.|111407006

It
must
always
be
considered
a possibility
in any pregnant woman|255409004
beyond 20 weeks|258705008
of gestation.|289908002

It
is
particularly difficult to|52925006
diagnose|439401001
when
preexisting disease|64572001
such as hypertension|38341003
is
present.[25]|52101004|246105001

Eclampsia|15938005
can
occur|272120004
after the onset|77374008
of pre-eclampsia.|15394000

Eclampsia,|15938005
which
is
a more serious condition,|242762006|42745003|260905004
complicates|255302009
1
in 2000 maternities
in the United Kingdom|223860005
and
carries|288345009
a maternal mortality|59283008
of 1.8 percent.|260305007|118582008

The HELLP syndrome|95605009
is
more common, probably about 1|242762006|72906007
in 500 maternities,
but
may
be
as
dangerous
as eclampsia|15938005
itself.

These two major maternal crises|420797005|255603008|72705000|32937002
can
present|52101004|246105001
unheralded
by prodromal signs|72670004
of pre-eclampsia.|15394000

Cerebral hemorrhage|73020009|274100004
is
a lesion
that
can
kill|248007002
with pre-eclampsia|15394000
or
eclampsia.|15938005

In that cerebral hemorrhage|73020009|274100004
is
a known complication|36692007|116223007|36692007|263718001
of severe hypertension|24484000|38341003
in other contexts,|74964007|263491009
it
must
be
assumed
that
this
is
a major predisposing factor|255603008
in this situation,
although
this
has
not
been
proven.|277025001

Adult respiratory distress syndrome|67782005
appears
to
have
become
more common,|242762006|72906007
it
is
not
known|36692007
whether
this
is
a consequence|103332005
of modern methods|260686004|272394005
of respiratory support|258162000|9096001|258162000|243114000|449071006|9096001|449071006|243114000

of the disease|64572001
itself.

Uric acid levels|1710001|258395000|86228006|258395000

help
to
predict
maternal complications|72705000|116223007
among patients|116154003
with pre-eclampsia|15394000
according to a systematic review|415300000

decision analysis.|272389005

In this study,|110465008|224699009
the sensitivity|35209006|365705006
was
68%|264697007

In this study|110465008|224699009
which
assumed
a prevalence
of maternal complications|72705000|116223007
was

or
lower risk|261122009|30207005
of maternal complications|72705000|116223007
).

In their clinical decision analysis,|58147004|272389005
they
presumed
initially|884001
a distress ratio|69328002|118586006
of 10
(
defined
as
being
the expected distress|69328002
of severe complications|24484000|116223007

as 10
times worse|230993007|390772001|231877006
than the expected distress|69328002
of a caesarean section|11466000
)
,
and
under these assumptions,
they
concluded
that there
would
be
the least expected distress|276139006|69328002|263796003|69328002
from
using|260676000

for eclampsia|15938005

dangerous
to the health|263775005

The reason|410666004

known|36692007
;
research
supports|9096001|243114000
speculation

the risk|30207005

to such
a degree|258395000|246173007

maternal|72705000
and
fetal mortality|409651001
among pregnancy patients|289908002|116154003
with hypertension|38341003
as
compared
to placebo
according to a randomized controlled trial.|31509003|110465008

Overall,
after
three weeks|421291004|258705008
of treatment,|276239002|416118004
mean arterial pressure|6797001
was
lower|261122009
in the isradipine group,|386862002|261586004|386862002|160481000|386862002|389109008
but
when
compared
with the placebo group,|261586004|160481000|389109008
the difference|263735002
in mean arterial pressure|6797001
did
not
have
statistical significance.|386134007

After treatment|276239002|416118004
with isradipine,|386862002
those patients|116154003
with no proteinuria|29738008
experienced
a decrease|260400001|260370003
of
between 8.5
and
11.3 mmHg,|304621005
whereas
those
with proteinuria|29738008
experienced
about only 1 mmHg difference|304621005|263735002
in systolic blood pressure.|271649006

Those
treated|28995006
with placebo
in
both
groups|261586004|160481000
did
not
experience
much
change|243326001|263703002
in systolic blood pressure,|271649006
regardless of proteinuria|29738008
being
present|52101004|246105001
or
not.

Therefore,
the authors|308004006
concluded
proteinuric patients|116154003
may
respond
differently
from nonproteinuric patients|116154003
to this treatment,|276239002|416118004
where
the nonproteinuric patients|116154003
responded
the most|4757001
to treatment|276239002|416118004
with isradipine.|386862002

Labetolol|372750000

often|70232002
the antihypertensives|372586001
of choice
for eclampsia|15938005
or
pre-eclampsia|15394000
according to the CHEST 2007 study_[clarification|261179002|110465008|261179002|224699009

as
it
has

The target blood pressure|75367002|392570002|386536003
has
been
proposed
to
be
140-160 mmHg|304621005
systolic|111973004
and
90-105 mmHg|264705001|304621005|264703008|304621005
diastolic,|90892000
although
some sources|260753009
recommend
lower values.[34]|261122009

In some cases,|398241000|413769002
women|224526002
with pre-eclampsia|15394000
or

as

the use|277889008|419385000
of diazepam|387264003

phenytoin.|387220006

Evidence|18669006
for the use|277889008|419385000
of magnesium sulfate|387202002
came
from the international MAGPIE study.|43428003|110465008|43428003|224699009

are
additional risks|260364009|30207005
to the baby|418119000

Studies|110465008|224699009
of protein/calorie supplementation|373687007|258790008|88878007|226280007
have
found|404684003
no effect|253861007

Studies|110465008|224699009
conducted|844005
on the effect|253861007
of supplementation
with antioxidants
such as vitamin C|46123006

found|404684003
no change|243326001|263703002

A study|110465008|224699009
giving|419582001
calcium supplementation|5540006
in women|224526002
with low-calcium diets|12631007
found|404684003
no change|243326001|263703002
in pre-eclampsia rates|15394000
but
did
find
a decrease|260400001|260370003
in the rate
of severe preeclamptic complications.|24484000|116223007

Low selenium status|62482003|22038003|263490005|371880002|22038003|263490005

associated|47429007
with higher incidence|75540009|371879000
of pre-eclampsia.[41][42]|15394000

Aspirin supplementation|387458008
is
still
being
evaluated
as to dosage,|277406006
timing,|246512002
and
population|385436007|389109008
and
may
provide
a slight preventative benefit|255510006|255604002
in some women|224526002
;
however,
significant research|386134007
has
been
done
on aspirin|387458008
and
the results thus far|394617004|46053002
are
unimpressive.[43]

There
is
insufficient evidence to|71978007|18669006|423437008|18669006
recommend
either
exercise[44]|61686008
or
bedrest[45]|225316001|17535004
as preventative measures|246445000|367346004
of pre-eclampsia.|15394000

Many studies|260396001|110465008|260396001|224699009
have
also
suggested
the importance
of a woman's immunological tolerance|224526002|37523008|228432001|224526002|37523008|77472006|224526002|37523008|71412006
to her baby's father,|418119000|66839005
whose genes|67271001
are
present|52101004|246105001
in the young fetus|84422007|84422007|83418008
and
its placenta|62669004|181455002
and
which
may
pose
a challenge
to her immune system.|116003000

As the theory
is
further|46053002
investigated,|116698004
[47] researchers
are
increasingly
studying|110465008|224699009
the importance
of a woman's continued exposure|224526002|255238004|71677004|224526002|255238004|24932003
to her partner's semen|262043009|264337003|262043009|6993007
as early|264499004
as several years|261028005|258707000
before conception.|13693004

One study|421379005|110465008|421379005|224699009
published
in the American Journal
of Obstetrics|408470005
and
Gynecology|394586005|83685006
involved|248448006
several hundreds|261028005
of women|224526002
and
found|404684003
that "women|224526002
with a short period|248967002
of cohabitation|38070000
(less
than 4 months|260308009|258706009
)
who
used|394850002
barrier methods|225370004
for contraception|13197004
had
a substantially elevated risk|75540009|30207005
for the development|278923009
of pre-eclampsia|15394000
compared
with women|224526002
with more|242762006
than 12 months|258706009
of cohabitation|38070000
before conception".|13693004

However,
the results|394617004
from a study|110465008|224699009
conducted|844005
in 2004
show
that
the theory
is
still
not conclusive.

In
that study,|110465008|224699009
the researchers
found|404684003
that
after
adjustment|410616005|410617001
and
stratification,
the effect|253861007
of barrier contraceptive use|417122000|277889008|417122000|419385000|348649005|277889008|348649005|419385000
on the development|278923009
of pre-eclampsia|15394000
had
disappeared
,
with
both
arms|40983000
having
identical rates|20323000
of pre-eclampsia.|15394000

Although
the study|110465008|224699009
has
since
been
criticized
for its subjective adjustment|255362007|410616005|255362007|410617001
of data,
it
remains
important
because
it
demonstrates
that there
is
still
some contention
over the degree|258395000|246173007
to which failure|76797004
of tolerance induction|228432001|16404004|77472006|16404004|71412006|16404004
can
be
attributed|246061005
to prior exposure|236874000|71677004|236874000|24932003
to the partner's sperm.|262043009|6789008

Continued exposure|255238004|71677004|255238004|24932003
to a partner's semen|262043009|264337003|262043009|6993007
has
a strong protective effect|260404005|253861007
against pre-eclampsia,|15394000
largely
due to the absorption
of several immune modulating factors|261028005|106181007|261019009
present|52101004|246105001
in seminal fluid.[50][51]|6993007

Long periods|255511005|259037005
of sexual cohabitation|365952006|38070000
with the same partner fathering|262126009|262043009|66839005
a woman's child significantly|224526002|410601007|224526002|160499008
decreased|1250004|260400001|260371004
her chances
of suffering pre-eclampsia.|15394000

As
one early|421379005|264499004
study|110465008|224699009
described, "
although
pre-eclampsia|15394000
is
a disease|64572001
of first pregnancies,|127364007
the protective effect|253861007
of multiparity|28079008
is
lost
with change|243326001|263703002
of partner".|262043009

The study also|110465008|224699009
concluded
that
although
women|224526002
with changing partners|243326001|262043009|263703002|262043009
are
strongly
advised|424900004
to
use|277889008|419385000
condoms to
prevent
sexually transmitted diseases,|8098009
"
a certain period|17162000|259037005
of sperm exposure|6789008|71677004|6789008|24932003
within a stable relation,|58158008|125677006
when
pregnancy|289908002
is
aimed
for,
is
associated|47429007
with protection
against pre-eclampsia".[52]|15394000

Several other studies|261028005|110465008|261028005|224699009
have
since
investigated|116698004
the strongly decreased incidence|1250004|260400001|260371004
of pre-eclampsia|15394000
in women|224526002
who
had
received blood transfusions
from their partner,|262043009
those
with long,|255511005
preceding|236874000
histories|392521001
of sex|258139002|365952006|263495000|70256003|57312000
without barrier contraceptives,|417122000
and
in women|224526002
who
had
been
regularly
performing|398166005
fellatio,|21312008
[53][54]
with one study concluding "induction|421379005|110465008|16404004|421379005|224699009|16404004
of allogeneic tolerance|228432001|77472006|71412006
to the paternal human leukocyte antigen (HLA) molecules|224944003|47038001|290005005
of the fetus|83418008
may
be
crucial.

Data
collected
strongly
suggest
that exposure,|71677004|24932003
and
especially oral exposure|260548002|71677004|260548002|24932003
to soluble HLA|47038001
from semen|264337003|6993007
can
lead|88488004
to transplantation tolerance."[54]|263903005|228432001|263903005|77472006|263903005|71412006

According to the theory,
the fetus|83418008
and
placenta|62669004|181455002
both
contain|42504009
"foreign" proteins|88878007
from paternal genes,|224944003|67271001
but
regular,|17854005
preceding|236874000
and
coincident exposure|68405009|71677004|68405009|24932003
to the father's semen|66839005|264337003|66839005|6993007
may
promote
immune acceptance|255386009
and
subsequent implantation,|255260001|71861002|255260001|25602002
a process|415178003
which
is
significantly
supported|9096001|243114000
by
as
many
as 93 currently|15240007
identified|7882003
immune|255386009
regulating
factors
in seminal fluid.[13][46]|6993007

Having
already
noted
the importance
of a woman's immunological tolerance|224526002|37523008|228432001|224526002|37523008|77472006|224526002|37523008|71412006
to her baby's paternal genes,|418119000|224944003|67271001
several Dutch reproductive biologists|261028005|9533000|72327007
decided
to
take|419652001
their
research
a step further.|398298007|46053002

Consistent|385433004
with the fact
that human immune systems|278412004|116003000
tolerate
things
better|3442003
when
they
enter|417985001
the body|279495008|123037004
via the mouth,|74262004|123851003|21082005|181220002
the Dutch researchers|9533000
conducted|844005
a series|13039001
of studies|110465008|224699009
that
confirmed|59156000
a surprisingly strong correlation|260404005
between a diminished incidence|1250004
of pre-eclampsia|15394000
and
a woman's practice|224526002
of oral sex,|260548002|258139002|260548002|365952006|260548002|263495000|260548002|70256003|260548002|57312000
and
noted
that
the protective effects|253861007
were
strongest|260404005
if
she
swallowed|54731003
her partner's semen.|262043009|264337003|262043009|6993007

The researchers
concluded
that
while
any exposure|71677004|24932003
to a partner's semen|262043009|264337003|262043009|6993007
during sexual activity|365952006
appears
to
decrease|260400001|260370003
a woman's chances|224526002
for the various immunological disorders|256220008|37523008|64572001
that
can
occur|272120004
during pregnancy,|289908002
immunological tolerance|37523008|228432001|37523008|77472006|37523008|71412006
could
be
most quickly|4757001
established|263748003|385645004
through oral introduction|260548002|107733003
and
gastrointestinal absorption|38597004
of semen.|264337003|6993007

Recognizing
that
some
of the studies potentially|110465008|224699009
included|55919000
the presence|386397008
of confounding factors,
such as the possibility
that women|224526002
who regularly
perform|398166005

engage|54986009
in more frequent intercourse,|242762006|70232002|258139002
the researchers also
noted
that,
either
way,
"
the data still overwhelmingly
supports|9096001|243114000
the main theory"|63161005
behind all
their studies?|110465008|224699009
that repeated exposure|27582007|71677004|27582007|24932003
to semen|264337003|6993007
establishes|263748003|385645004
the maternal immunological tolerance|72705000|37523008|228432001|72705000|37523008|77472006|72705000|37523008|71412006
necessary
for a safe
and
successful pregnancy.[51][55]|385669000|289908002|264691008

A team
from the University of Adelaide|224871002
has
also
investigated|116698004
to
see|281004000
if men|339947000
who
have
fathered pregnancies|66839005|289908002
which
have
ended|385656004|422117008
in miscarriage|17369002
or
pre-eclampsia|15394000
had
low seminal levels|62482003|258395000|371880002|258395000
of critical immune modulating factors|106181007|261019009
such as TGF-Beta.|52095000|260989008

The team
has
found|404684003
that certain men,|17162000|339947000
dubbed "dangerous males",|248153007
are
several times more likely|261028005|410669006|2931005|261028005|417929005|2931005
to father pregnancies|66839005|289908002
that
would
end|261782000|422117008
in
either
pre-eclampsia|15394000
or
miscarriage.|17369002

Among other things,|74964007
most
of the "dangerous males"|248153007
seemed
to
lack|41277001
sufficient levels|51117008|258395000
of the seminal immune factors necessary to|106181007
induce|16404004
immunological tolerance|37523008|228432001|37523008|77472006|37523008|71412006
in their partners.[59]|262043009

As the theory
of immune intolerance|255386009|29544009
as a cause|134198009
of pre-eclampsia|15394000
has
become
accepted, women|385645004|224526002
who
suffer
repeated pre-eclampsia,|27582007|15394000
miscarriages,|17369002
or
In Vitro Fertilization failures|55767001|76797004
could
potentially
be
administered|418283001
key immune factors|106181007
such as TGF-beta|52095000|260989008
along
with the father's foreign proteins,|66839005|88878007
possibly|60022001
either
orally,|260548002
as
a sublingual spray,|385074009
or
as a vaginal gel to|385166006
be
applied|410618006
onto the vaginal wall|263355003
before intercourse.[51]|258139002

In 2006,
researchers
at the University of Adelaide|224871002
developed
a gel containing TGF-Beta|385100002|42504009|52095000|385100002|42504009|260989008
for use|277889008|419385000
in human populations.|278412004|385436007

Later,
GroPep,
the company
which
was
awarded
the patent|56116003
on a TGF-Beta3 variant,|40885006
conducted trials|844005|110465008
where the miscarriage rate|17369002
was
halved
in the mice|447612001|447482001
studied.|110465008|224699009

According to a GroPep news
release|58000006|68776005|258760001|129299003|115956009
later
published,
"
a faulty immune response|241775008|35024006
is
implicated
in the etiology|134198009
of
as
many
as 50%
of all miscarriages."[61]|17369002
Their drug,|410942007
PV903,
was
"
targeted
to
treat|395077000
recurrent miscarriages|102878001
caused|23981006|134198009
by an abnormal immune response|263654008|35024006
to the foetus,|83418008
a condition|260905004
for which there
is
no current [drug] treatment."|15240007|410942007|276239002|15240007|410942007|416118004
[61]
Stage|21191007|371508000|261612004
I clinical trials|42146005|110465008|22971001|110465008
of their vaginal gel|385166006
were
partly successful,|385669000
succeeding
in establishing|263748003
the safety
of the drug,|410942007
but
failing
in their aim
of increasing|260369004
the number|410680006|410681005
of specific immune cells|69658003|255386009|4421005
measured|258104002
in circulation,|413854007
the necessary condition|260905004
for affecting|247591002|248448006
a desired immunological desensitization.|37523008|367428009

The trials|110465008
were
later
criticized
for failing to
recognize
the synergistic effects|253861007
of a large variety|255509001
of immune factors naturally|106181007
present|52101004|246105001
in seminal fluid,|6993007
which,
acting
together
and
with the localized presence|255471002|386397008
of the foreign paternal proteins,|224944003|88878007
modulate|261019009
the female immune response so|248152002|35024006|224526002|35024006
as to
allow
for implantation,|71861002|25602002
and
then
the subsequent immune acceptance|255260001|255386009
of the
(foreign
)
fetus|83418008
throughout a successful pregnancy.|385669000|289908002

GroPep
was
later
acquired|255396000
by the large biotechnology company Novozymes.|255509001

The development|278923009
of the PV903 drug|410942007
has
since
been
suspended.|385655000
