(
from Greek ?????? _?kzema_,|1451003
"
to boil over"|416675009|21481007
)
is
a form|246176004
of dermatitis,|182782007
[3]|260313008
or
inflammation|257552002
of the epidermis|55988001
(
the outer layer|261074009
of the skin|119325001|39937001|181469002
).[4]|260308009

The term _eczema_|281104002
is
broadly
applied|410618006
to a range
of persistent skin conditions.|95320005

These
include|55919000
dryness|13880007
and
recurring skin rashes|246455001|271807003|255227004|271807003
that
are
characterized
by one|421379005
or
more
of these symptoms
:
redness,|386713009|371240000
skin edema|95322002
(swelling|423666004|442672001
)
,
itching|424492005
and
dryness,|13880007
crusting|69640009
,
flaking|387085005
,
blistering,|408764000|247464001
cracking
,
oozing,
or
bleeding.|131148009

Areas|42798000
of temporary skin discoloration|14803004|3253007
may
appear
and
are
sometimes
due to healed injuries.|90910008

Scratching|40590001|53181008
open|56116003
a healing lesion|298005009|90910008
may
result|394617004
in scarring|275322007
and
may
enlarge|260376009|118452000
the rash.|271807003

The word _eczema_|255373000|281104002
comes
from Greek words,|1451003|255373000
that mean "|255586005
to boil|416675009
over".

Dermatitis|182782007
comes
from the Greek word|1451003|255373000
for skin ?|119325001|39937001|181469002
and
both terms
refer|439980006
to exactly
the same skin condition.|262126009|422000003

In some languages,|61909002
dermatitis|182782007
and
eczema|281104002
are
synonymous,
while
in other languages dermatitis|74964007|61909002|182782007
implies
an acute condition|272118002|260905004
and
"eczema"|281104002
a chronic one.|90734009|421379005

The two conditions|420797005|260905004
are
often|70232002
classified together.|73504009

The term eczema refers|281104002|439980006
to a set
of clinical characteristics.|58147004

Classification|73504009
of the underlying diseases|64572001
has
been
haphazard
and
unsystematic,
with many synonyms
used|394850002
to
describe
the same condition.|262126009|260905004

A type|261664005
of eczema|281104002
may
be
described
by location|246267002
(
e.g.
,
hand eczema|238539001
)
,
by specific appearance|69658003|386548000|69658003|255412001
(eczema craquele|201025002
or
discoid|255282008
)
,
or
by possible cause|371930009|134198009|60022001|134198009
(varicose eczema|366362000
).

Further adding|46053002
to the confusion,|286933003
many sources|260753009
use|277889008|419385000
the term eczema|281104002
for the most common type|4757001|72906007|261664005
of eczema|281104002
(atopic dermatitis interchangeably.|200775004

The European Academy of Allergology and Clinical Immunology (EAACI)|414152003|408480009|408480009
published
a position paper|246449006|50833004
in 2001
which
simplifies
the nomenclature
of allergy-related diseases|408439002|272151006|64572001|408439002|262094002|64572001|421961002|272151006|64572001|421961002|262094002|64572001
including|55919000
atopic|115665000
and
allergic contact eczemas.|200775004|11723008|200775004|70862002

Non-allergic eczemas|200775004
are
not
affected|247591002|248448006
by this proposal.

The classifications|73504009
below
is
ordered
by incidence frequency.|260864003|272123002

The cause|134198009
of eczema|281104002
is
unknown|261665006
but
is
presumed to
be
a combination|89780004
of genetic|3950001|255395001
and
environmental factors.[7]|102487004

The hygiene hypothesis|284779002
postulates
that
the cause|134198009
of asthma,|195967001
eczema,|281104002
and
other allergic diseases|74964007|64572001
is
an unusually
clean|228402009
environment.|276339004

It
is
supported|9096001|243114000
by epidemiologic studies|110465008|224699009
for asthma.|195967001

The hypothesis
states|398070004
that exposure|71677004|24932003
to bacteria|409822003
and
other immune system modulators|74964007|116003000
is
important
during development,|278923009
and
missing out
on this exposure increases|71677004|260366006|24932003|260366006
risk|30207005
for asthma|195967001
and
allergy.|408439002|421961002

While
it
has
been
suggested
that eczema|281104002
may
sometimes
be
an allergic reaction|421961002
to the excrement
from house dust mites,|260147004
[9]
with
up to 5%|264706000|264605009
of people|125676002
showing
antibodies|68498002
to the mites,|84073006
[10]
the overall role
this
plays|300776002
awaits
further corroboration.[11]|46053002

Researchers
have
compared
the prevalence
of eczema|281104002
in people|125676002
who also
suffer
from celiac disease|396331005
to eczema prevalence|281104002
in control subjects,|31509003
and
have
found|404684003
that eczema|281104002
occurs|272120004
about three times more frequently|421291004|410669006|70232002|421291004|417929005|70232002
in celiac disease patients|396331005|116154003
and
about
two times|420797005|410669006|420797005|417929005
more frequently|242762006|70232002
in relatives|125677006
of celiac patients,|116154003
potentially
indicating|410535002
a genetic link|3950001|255395001
between the two conditions.[12]|420797005|260905004

Diagnosis|439401001
of eczema|281104002
is
based mostly|418836005
on history|392521001
and
physical examination.|5880005

However,
in uncertain cases,|64957009|398241000|64957009|413769002
skin biopsy|240977001
may
be
useful.

Those with eczema|20401003|281104002|421463005|281104002
should
not
get
the smallpox vaccination|40001004
due to risk|30207005
of developing eczema vaccinatum,|238368001
a potentially severe|24484000
and
sometimes fatal complication.[13]|399166001|116223007|399166001|263718001

There
is
no known cure|36692007
for eczema|281104002
;
therefore,
treatments|276239002
aim
to
control|31509003
the symptoms
by reducing inflammation|260400001|257552002
and
relieving itching.|1241001|424492005|397855004|424492005|398004007|424492005

Corticosteroids|79440004
are
highly effective|75540009|255403003|75540009|254648000
in controlling|54776003|31509003
or
suppressing symptoms|245780008
in most cases.|398241000|413769002

For mild-moderate eczema|371923003|281104002
a weak steroid|13791008|116566001|260407003|116566001
may
be
used|394850002
(e.g.|258795003

hydrocortisone,|396458002
while
in more severe cases|242762006|24484000|398241000|242762006|24484000|413769002
a higher-potency steroid|75540009|30207005|116566001|371879000|30207005|116566001
(e.g.|258795003

clobetasol propionate|32197004
may
be
used.|394850002

In severe cases,|24484000|398241000|24484000|413769002
oral|260548002
or
injectable corticosteroids|385218009|79440004|129326001|79440004
may
be
used.|394850002

While
these usually
bring|68369002
about rapid improvements,|255358001
they
have
greater side effects.|263768009

Prolonged use|255224006|277889008|255224006|419385000
of topical corticosteroids|331645009
is
thought to|88952004
increase|260366006
the risk|30207005
of side effects,
the most common|4757001|72906007
of which
is
the skin|119325001|39937001|181469002
becoming
thin|18043004
and
fragile|59955000
(atrophy.|13331008

Because of this,
if
used|394850002
on the face|89545001|302549007
or
other|74964007
delicate
skin,|119325001|39937001|181469002
only
a low-strength steroid|62482003|260404005|116566001|371880002|260404005|116566001
should
be
used.|394850002

Additionally,
high-strength steroids|75540009|260404005|116566001|371879000|260404005|116566001
used|394850002
over large areas,|255509001|42798000
or
under occlusion,|25272006|26036001|257885003|263823007
may
be
significantly
absorbed
into the body,|279495008|123037004
causing|23981006
hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis suppression|442320004|80633008|442320004|258761002
(HPA axis suppression|28585007|39976000|80633008|28585007|39976000|258761002|28585007|388282002|80633008|28585007|388282002|258761002
).

Finally
by their immunosuppressive action|372823004|129264002
they
can
,
if
used|394850002
without antibiotics|255631004
or
antifungal drugs,|373219008
lead|88488004
to some skin infections|108365000
(fungal|414561005
or
bacterial.|409822003

Care
must
be
taken|419652001
to
avoid
the eyes,|81745001
as
topical corticosteroids|331645009
applied|410618006
to the eye|81745001|244486005
can
cause|23981006|134198009
glaucoma [17]|23986001
or
cataracts.|247053007|95722004

Because of the risks|30207005
associated|47429007
with this type|261664005
of drug,|410942007
a steroid|116566001
of an appropriate strength|260404005
should
be
sparingly|420883007
applied|410618006
only to|50607009|420295001
control|31509003
an episode|272128006
of eczema.|281104002

Once the desired response
has
been
achieved
,
it
should
be
discontinued|410546004
and
replaced|282089006|370124000
with emollients|373380003
as maintenance therapy.|314122007

Corticosteroids|79440004
are
generally
considered
safe to
use|277889008|419385000
in the short-|359530003|367450005
to medium-term|255508009
for controlling eczema,|54776003|281104002|31509003|281104002
with no significant side effects|386134007
differing
from treatment|276239002|416118004
with non-steroidal ointment.[18]|116566001|385101003

Some recent research|6493001
claims
that topically applied corticosteroids|410618006|79440004
did
not significantly
increase|260366006
the risk|30207005
of skin thinning,|277797007
stretch marks|201066002|271674009
or
HPA axis suppression|28585007|39976000|80633008|28585007|39976000|258761002|28585007|388282002|80633008|28585007|388282002|258761002
(
and
where such suppression|80633008|258761002
did
occur|272120004
,
it
was
mild|255604002
and
reversible|35174006
where the corticosteroids|79440004
were
used|394850002
for limited periods|57615005
of time|410669006
).

Further,|46053002
skin conditions|95320005
are
often|70232002
under-treated|261089000|28995006
because of fears
of side effects.

This
has
led|88488004|236874000
some researchers to
suggest
that
the usual dosage instructions|277406006|409073007
should
be
changed|243326001|263703002
from "
Use|277889008|419385000
sparingly"|420883007
to "
Apply|410618006|417924000
enough to
cover|255334000
affected areas",|247591002|42798000|248448006|42798000
and
that specific dosage directions|69658003|277406006|255512003
using|260676000
"fingertip units"|312543003|258666001
or
FTUs
be
provided
,
along
with photos to
illustrate
FTUs.

However,
caution
must
always
be
used|394850002
as long-term use,|277889008|419385000
prolonged|255224006
widespread coverage,|85333001
or
use|277889008|419385000
with occlusion,|25272006|26036001|257885003|263823007
can
create
side effects
that
are
permanent|6934004
and
resistant|30714006
to treatment.[20]|276239002|416118004

Topical immunosuppressants|372823004|359540000|372823004
like pimecrolimus|385580005
(Elidel
and
Douglan
)
and
tacrolimus|386975001|105331000
(Protopic
)
were
developed
after topical corticosteroids|331645009
had
come
into widespread use.|85333001|277889008|85333001|419385000

These newer agents effectively|7147002|260872001
suppress|245780008
the immune system|116003000
in the affected area,|247591002|42798000|248448006|42798000
and
appear
to
yield
better results|3442003|394617004
in some populations.|385436007

The U.S.|223688001

Food and Drug Administration|255620007|18629005
has
issued|55607006
a public health advisory|310115006
about the possible risk|371930009|30207005|60022001|30207005
of lymph node|59441001|181756000
or
skin cancer|372130007
from use|277889008|419385000
of these products,
[21]
but
many professional medical organizations|74188005|21139007
disagree
with the FDA's findings|404684003
;

When
eczema|281104002
is
severe|24484000
and
does
not
respond
to other forms|74964007|246176004
of treatment,|276239002|416118004
immunosuppressant drugs|372823004|410942007
are
sometimes
prescribed.

These dampen
the immune system|116003000
and
can
result|394617004
in dramatic improvements
to the patient's eczema.|116154003|281104002

However,
immunosuppressants|372823004
can
cause|23981006|134198009
side effects
on the body.|279495008|123037004

As
such,
patients|116154003
must
undergo
regular blood tests|17854005|252275004
and
be
closely
monitored|302805002|13288007
by a doctor.|309343006

In the UK,
the most commonly used immunosuppressants|4757001|394850002|372823004
for eczema|281104002
are
ciclosporin,|387467008
azathioprine|372574004
and
methotrexate.|387381009

These drugs|410942007
were
generally
designed
for other medical conditions|74964007|74188005|260905004
but
have
been
found|404684003
to
be
effective|255403003|254648000
against eczema.|281104002

Anti-itch drugs,|424492005|410942007
often antihistamine,|70232002|372806008
and
dermasil

reduce|260400001
the itch|424492005

_] However,
in some cases,|398241000|413769002
significant benefit|386134007
may
be
due to the sedative side effects|372614000
of these drugs,|410942007
rather than
their specific antihistamine effect.|69658003|372806008|253861007

Thus sedating antihistamines|372625009
such as promethazine|372871004
(Phenergan|14905007
)
or
diphenhydramine|372682005
(Benadryl|19510001

antihistamines.[26]|372806008

Capsaicin|95995002

be
found|404684003
by cooling
the skin|119325001|39937001|181469002
via water|11713004|119318008
(swimming,|20461001

Eczema|281104002
can
be
exacerbated|162473008|410661009
by dryness|13880007
of the skin.|119325001|39937001|181469002

Moisturizing
is
one|421379005
of the most important self-care treatments|4757001|384758001|276239002
for eczema.|281104002

Keeping
the affected area moistened|247591002|42798000|248448006|42798000
can
promote
skin healing|119325001|298005009|119325001|90910008|39937001|298005009|39937001|90910008|181469002|298005009|181469002|90910008
and
relief|224978009
of symptoms.

Soaps|25780000
and
detergents|264299001
should
not
be
used|394850002
on affected skin|247591002|119325001|247591002|39937001|247591002|181469002|248448006|119325001|248448006|39937001|248448006|181469002
because
they
can
strip|408097009
natural skin oils|510009|420540006
and
lead|88488004
to excessive dryness.|260378005|13880007

Moistening agents|260872001
are
called
emollients.|373380003

In general,|60132005
it
is
best to|20572008|3442003
match|33336008
thicker ointments|246703001|385101003
to the driest, flakiest skin.|16386004|387085005|16386004

Light emollients|56242006|373380003|371268001|373380003
may
not
have
any effect|253861007
on severely dry skin.|24484000|16386004

Moisturizing gloves|52291003
(gloves|52291003
which
keep
emollients|373380003
in contact|52101004|11723008|52101004|70862002|18720000|11723008|18720000|70862002
with skin|119325001|39937001|181469002
on the hands|85562004
)
can
be
worn
while
sleeping.|258158006|248220008

Generally,
twice-daily applications|229799001|410618006
of emollients|373380003
work|261041009
best.

Ointments,|385101003
with less water content,|276139006|11713004|276824008|276139006|119318008|276824008|263796003|11713004|276824008|263796003|119318008|276824008
stay
on the skin longer|119325001|255511005|39937001|255511005|181469002|255511005
and
need|410525008|103325001
fewer applications,|57176003|410618006
but
they
can
be
greasy|13524005
and
inconvenient.

Steroids|116566001
may
also
be
mixed|26242008
in
with ointments.|385101003

For unbroken skin,|119325001|39937001|181469002
direct application|255589003|410618006
of waterproof tape
with
or
without an emollient|373380003
or
prescription ointment|260885003|385101003
can
improve|385425000|3442003|385633008
moisture levels|17461003|258395000
and
skin integrity|364535009
which
allows
the skin|119325001|39937001|181469002
to heal.|298005009

This treatment regimen|276239002|416118004
can
also
help
prevent
the skin|119325001|39937001|181469002
from cracking,
as well as
put
a stop|422117008
to the itch cycle.|424492005|44180009

The end result|261782000|394617004|422117008|394617004
is
reduced lichenification|260400001|402237006
(
the roughening
of skin|119325001|39937001|181469002
from repeated scratching|27582007|40590001|27582007|53181008
).

Taping works|118481004|261041009
best
on skin away|119325001|39937001|181469002
from joints.|39352004|81087007

There
is
a disagreement
whether baths
are
desirable
or
a necessary evil.

For example,
the Mayo Clinic advises|223807006|35971002|424900004|223807006|257585005|424900004
against daily baths to|69620002
avoid
skin drying.

On the other hand,|74964007|85562004|74964007|302539009
the American Academy of Dermatology|394582007
claims
"
it
is
a common misconception|72906007
that bathing dries|129002005|257791009|129002005|13880007|60369001|257791009|60369001|13880007

and
should
be
kept
to a bare minimum"|255605001|255604002
and
recommends
bathing to|129002005|60369001
hydrate
skin.|119325001|39937001|181469002

They even
suggest
up to 3 short baths|260313008|359530003|260313008|367450005
a day|258703001|259032004
for people|125676002
with severe eczema.|24484000|281104002

According to them,
a moisturizer
should
be
applied|410618006
within 3 minutes to|260313008|258701004|260313008|255507004|260313008|356624006
trap|403833009
the moisture|17461003
from bath
in the skin.[28]|119325001|39937001|181469002

Anecdotal evidence|18669006
suggested
that soft water|37378003|11713004|37378003|119318008
could
have
therapeutic effects|262202000|253861007
for people|125676002
with eczema currently|281104002|15240007
using|260676000
hard water.|72505002|11713004|72505002|119318008

However,
a trial|110465008
involving|248448006
336 children|410601007|160499008
with eczema|281104002
showed
no objective difference|410518001|263735002|260224007|263735002
in outcomes|394617004
between the children|410601007|160499008
whose homes|261770009
were
fitted|91175000|102499006
with a water softener|11713004|119318008
and
those
without.[30]

Recently_[|6493001
when?_],
ceramides,|37112001
which
are
the major lipid constituent|255603008|70106000|312297002
of the stratum corneum,|20281003
have
been
used|394850002
in the treatment|276239002|416118004
of eczema.|281104002

They
are
often|70232002
one|421379005
of the ingredients
of modern moisturizers.

These lipids|70106000
were
also successfully
produced
synthetically
in the laboratory.[34]|261904005

However,
detergents|264299001
are
so ubiquitous|223528007
in modern environments|276339004
in items
like tissues,|85756007
and
so persistent|223528007
on surfaces,|410678000
"safe" soaps|25780000
are
necessary to
remove|127485006
them
from the skin|119325001|39937001|181469002
in order to
control|31509003
eczema.|281104002

Although
most eczema recommendations|281104002
use|277889008|419385000
the terms "detergents"|264299001
and
"
soaps|25780000
" interchangeably,
and
tell eczema|281104002
sufferers
to
avoid
both
,
detergents|264299001
and
soaps|25780000
are
not
the same|262126009
and
are
not equally problematic
to eczema sufferers.|281104002

Detergents,|264299001
which
differ
from soap|25780000
in
that
they commonly
have
a sulfate polar group,|95975008|261586004|95975008|160481000|95975008|389109008
increase|260366006
the permeability|82540007
of skin membranes|119325001|83097008|39937001|83097008|181469002|83097008
in a way
that soaps|25780000
and
water|11713004|119318008
alone|105529008
do
not.

Sodium lauryl sulfate,|412310002
the most common household detergent,|4757001|72906007|264299001
has
been
shown
to
amplify
the allergenicity|90260006
of other substances|74964007|105590001
("increase antigen penetration"|260366006|7120007|53568006
).[35]

Unfortunately there
is
no one
agreed
-
upon best kind|261664005
of skin cleanser|119325001|39937001|181469002
for eczema sufferers.|281104002

Different clinical tests,|263735002|58147004|269814003|263735002|58147004|272393004
sponsored
by different personal product companies,|263735002
unsurprisingly tout various brands|256220008
as the most skin-friendly|4757001|119325001|4757001|39937001|4757001|181469002
based|418836005
on specific properties|69658003|370130000|69658003|116685008
of various products|256220008
and
different underlying assumptions|263735002
as to what really
determines
skin friendliness.|119325001|39937001|181469002

The terms "hypoallergenic"
and
"doctor|309343006
tested"|272393004
are
not
regulated
,
[36]
and
no research
has
been
done
showing
that products
labeled
"hypoallergenic"
are
in fact
less problematic|276139006|263796003
than any others.|74964007

It
may
be
best to
avoid
soaps|25780000
and
detergent cleansers altogether,|264299001
except for the armpits,|422543003
groin|255575008
and
perianal areas,|264133008|42798000
and
use cheap bland emollients|277889008|373380003|419385000|373380003
in the bath
or
shower.

Various measures|256220008|246445000|256220008|367346004
may
reduce|260400001
the amount|107651007
of mite antigens,|84073006|7120007
in particular swapping carpets
for hard surfaces.|72505002|410678000

However
it
is
not
clear|263707001
whether
such
measures|246445000|367346004
actually
help
with eczema.|281104002

A controlled study|31509003|110465008|31509003|224699009
suggested
that
a number|410680006|410681005
of environmental factors|102487004
such as air exchange rates,|417696007
relative humidity|250829009
and
room temperature|105723007|246508008
(
but
not
the level|258395000|276625007
of house dust mites|260147004
)
might
have
an effect|253861007
on the condition.[38]|260905004|264670000

Light therapy|31394004
(
or
deep penetrating light therapy|131197000|53568006|31394004
using|260676000
ultraviolet light|41355003
can
help
control eczema.|31509003|281104002

UVA
is
mostly
used|394850002
,
but
UVB
and
Narrow Band UVB|18043004|77541009|18043004|255281001|25659002|77541009|25659002|255281001|134223000|77541009|134223000|255281001
are
also
used.|394850002

Overexposure
to ultraviolet light|41355003
carries|288345009
its own risks,|30207005
particularly potential skin cancer|30207005|372130007
from exposure.[40]|71677004|259031006|24932003|259031006

When
light therapy|31394004
alone|105529008
is
found to|404684003
be
ineffective,
the treatment|276239002|416118004
is
performed|398166005
with the application|410618006
(
or
ingestion|111984006
)
of a substance|105590001
called
psoralen.|419047007

This PUVA
(Psoralen + UVA|419047007
)
combination therapy|229554006
is
termed photo-chemotherapy.|416608005|367336001

Psoralens|419047007
make
the skin|119325001|39937001|181469002
more sensitive|242762006|83185005
to UV light,|41355003
thus allowing lower doses|261122009|277406006
of UVA to
be
used.|394850002

However,
the increased sensitivity|35105006|35209006|35105006|365705006|260366006|35209006|260366006|365705006
to UV light also|41355003
puts
the patient|116154003
at greater risk|263768009|30207005
for skin cancer.[41]|372130007

Recent studies|6493001|110465008|6493001|224699009
provide
hints
that food allergy|414285001
may
trigger|410658008
atopic dermatitis.|200775004

For these people,|125676002
identifying|7882003
the allergens|90260006
could
lead|88488004
to an avoidance diet to|41829006
help
minimize
symptoms,
although
this approach
is
still
in an experimental stage.|21191007|371508000|261612004

that
have
been
reported|229059009|223458004

_] However,
in 2009,
researchers
at National Jewish|276121002|160543007
Medical|74188005
and
Research Center|26216008
found|404684003
that eczema patients|281104002|116154003
were
especially prone|1240000
to misdiagnosis
of food allergies.[43][44]|414285001

A study|110465008|224699009
led|88488004|236874000
by researchers
at the University of California,|224871002|224043007|224871002|25997004
San Diego School|257698009
of Medicine|410942007
suggests
that use|277889008|419385000
of oral vitamin D3|260548002|108943009|260548002|105029001
supplements|373453009
bolsters
production
of a protective chemical normally|441900009
found|404684003
in the skin,|119325001|39937001|181469002
and
may
help
prevent
skin infections|108365000
that
are
a common result|72906007|394617004
of atopic dermatitis,|200775004
the most common form|4757001|72906007|246176004
of eczema.|281104002

It
can
be
noted
that
the production
of vitamin D3|108943009|105029001
is
catalyzed
by UV radiation|41355003
and
may
influence
histocompatibility expression,|10012005
correlating
with both
the seasonality|21864008
of eczema|281104002
and
its relation|125677006
to the immune system.|116003000

A number|410680006|410681005
of alternative therapies|276239002
are
used|394850002
for eczema|281104002
including|55919000
:

Patients|116154003
can
also
wear
clothing|272180002
designed
specifically to
manage|119270007
the itching,|424492005
scratching|40590001|53181008
and
peeling|257890000|51979000
associated|47429007
with eczema.[54]|281104002

In the 1980s,
Swedish dermatologist Peter Noren|18803008
developed
a behavioural approach|844005
to the treatment|276239002|416118004
of long term atopic eczema.|200775004

This approach
has
been
further|46053002
developed
by dermatologist Richard Staughton|18803008
and
psychiatrist Christopher Bridgett|80584001
at the Chelsea
and
Westminster Hospital|285201006
in London.

Patients|116154003
undergo
a six-week|422218008|258705008|422218008|259038000
monitored|302805002|13288007
program
involving|248448006
scratch habit reversal|53181008|90275003
and
self-awareness|225510008
of scratching levels.|40590001|258395000|53181008|258395000

For long-term eczema sufferers,|281104002
scratching|40590001|53181008
can
become
habitual.|40451002

Sometimes
scratching|40590001|53181008
becomes
a reflex,|87572000|106146005
resulting|42752001
in scratching|40590001|53181008
without conscious awareness,|312012004
rather than
from the feeling|285854004
of itchiness
itself.

The habit reversal program|90275003
is
done
in conjunction with the standard applied emollient/corticosteroid treatments|410618006|373380003|79440004|276239002
so
that
the skin|119325001|39937001|181469002
can
heal.|298005009

It also
reduces|260400001
future scratching,|40590001|53181008
as well as
reduces|260400001
the likelihood|2931005
of further flareups.|46053002

The behavioural approach|844005
can
give|419582001
an eczema|281104002
sufferer
some control|31509003
over the degree|258395000|246173007
of severity|272141005
of eczema.|281104002

The lifetime clinician-recorded prevalence
of eczema|281104002
has
been
seen
to peak|255587001
in infancy,|3658006
with female predominance|248152002|224526002
of eczema presentations|281104002|246105001
occurring|272120004
during the reproductive period|259037005
of 15?49 years.|258707000

Although
little data
on the trend|30294006
of eczema prevalence|281104002
over time|410669006
exists
prior to the Second World War|81170007|257997001|288495006
(1939?45
)
,
the prevalence
of eczema|281104002
has
been
found|404684003
to
have
increased|35105006|260366006
substantially
in the latter half
of the 20th Century,
with eczema in school-aged children|281104002|160498000|424144002|281104002|160498000|105436006
being
found to|404684003
increase|260366006
between the late 1940s|260383002
and
2000.

A review
of epidemiological data
in the UK
has
also
found|404684003
an inexorable rise
in the prevalence
of eczema|281104002
over time.|410669006

Further recent increases|46053002|6493001|260366006
in the incidence
and
lifetime prevalence
of eczema|281104002
in England|223664003
have
also
been
reported|229059009|223458004
,
such
that
an estimated 5,773,700|414135002
or
about
one|421379005
in every nine people|422113007|125676002
have
been
diagnosed|439401001
with the disease|64572001
by a clinician
at some point
in their lives.[60]|224130005

Other than direct treatments|255589003|276239002
of the symptoms,
no cure
is
presently
known|36692007
for most types|261664005
of dermatitis|182782007
;
even cortisone treatments|32498003|276239002
and
immunomodulation
may
often|70232002
have
only minor effects|50607009|410599005|253861007|50607009|255606000|253861007|420295001|410599005|253861007|420295001|255606000|253861007
on what
may
be
a complex problem.|103360007|55607006

Even
though
the effects|253861007
of eczema|281104002
are
no longer active|255511005|55561003
the person|125676002
diagnosed|439401001
is
still
subject to
relapse.|263855007|255318003|58184002

As the condition|260905004
is
often|70232002
related|272151006|262094002
to family history|57177007
of allergies|421961002
(
and
thus heredity
)
,
it
is
probable|2931005
that gene therapy|394613000
or
genetic engineering|3950001|106269003|255395001|106269003
might
help.

Damage|37782003
from the enzymatic activity|90668006|48761009|90668006|55561003|90668006|258745004|90668006|257733005
of allergens|90260006
is
usually
prevented|116699007
by the body's own protease inhibitors,|279495008|422745008|123037004|422745008
such as,
LEKTI,
produced
from the gene SPINK5.|67271001

Mutations|55446002
in this gene|67271001
are
known|36692007
to
cause|23981006|134198009
Netherton's syndrome,|312514006
which
is
a congenital erythroderma.|6160004|200948000|255399007|200948000

These patients nearly always|116154003
develop
atopic disease,|115665000
including|55919000
hay fever,|444316004
food allergy,|414285001
urticaria|126485001
and
asthma.|195967001

Such evidence|18669006
supports|9096001|243114000
the hypothesis
that skin damage|119325001|37782003|39937001|37782003|181469002|37782003
from allergens|90260006
may
be
the cause|134198009
of eczema,|281104002
and
may
provide
a venue
for further treatment.[61]|46053002|276239002|46053002|416118004

Another study|110465008|224699009
identified|7882003
a gene|67271001
that
the researchers
believe
to
be
the cause|134198009
of inherited eczema|255404009|281104002
and
some related disorders.|272151006|64572001|262094002|64572001

The gene|67271001
produces
the protein filaggrin,|88878007
the lack|41277001
of which
causes|134198009
dry skin|16386004
and
impaired skin barrier function.[62]|260379002|64501009|40226000|64501009

A recent study|6493001|110465008|6493001|224699009
indicated|410535002
that two specific chemicals|420797005|69658003|441900009
found|404684003
in the blood|87612001|119273009
are
connected
to the itching sensations|424492005|106148006|424492005|272144002
associated|47429007
with eczema.|281104002

The chemicals|441900009
are
Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF)|12738006|12915002|258335003|12915002
and
Substance P.[63]|585007

In a genome-wide study|18470003|90522003|110465008|18470003|90522003|224699009
published
on Dec 25,
2011
in Nature Genetics,|277302009
researchers
reported|229059009|223458004
discovery
of three new genetic variants|421291004|7147002|3950001|40885006|421291004|7147002|255395001|40885006
associated|47429007
with eczema.|281104002

They
are
OVOL1,
ACTL9
and
IL4-KIF3A.[64]|48727007

Eczema|281104002
has
increased|35105006|260366006
dramatically
in England|223664003
as
a study|110465008|224699009
showed
a 42% rise
in diagnosis|439401001
of the condition|260905004
between 2001
and
2005,
by which time|410669006
it
was
estimated|414135002
to
affect|4065008
5.7 million adults|264706000|133936004|264605009|133936004
and
children.|410601007|160499008

A paper|50833004
in the Journal
of the Royal Society of Medicine says Eczema|410942007|66049007|281104002
is
thought to|88952004
be
a trigger|410658008
for other allergic conditions.|74964007|260905004

GP records
show
over 9 million patients|116154003
were
used|394850002
by researchers to
assess
how
many people|125676002
have
the skin disorder.[65]|95320005|264695004
