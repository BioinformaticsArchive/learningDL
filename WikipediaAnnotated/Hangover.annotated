is
the experience
of various unpleasant physiological effects|256220008|1360005|253861007
following|255260001
heavy consumption|410712002
of alcoholic beverages.|53527002

The most commonly reported characteristics|4757001|229059009|4757001|223458004
of a hangover|32553006
include|55919000
headache,|25064002
nausea,|422587007
sensitivity|35209006|365705006
to light|56242006|371268001
and
noise,
lethargy,|214264003
dysphoria,|30819006
diarrhea|398032003
and
thirst,|59299002
typically
after the intoxicating effect|253861007
of the alcohol|419442005|53041004|430837008
begins|255395001
to
wear
off.

While
a hangover|32553006
can
be
experienced
at any time,|410669006
generally
a hangover|32553006
is
experienced
the morning|73775008
after a night|2546009
of heavy drinking.|410712002|160573003|410712002|30953006

In addition|260364009
to the physical symptoms,|5880005|19388002
a hangover|32553006
may
also
induce|16404004
psychological symptoms|25618008
including|55919000
heightened feelings|260365005|285854004|260365005|260366006|285854004|260366006
of depression|35489007|366979004|255339005
and
anxiety.|48694002|197480006

Hypoglycemia,|271327008
dehydration,|34095006
acetaldehyde intoxication,|38705000
and
glutamine rebound|412421007
are
all theorized causes|134198009
of hangover symptoms.|32553006

Hangover symptoms|32553006
may
persist
for several days|261028005|258703001
after alcohol|419442005|53041004|430837008
was
last
consumed.

Approximately 25-30%|26175008
of drinkers
may
be
resistant to|30714006
hangover|32553006
symptoms.

Some aspects
of a hangover|32553006
are
viewed|246516004
as symptoms
of acute ethanol withdrawal,|272118002|419442005
similar
to the longer-duration effects|260384008|253861007
of withdrawal
from alcoholism,|7200002
as
determined
by studying|110465008|224699009
the increases|260366006
in brain reward thresholds|12738006|118589004|258335003|118589004

ethanol injection.|419442005|28289002|419442005|385218009|419442005|129326001

Dehydration|34095006
is
caused|23981006|134198009
by alcohol's ability to|419442005|371150009|53041004|371150009|430837008|371150009
inhibit|61511001

of anti-diuretic hormone|372695000|87568004
on kidney tubules,|58471003
[4]|260308009
which
leads|88488004|236874000
to an interruption|76555007
of the body's Krebs cycle_[citation|279495008|129911007|123037004|129911007

An alcohol hangover|32553006
is
associated|47429007
with a variety
of symptoms
that
may
include|55919000
dehydration,|34095006
fatigue,|84229001
headache,|25064002
body aches,|279495008|410711009|123037004|410711009
vomiting|249497008

diarrhea,|398032003
flatulence,|308698004

irritability,|55929007
sensitivity|35209006|365705006
to light|56242006|371268001
and
noise,
erratic motor functions|52479005
(
including|55919000
tremor,|26079004
trouble sleeping,|258158006|248220008
severe hunger,|24484000|55350005
halitosis,|79879001
and
lack|41277001
of depth perception.|251763006

Many people|260396001|125676002
will
also
be
repulsed
by the thought, taste|88952004|76489005
or
smell|397686008
of alcohol|419442005|53041004|430837008
during a hangover.|32553006

The symptoms
vary
significantly
from person|125676002
to person,|125676002
and
it
is
not
clear|263707001
whether hangovers directly|32553006
affect|4065008
cognitive abilities.|413384008

Ethanol|419442005
has
a dehydrating effect|34095006|253861007
by causing increased urine production|23981006|35105006|78014005|23981006|260366006|78014005
(diuresis,|162182005
which
causes|134198009
headaches,|25064002
dry mouth,|56893005
and
lethargy.|214264003

Dehydration also|34095006
causes|134198009
fluids|32457005|33463005
in the brain to|12738006|258335003
be
less plentiful.|276139006|263796003

This
can
be
mitigated|6736007
by drinking water before,|160573003|11713004|160573003|119318008|30953006|11713004|30953006|119318008
during
and
after consumption
of alcohol.|419442005|53041004|430837008

Alcohol's effect|419442005|253861007|53041004|253861007|430837008|253861007
on the stomach lining|69695003|50009006|181246003|50009006
can
account
for nausea._[citation|422587007
needed|410525008|103325001
_]

Another contributing factor
is
the presence|386397008
of products
from the breakdown|40091007|125366008
of ethanol|419442005
by liver enzymes.|259670004|365769003

Ethanol|419442005
is
converted
to acetaldehyde|38705000
by the enzyme alcohol dehydrogenase,|90668006|87336008
and
then
from acetaldehyde|38705000
to acetic acid|422082008
by the enzyme acetaldehyde dehydrogenase.|90668006|75272008

Acetaldehyde|38705000
(ethanal|38705000
)
is
between 10
and
30 times|410669006|417929005
more toxic|242762006
than alcohol|419442005|53041004|430837008
itself.[5]|264706000|264605009

These two reactions also|420797005|263851003
require
the conversion|272148004
of NAD+|131143000
to NADH.

With an excess|260378005
of NADH,
three enzymes|421291004|90668006
of the Citric Acid Cycle|129911007
are
inhibited|61511001
(citrate synthase,|87222001
isocitrate dehydrogenase,|259318006
and
alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase essentially|73031001|129925008
shutting
it
down.

Pyruvate|430640006
(
the end product|261782000|422117008
of glycolysis
)
starts|255395001|385652002
to
accumulate
,
and
the excess NADH|260378005
drives|247750002
lactate dehydrogenase to|259319003
produce
lactate|83036002
from pyruvate|430640006
in order to
regenerate
NAD+|131143000
and
sustain|263892007
life.|224130005

This diverts pyruvate|430640006
from other pathways|74964007
such as gluconeogenesis,
thereby
impairing|260379002
the ability|371150009
of the liver to|10200004|181268008
compensate|17275008
for a drop|404218003
in blood glucose levels,|365812005
especially
for the brain.|12738006|258335003

Because
glucose|67079006|72191006
is
the primary energy source|63161005|260754003|261424001|260754003
of the brain,|12738006|258335003
this lack|41277001
of glucose|67079006|72191006
(hypoglycemia|271327008
contributes
to symptoms
such as fatigue,|84229001
weakness,|13791008|260407003
mood disturbances,|48079002
and
decreased attention|1250004|6769007|260400001|6769007|260371004|6769007
and
concentration._[citation|82742001
needed|410525008|103325001
_]

Alcohol consumption|160573003
can
result|394617004
in depletion|69251000
of the liver's supply|10200004|425398004|181268008|425398004
of glutathione[6]|423272009|63399009
and
other reductive detoxification agents,|74964007|67516001|260872001
[7]
reducing|260400001
its ability|371150009
to effectively
remove|127485006
acetaldehyde|38705000
and
other toxins|74964007|80917008
from the bloodstream.

Additionally,
alcohol|419442005|53041004|430837008
induces|16404004
the CYP2E1 enzyme,|422428002|90668006
which
itself
can
produce
additional toxins|260364009|80917008
and
free radicals.[8]|39265005

In addition,|260364009
it
is
thought|88952004
that
the presence|386397008
of other alcohols|74964007|53041004
(fusel oils|73421003
and
other by-products|74964007
of alcoholic fermentation|228281002|40336005
(also called congeners,
exaggerate|260377000
many
of the symptoms
;
this probably
accounts
for the mitigation
of the effects|253861007
when
distilled alcohol,|419442005|53041004|430837008
particularly vodka,|226064009
is
consumed instead.

A 2009
study|110465008|224699009
provided evidence|18669006
that darker-coloured liquors,|255419005|103366001|77012006|255419005|103366001|6524003
such as bourbon,|226018004
cause|23981006|134198009
worse hangovers|230993007|230993007|32553006|390772001|390772001|32553006|231877006|231877006|32553006
than lighter-coloured liquors,|75926004|103366001|77012006|75926004|103366001|6524003
such as vodka.|226064009

The higher amount|75540009|107651007|371879000|107651007
of congeners
found|404684003
in darker liquors|255419005|77012006|255419005|6524003
compared
to
lighter|75926004
ones|421379005
was
indicated|410535002
as the cause.|134198009

Studies|110465008|224699009
that
attempt
to
compare
hangover|32553006
producing
potential|30207005
and
hangover severity|272141005|32553006|272141005
of different alcoholic drinks|263735002|53527002
suggest
the following ordering|255260001
(starting|255395001|385652002
with the least hangover-|276139006|276139006|32553006|263796003|263796003|32553006

In a 2006 study,|110465008|224699009
an average
of 14 standard drinks|226465004
(330 ml bottles|259035002|68276009|259035002|419672006
)
of beer|53410008
was
needed|410525008|103325001
to
produce
a hangover,|32553006
compared
with only 7|50607009|420295001
to 8 drinks|226465004
of wine|35748005
or
liquor.|77012006|6524003

One potent congener|421379005|30207005
is
methanol.|259221006

It
is
naturally
formed|35810008
in small quantities|255507004|107651007
during fermentation|40336005
and
it
can
be
accidentally
concentrated
by improper distillation techniques.|272394005

Metabolism|47722004
of methanol|259221006
produces
an extremely toxic compound,|62105006
formaldehyde|111095003
;
however,
its metabolism|47722004
is
suppressed|245780008
when
ethanol|419442005
is
present|52101004|246105001
in the bloodstream.

This
is
thought to|88952004
provide
a mechanism|257544000
for hangover|32553006
that starts|255395001
when
blood alcohol content|87612001|419442005|276824008|87612001|53041004|276824008|87612001|430837008|276824008|119273009|419442005|276824008|119273009|53041004|276824008|119273009|430837008|276824008
approaches|103379005
zero|258317007
and
can
be
"
cured
"
by alcohol.|419442005|53041004|430837008

Most people|125676002
of East Asian descent|414978006
have
a mutation|55446002
in their alcohol dehydrogenase gene|87336008|67271001
that
makes
this enzyme|90668006
unusually effective|255403003|254648000
at converting ethanol|419442005
to acetaldehyde,|38705000
and
about half
of such people also|125676002
have
a form|246176004
of acetaldehyde dehydrogenase|75272008
that
is
less effective|276139006|255403003|276139006|254648000|263796003|255403003|263796003|254648000
at converting acetaldehyde|38705000
to acetic acid.|422082008

This combination|89780004
causes|134198009
them to
suffer
from alcohol flush reaction,|419442005|271811009|263851003|53041004|271811009|263851003|430837008|271811009|263851003
in which acetaldehyde|38705000
accumulates
after drinking,|160573003|30953006
leading|236874000
to immediate|88694003|49499008
and
severe hangover symptoms.|162470006|162470006|32553006

These people|125676002
are
therefore less likely to|2931005
become
alcoholics.[14][15]|228281002

It
is
often|70232002
said|66049007
that hangovers|32553006
grow
worse|230993007|390772001|231877006
as one ages|421379005|424144002
;
this
is
thought to|88952004
be
caused|23981006|134198009
by declining supplies|425398004
of alcohol dehydrogenase,|87336008
the enzyme|90668006
involved|248448006
in metabolizing alcohol.[16]|419442005|53041004|430837008

However,
in a model
of migraine,|37796009
it
was
demonstrated
that acetate|429850007
is
the primary metabolite|63161005|261424001
of alcohol|419442005|53041004|430837008
responsible|394851003
for alcohol|419442005|53041004|430837008
induced|16404004
periorbital hypersensitivity.|263952009|421961002|263952009|421369008

Furthermore,
in the same model|262126009
they
recapitulated
the effectiveness|255403003
of caffeine,|255641001
ketorolac|372501008
for ameliorating
this hypersensitivity.|421961002|421369008

The Alcohol Hangover Research Group|32553006|261586004|32553006|160481000|32553006|389109008
had
its inaugual meeting|229057006
in June 2010
as part|260726005
of the Research Society on Alcoholism (RSA) 33rd Annual Scientific Meeting|18720000|7200002|53281000|229057006
in San Antonio,
Texas.|421662006

In 2010,
researchers
from the Centre|26216008
for Alcohol|419442005|53041004|430837008
and
Drug Research|410942007
at the University of Aarhus|224871002
in Copenhagen
charted
how hangovers|32553006
progress|385651009
over time|410669006
in the face|89545001|302549007
of continued drinking.|255238004|160573003|255238004|30953006

They
found|404684003
no evidence|18669006
of hangover tolerance.|228432001|77472006|71412006|32553006|228432001|32553006|77472006|32553006|71412006

Instead,
they
found|404684003
that hangover symptoms|32553006
became
steadily worse|230993007|390772001|231877006
over the course|288524001
of one week [18].|421379005|258705008|421379005|259038000

In 2012,
?duc'alcool,
a Quebec-based non-profit organization|224022006|21139007|224022006|418836005|21139007
that
aims
to
educate|409073007
the public
on the responsible use|394851003|277889008|394851003|419385000
of alcohol,|419442005|53041004|430837008
published
a report noting hangovers|229059009|229059009|32553006|223458004|223458004|32553006
have
long-lasting effects|255511005|253861007
that
inhibit|61511001
the drinker's capabilities
a full 24 hours|261015003|123027009|261015003|259029002
after heavy drinking [19].|410712002|160573003|410712002|30953006

Hangovers|32553006
are
poorly|556001
understood|66216009
from a medical point|74188005
of view.|246516004

Health care professionals
prefer|225773000
to
study|110465008|224699009
alcohol abuse|15167005
from a standpoint
of treatment|276239002|416118004
and
prevention,|169443000
and
there
is
a view|246516004
that
the hangover|32553006
provides
a useful, natural|510009
and
intrinsic disincentive|260521003|255406006
to excessive drinking.[21]|260378005|160573003|260378005|30953006

Within the limited amount|255469002|107651007
of serious study|42745003|110465008|42745003|224699009
on the subject,
there
is
debate
about
whether
a hangover|32553006
may
be
prevented|116699007
or
at least
mitigated|6736007
;
additionally,
there
is
a vast body|279495008|123037004
of folk medicine|410942007
and
simple quackery.|13673007

There
is
currently|15240007
no empirically proven mechanism|277025001|257544000
for prevention|169443000
except reducing|260400001
the amount|107651007
of ethanol|419442005
consumed
,
or
for making
oneself
sober
other than waiting
for the body to|279495008|123037004
metabolize
ingested alcohol,|111984006|419442005|111984006|53041004|111984006|430837008
which
occurs|272120004
via oxidation|26694004
through the liver|10200004|181268008
before alcohol|419442005|53041004|430837008
leaves|90737002
the body.|279495008|123037004

A four-page literature review|421534005
in the _British Medical Journal_|74188005
concludes
:
"
No compelling evidence|18669006
exists
to
suggest
that
any conventional|255333006
or
complementary intervention|225334002
is
effective|255403003|254648000
for preventing|116699007
or
treating alcohol hangover.|28995006|32553006

The most effective way to|4757001|255403003|4757001|254648000
avoid
the symptoms
of alcohol|419442005|53041004|430837008
induced|16404004
hangover|32553006
is
to
avoid
drinking."[22]|160573003|30953006

Recommendations
for foods,|255620007
drinks|226465004
and
activities to|257733005
relieve|397855004
hangover symptoms|32553006

The ancient Romans,|223655008
on the authority
of Pliny
the Elder,|15737008|422164008
favored
raw owl's eggs|226885005|107109004|226885005|107107002
or
fried canary,[38]|227282006|396523001|264670000|227282006|396524007|264670000
while
the "Prairie Oyster" restorative,|257663006|90014002|257663006|230032003
introduced|127487003
at the 1878 Paris World Exposition,|7074004
calls
for raw egg yolk|226885005
mixed|26242008
with Worcestershire sauce,|227519005
Tabasco sauce,|227519005
salt and pepper.|387390002|103582004|387390002|412066006

By 1938,
the Ritz-Carlton Hotel|257629009
provided
a hangover remedy|32553006
in the form|246176004
of a mixture|272163001
of Coca-Cola|28000008|263977005
and
milk[39]|3718001|119321005|70813002
(Coca-Cola|28000008|263977005
itself
having
been
invented
,
by some accounts,
[40][41]|259031006
as a hangover remedy|32553006
).

Alcoholic writer Ernest Hemingway|228281002|308004006
relied
on tomato juice|226498009
and
beer.|53410008

Certain mixtures|17162000|272163001
were
developed
specifically
for the purpose.|363675004

The "Black Velvet"|315240009|413464008|15086000|371252007
consists
of equal parts|9726003|260726005
champagne
and
flat Guinness Stout,|6041008|226507008|226507008|257564005|226507008|226507008

A 1957 survey
by a Wayne State University folklorist|398070004|224871002
found|404684003
widespread belief|85333001
in the efficacy
of heavy fried foods,|410712002|227282006|255620007
tomato juice|226498009
and
sexual activity.[29]|365952006

Activities|257733005
said|66049007
to
be
restorative
include|55919000
a shower?
alternating|49572008
very hot|260358002|264018002

[43] exercise,|61686008
[44]_[unreliable source?_]|260753009
and
steambath
or
sauna
(
although
medical opinion|74188005
holds|421139008
this to
be
very dangerous,|260358002
as
the combination|89780004
of alcohol|419442005|53041004|430837008
and
hyperthermia|386661006|50177009

the likelihood|2931005
of dangerous cardiac arrhythmias.[45]
