An
*
*enterolith|197063004
*
*
is
a mineral concretion|87918000|384600008
or
calculus|384600008
formed|35810008
anywhere
in the gastrointestinal system.|86762007|122865005|373871007

Enteroliths|197063004
are
uncommon|103356009
and
usually incidental findings|261087003|404684003|261087003
but
,
once
found|404684003
,
they
require
at a minimum watchful waiting.|255605001|103705002|255604002|103705002

If there
is
evidence|18669006
of complications,|116223007
they
must
be
removed.|127485006

An enterolith|197063004
may
form|246176004
around a
*
*nidus
*
*,
a small foreign object|255507004|260787004
such as a seed,|264337003
pebble,
or
piece
of twine,
that
serves
as an irritant.|412453003|263789000

In this respect,
an enterolith forms|197063004|246176004
by a process|415178003
similar
to the creation|410615009
of a pearl.

An enterolith|197063004
is
not to
be
confused|286933003
with a gastrolith,
which
helps
digestion.|106079008

Equine enteroliths|35354009|197063004
are
found|404684003
by walking pastures|129006008
or
turning|282987006
over manure compost
piles|70153002
to
find
small enteroliths,|255507004|197063004
during necroscopy,
and
increasingly
during surgery|83578000
for colic.|73063007

Therefore,
the incidence
of asymptomatic enteroliths|84387000|197063004
is
unknown.|261665006

Equine enteroliths typically|35354009|197063004
are
smoothly spherical|34258004
or
tetrahedral,
[1]|260305007
consist
mostly
of the mineral struvite[1][2]|87918000|264928008
(ammonium magnesium phosphate,|259549000
and
have
concentric rings|255465008|257380004
of mineral|87918000
precipitated
around a nidus.[1][3]

Enteroliths|197063004
in horses|35354009
were
reported|229059009|223458004
widely
in the 19th century,
infrequently|84638005
in the early 20th century,|264499004
and
now increasingly.

They
have
also
been
reported|229059009|223458004
in zebras|9354008
:
five|421820001
in a zoo
in California[4]|224043007|25997004
and
one|421379005
in a zoo
in Wisconsin.|427726005

Struvite enteroliths|264928008|197063004
are
associated|47429007
with elevated pH|79169000
and
mineral concentrations|87918000|82742001
in the lumen.|113342003|342806003|398252006

In California,|224043007|25997004
struvite enteroliths|264928008|197063004
are
associated|47429007
also
with a high proportion|75540009|8212001|371879000|8212001
of alfalfa|18424005
in the feed|129007004
and
less
access|260507000
to grass pasture.|422304003

This association|263534001|272151006
has
been
attributed|246061005
to the cultivation
of alfalfa|18424005
on serpentine soils,|415555003
resulting|42752001
in high concentrations|75540009|82742001|371879000|82742001
of magnesium|72717003
in the alfalfa._[citation|18424005

In humans,|278412004
enteroliths|197063004
are
rare|84638005|103356009
and
may
be
difficult to|52925006
distinguish
from gall stones.|266474003|256896000|235919008

Their chemical composition|441900009
is
diverse,
and
rarely|103356009
can
a nidus
be
found.|404684003

A differential diagnosis|47965005
of an enterolith|197063004
requires
the enterolith,|197063004
a normal gallbladder,|300355005
and
a diverticulum.[7][8]|31113003

An enterolith typically|197063004
forms|246176004
within a diverticulum.|31113003

An enterolith|197063004
formed|35810008
in a Meckel's diverticulum sometimes|37373007
is
known|36692007
as a Meckel's enterolith.|197063004

Improper use|277889008|419385000
of magnesium oxide|419521006
as a _long-term_ laxative|372800002
has
been
reported|229059009|223458004
to
cause|23981006|134198009
enteroliths|197063004
and/or
medication bezoars.[9]|235681003

Most enteroliths|197063004
are
not apparent
and
cause|23981006|134198009
no complications.|116223007

However,
any complications|116223007
that
do
occur|272120004
are
likely to|2931005
be
severe.|24484000

Of these,
bowel obstruction|81060008
is
most common,[10]|4757001|72906007
followed|367409002
by ileus[11]
and
perforation.|263837003

Bowel obstruction|81060008
and
ileus typically
occur|272120004
when
a large enterolith|255509001|197063004
is
expelled
from a diverticulum|31113003
into the lumen.|113342003|342806003|398252006

Perforation typically|263837003
occurs|272120004
within the diverticulum.|31113003

Most human enteroliths|278412004|197063004
are
radiolucent|263850002
on plain X-rays.|168537006

They sometimes
can
be
visualized|255374006
on CT scans|77477000
without contrast
;
presence|386397008
of contrast
in the lumen|113342003|342806003|398252006
may
reveal|263857004
the enterolith|197063004
as a void.|28278009

Most often,|4757001|70232002
they
are
visualized|255374006
using|260676000
ultrasound.|359659005

Although
recent surveys|6493001
of enterolith composition|197063004
are
lacking,|41277001
one early review|421379005|264499004
notes
struvite|264928008
(
as
in equines|35354009
)
,
calcium phosphate,|44044007
and
calcium carbonate|387307005
and
reports|229059009|223458004
choleic acid.|54724002|104552002

Deoxycholic acid|78258003
and
cholic acid|17147002
have
also
been
reported.[13]|229059009|223458004

In simple cases|13673007|398241000|13673007|413769002
of obstruction,|26036001
where there
are
no complications,|116223007
a variety
of non-surgical|83578000
and
surgical techniques|83578000|272394005
are
used|394850002
to
remove|127485006
the enterolith.|197063004

These
include|55919000
crushing|60726007|410715000
the enterolith|197063004
and
milking
it
back
to the stomach|69695003|181246003
or
forward|255540008
to the colon,|263977005|302508007
surgical removal|118292001|128303001|128304007
via an uninvolved segment|49907008|264193005
of the gastrointestinal tract,|122865005|279972009
and
resection|118292001|128303001
of the involved segment.|248448006|264193005
