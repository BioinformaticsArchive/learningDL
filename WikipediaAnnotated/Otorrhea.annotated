*Otitis media|65363002
*
*
(Latin
is
inflammation|257552002
of the middle ear,|25342003|181185000
or
middle ear infection.|65363002

It
occurs|272120004
in the area|42798000
between the tympanic membrane|42859004|181180005
and
the inner ear,|302462009|181189006
including|55919000
a duct|343011009|91726008
known|36692007
as the eustachian tube.|91207004

It
is
one|421379005
of the two most common causes|420797005|72906007|134198009
of earache -|16001004
the other|74964007
being
otitis externa.|86981007|3135009

Diseases|64572001
other than ear infections|129127001
can
also
cause|23981006|134198009
ear pain,|16001004
including|55919000
cancers|363346000
of any
structure
that
shares
nerve supply|260917002
with the ear|117590005|1910005
and
shingles|4740000
which
can
lead|88488004
to herpes zoster oticus.|21954000

Though
painful, otitis media|22253000|65363002
is
not threatening
and
usually
heals|298005009
on its own
within 2?6 weeks.|260306008|258705008

When
the middle ear|25342003|181185000
becomes
acutely
infected
,
pressure builds|279046003|13543005|257893003
up
behind the eardrum|42859004
(tympanic membrane|42859004|181180005
)
,
frequently|70232002
causing|23981006
intense pain.|103370009|22253000

It
may
result|394617004
in _bullous myringitis_|33528003
(myring means "eardrum"|255586005|42859004
)
,
which means|255586005
that
the tympanic membrane|42859004|181180005
is
blistered|247464001
and
inflamed.[1]

In severe|24484000
or
untreated cases,|25265005|398241000|25265005|413769002
the tympanic membrane|42859004|181180005
may
rupture|415747007
,
allowing
the pus|11311000|119323008
in the middle ear space|25342003|181185000
to drain|32712000
into the ear canal.|84301002

If there
is
enough
of it,
this drainage|307488001|122462000
may
be
obvious.

Even
though
the rupture|415747007
of the tympanic membrane|42859004|181180005
suggests
a highly painful|75540009|22253000
and
traumatic process,|263904004|415178003
it
is
almost always
associated|47429007
with the dramatic relief|224978009
of pressure|279046003|13543005|257893003
and
pain.|22253000

In a simple case|13673007|398241000
of acute otitis media|3110003
in an otherwise healthy person,|263775005|125676002
the body's defenses|279495008|123037004
are
likely to|2931005
resolve
the infection
and
the ear drum nearly always heals.|42859004|298005009

Instead of the infection
and
eardrum perforation resolving,|60442001
however,
drainage|307488001|122462000
from the middle ear|25342003|181185000
can
become
a chronic condition.|90734009|260905004

As long|255511005
as there
is
active middle ear infection,|55561003|65363002
the eardrum|42859004
will
not heal.|298005009

The World Health Organization|263775005|21139007
defines
chronic suppurative otitis media (CSOM)|38394007
as "
a stage|21191007|371508000|261612004
of ear disease|25906001
in which there
is
chronic infection|177010002
of the middle ear cleft,|25342003|9094003|181185000|9094003
a non-intact tympanic membrane|249125003
(i.e.|42146005|22971001

perforated eardrum|60442001
)
and
discharge|307488001|58000006
(otorrhoea|162364004
)
,
for
at least
the preceding two weeks"|236874000|420797005|258705008
(
WHO 1998
).

(Notice WHO's use|277889008|419385000
of the term _serous_ to|256913008
denote
a bacterial process,|409822003|415178003
whereas
the same term|262126009
is
generally
used|394850002
by ear physicians|117590005|309343006|1910005|309343006
in the United States to|223688001
denote
simple fluid collection|13673007|32457005|13673007|33463005|13673007|255765007|13673007
within the middle ear|25342003|181185000
behind an intact eardrum.|11163003|42859004

_Chronic otitis media_|21186006
is
the term
used|394850002
by most ear physicians worldwide to|117590005|309343006|1910005|309343006
describe
a chronically
infected

Otitis media|65363002
is
most commonly|4757001
caused|23981006|134198009
by infection
with viral, bacterial,|409822003
or
fungal pathogens.|414561005|264418008

The most common bacterial pathogen|4757001|72906007|409822003|264418008
is
_Streptococcus pneumoniae_.|9861002

Others|74964007
include|55919000
_Pseudomonas aeruginosa_,|52499004
nontypeable _Haemophilus influenzae_,|44470000
and
_Moraxella catarrhalis_.|24226003

Among older adolescents|70753007|133937008
and
young adults,|84422007|133936004
the most common cause|4757001|72906007|134198009
of ear infections|129127001
is
_Haemophilus influenzae_.|44470000

Viruses|49872002
such as respiratory syncytial virus (RSV)
and
those that
cause|23981006|134198009
the common cold|82272006|54150009
may
also
result|394617004
in otitis media|65363002
by damaging|37782003
the normal defenses|17621005|258744000
of the epithelial cells|4212006|395202001
in the upper respiratory tract.|58675001|361381009

A major risk factor|255603008|80943009
for developing otitis media|65363002
is
Eustachian tube dysfunction,|69494008
which
leads|88488004|236874000
to the ineffective clearing
of bacteria|409822003
from the middle ear.|25342003|181185000

The bacterial infections|301811001
are
caused|23981006|134198009
by Trimeric Autotransporter Adhesins (TAA).

The UspA1 protein domain|88878007
is
a TAA|433068007
found|404684003
in the bacteria _Moraxella catarrhalis_|409822003|24226003
which
causes|134198009
middle ear infections|65363002
in humans.|278412004

TAAs|433068007
are
virulence factors
or
in other words,|74964007|255373000
an infective agent|36272005
that
infects
the host cell|4421005|362837007
by attaching|102491009
to them
and
secreting
the virulence factor
by a secretion pathway.[3]|46242002

The role
of the anti-_H.|79813007

influenzae_ vaccine|396425006
that children|410601007|160499008
are
regularly
given|419582001
is
to
prevent
invasive disease|10179008|64572001
such as meningitis|7180009
and
pneumonia.|205237003

This vaccine|398827000
is
active only|55561003
against strains|48532005|276768000
of serotype b,|276770009
which
has
been
found|404684003
to
cause|23981006|134198009
meningitis|7180009
and
pneumonia|205237003
in children|410601007|160499008
under five years,|421820001|258707000
with children|410601007|160499008
between 4|260308009
and
18 months|258706009
the most susceptible.|4757001|131196009

Isolates|46651001
of serotype b rarely|276770009|103356009
cause|23981006|134198009
otitis media.|65363002

Susceptibility|76522002|118588007
is
heritable,|255404009
though
the specific genetic markers|69658003|20889005
are
still
under investigation.|386053000

Casselbrant _
et
al._
found|404684003
in 2009
that
the "best-supported linkage regions|9096001|410673009|243114000|410673009
may
contain|42504009
susceptibility genes|76522002|67271001|118588007|67271001
that
influence
the risk|30207005
for recurrent/persistent OM.|255227004|223613004

Plausible candidates
in 17q12
include|55919000
AP2B1,
CCL5,
and
a cluster
of other CCL genes,|74964007|67271001
and
in 10q22.3,
SFTPA2."[5]

Typically,
acute otitis media|3110003
follows|367409002
a cold|285686007|82272006|84162001
:
after
a few days|57176003|258703001
of a stuffy nose,|68235000
the ear|117590005|1910005
becomes
involved|248448006
and
can
cause|23981006|134198009
severe pain.|76948002

The pain|22253000
will
usually
settle|128719006
within a day|258703001|259032004
or
two,|420797005
but
can
last
over a week.|258705008|259038000

Sometimes
the ear drum ruptures,|60442001
discharging|307488001|58000006
pus|11311000|119323008
from the ear,|117590005|1910005
but
the ruptured drum|415747007|263862003
will
usually
heal|298005009
rapidly.|418694008

Pathophyisiology / progression|246453008|246450006
of acute otitis media|3110003
:
the tissues|85756007
surrounding|355648006
the Eustachian tube swell|91207004|423666004|91207004|442672001
due to an upper respiratory infection,|54150009
allergies,|421961002
or
dysfunction|386585008
of the tubes.|83059008|418530008

The Eustachian tube remains|91207004
blocked|26036001|112232007
most
of the time.|410669006

The air present|417696007|52101004|417696007|246105001
in the middle ear|25342003|181185000
is
slowly|419443000
absorbed
into the surrounding tissues.|355648006|85756007

A strong negative pressure|260404005|260385009|279046003|260404005|260385009|13543005|260404005|260385009|257893003
creates
a vacuum|81547007
in the middle ear,|25342003|181185000
and
eventually
the vacuum|81547007
reaches|282679008
a point
where fluid|32457005|33463005|255765007
from the surrounding tissues|355648006|85756007
accumulates
in the middle ear.|25342003|181185000

This
is
seen
as a progression|246453008|246450006
from a Type A tympanogram|261664005
to a Type C|261664005
to a Type B tympanogram.|261664005

The fluid|32457005|33463005|255765007
may
become
infected.

It
has
been
found|404684003
that dormant bacteria|409822003
behind the tympanic membrane|42859004|181180005
(eardrum|42859004
)
multiply|421206002
when
the conditions|260905004
are
ideal,
infecting
the middle ear fluid.|247261006

Children|410601007|160499008
younger|84422007
than seven|420359007
are
much more prone|242762006|1240000|4757001|1240000
to otitis media|65363002
due to shorter Eustachian tubes,|359530003|91207004|367450005|91207004
which
are
at a more horizontal angle|242762006|24020000|1483009
than
in the adult ear.|133936004|117590005|133936004|1910005

They also
have
not
developed
the same resistance|262126009|30714006
to viruses|49872002
and
bacteria|409822003
as adults.|133936004

Numerous studies|260396001|110465008|260396001|224699009
have
shown
correlation
between the incidence
in children|410601007|160499008
with various factors|256220008
such as nursing|169741004|265937000
in infancy,|3658006
bottle feeding|40043006|228946009|288996002|268472006
when
supine, parental smoking,|40199007|40683002|365981007
diet,|41829006
allergies,|421961002
and
automobile emissions|71783008|81059003
;
but
the most obvious weakness|4757001|13791008|4757001|4757001|260407003
of such
studies|110465008|224699009
is
the inability to
control|31509003
the variable|255372005
of exposure|71677004|24932003
to viral agents|260872001
during the studies_[citation|110465008|224699009

of life|224130005
is
associated|47429007
with a reduction|58294000|260400001|289928003
in the number,|410680006|410681005
and
duration|103335007

Acute otitis media|3110003
is
usually
diagnosed|439401001
via visualization
of the tympanic membrane|42859004|181180005
in combination|89780004
with the appropriate clinical history.|58147004|58147004|392521001

The use|277889008|419385000
of a monocular otoscope|60957001
and
perhaps
a tympanometer
may
not
be
able to|371150009
distinguish
bacterial|409822003
versus
viral etiology,|134198009
especially
if
the canal|3262009|257577001
is
small|255507004
and
there
is
wax|69637009|41508009

obscures
a clear view|263707001|246516004

can
cause|23981006|134198009
the eardrum to|42859004
look|386548000
inflamed
due to distension|25322007

on it,
mimicking
the redness|386713009|371240000

The occurrence,|272120004

is
most often purely viral|4757001|70232002

self-limited,|255469002

it usually
accompanies
viral URI|54150009

*Otitis media with effusion (OME)
*
*,
also
called
serous or secretory otitis media (SOM)|256913008
or
*
*glue ear
*
*[11],
is
simply
a collection
of fluid|32457005|33463005|255765007
that
occurs|272120004
within the middle ear space|25342003|181185000
as a result|394617004
of the negative pressure|260385009|279046003|260385009|13543005|260385009|257893003
produced
by altered Eustachian tube function.|278459006

This
can
occur|272120004
purely
from a viral URI,|54150009
with no pain|22253000
or
bacterial infection,|301811001
or
it
can
precede|236874000
and/or
follow|367409002|421939007
acute bacterial otitis media.|3110003|409822003

Fluid|32457005|33463005|255765007
in the middle ear sometimes|25342003|181185000
causes|134198009
conductive hearing impairment,|343087000|15188001
but
only
when
it
interferes|78235001
with the normal vibration|17621005|271421005|17621005|33679000|258744000|271421005|258744000|33679000
of the eardrum|42859004
by sound waves.

Over weeks|258705008
and
months,|258706009
middle ear fluid|247261006
can
become
very thick|260358002|246703001
and
glue-|57126000
like
(thus
the name glue ear
)
,
which
increases|260366006
the likelihood|2931005
of its causing conductive hearing impairment.|23981006|343087000|23981006|15188001

Early-onset OME|264499004|77374008
is
associated|47429007
with feeding|129007004

increased|35105006|260366006
the duration|103335007
of OME
in the first two years|255216001|420797005|258707000|232714002|420797005|258707000
of life.[12]|224130005

Chronic suppurative otitis media|38394007
involves|248448006
a perforation|263837003
(hole
)
in the tympanic membrane|42859004|181180005
and
active bacterial infection|55561003|301811001
within the middle ear space|25342003|181185000
for several weeks|261028005|258705008
or
more.|242762006

There
may
be
enough
pus|11311000|119323008
that
it
drains|32712000
to the outside of the ear|261074009|117590005|261074009|1910005
(otorrhea|162364004

be
seen
on examination|5880005
using|260676000
a binocular microscope.|65473004

This disease|64572001
is
much more common|242762006|72906007|4757001|72906007
in persons|125676002
with poor Eustachian tube function.|11403006|278459006|255351007|278459006

Hearing impairment often|343087000|70232002|15188001|70232002
accompanies
this disease.|64572001

Adhesive otitis media|7699004
has
occurred|272120004
when
a thin retracted ear drum|18043004|37794007|42859004
becomes
sucked|90485000|288978006
into the middle ear space|25342003|181185000
and
stuck,
i.e.|42146005|22971001

adherent,
to the ossicles

Pneumococcal conjugate vaccines|398730001|76698003
when
given|419582001
during infancy decrease rates|3658006|260400001|3658006|260370003
of acute otitis media|3110003
by 6?7%
and
if
implemented
broadly
would
have
a significant public health benefit.|386134007|310115006

Evidence|18669006
does
not
support|9096001|243114000
zinc supplementation|86739005
as an effort to|19487008
reduce|260400001
otitis rates|43275000|129127001
except maybe
in those with severe malnutrition|20401003|421463005

Long term antibiotics,|255631004
while
they
decrease|260400001|260370003
rates
of infection
during treatment,|276239002|416118004
have
an unknown effect|261665006|253861007
on long term outcomes|394617004
such as hearing loss.|343087000|15188001

Certain factors|17162000
such as season,|21864008
allergy predisposition|408439002|76522002|421961002|76522002
and
presence|386397008
of older siblings|13157002
are
known|36692007
to
be
determinants
of recurrent otitis media|255227004|65363002
and
persistent middle ear effusions (MEE).

Previous history|9130008|9130008|392521001
of recurrence,|246455001
environmental exposure|276339004|71677004|276339004|24932003
to tobacco smoke,|102407002
use|277889008|419385000
of daycare,
and
lack|41277001
of breastfeeding|169741004
have
all
been
associated|47429007
with increased risk|35105006|30207005|260366006|30207005
of OM development,|223613004|278923009
recurrence,|246455001
and
persistent MEE.

[18] Breastfeeding|169741004
can
reduce|260400001
the rates
of OM|223613004
from 19%
to 6%
in children|410601007|160499008

with medicinal
or
surgical methods|83578000|260686004|83578000|272394005
are
necessary to
reduce|260400001
the recurrence|246455001
of OM|223613004
and
prevent
persistent MEE.

Oral|260548002
and
topical analgesics|373265006|359540000|373265006
are
effective to|255403003|254648000
treat|395077000
the pain|22253000
caused|23981006|134198009
by otitis media.|65363002

Oral agents|260548002|260872001
include|55919000
ibuprofen,|387207008
paracetamol|387517004
(acetaminophen|387517004

,
and
narcotics.

Topical agents|419487009
shown
to
be
effective|255403003|254648000
include|55919000
antipyrine|412090007
and
benzocaine ear drops.|387357002|385136004

Decongestants|417901007
and
antihistamines,|372806008
either
nasal|260540009

not
recommended
due to the lack|41277001

if
warranted
,
is
amoxicillin.|372687004

If there
is
resistance,|30714006
then amoxicillin-clavulanate|89519005
or
another penicillin derivative|373270004
plus
beta lactamase inhibitor|79744009|61511001
is
second line.|81170007|50009006|257997001|50009006|288495006|50009006

While
less
than 7 days|258703001
of antibiotics|255631004
have
less side effects more|276139006|263796003

Among short-course antibiotics,|359530003|288524001|255631004|367450005|288524001|255631004
long-acting azithromycin|255511005|387531004

found|404684003
more likely to|242762006|2931005
be
successful|385669000
than short-acting alternatives.[27]|359530003|367450005

In chronic cases|90734009|398241000|90734009|413769002

(also
called
a "grommet"|416735007

recurrence rates|246455001
in the 6 months|258706009
after placement[28]|257867005
but
have
little effect|253861007
on long term hearing.|47078008|118230007

Thus tubes|83059008|418530008
are
recommended
in those
who
have
more
than 3 episodes|260313008|272128006

Complementary and alternative medicine|350084001
is
not
recommended
for otitis media|65363002
with effusion|41699000|430869004

there
is
no evidence|18669006

evaluated
in one randomized controlled clinical trial|421379005|31509003|110465008

of acute otitis media|3110003
and
those suffering
from otitis media|65363002
with effusion|41699000|430869004
or
chronic otitis media,|21186006
have
higher risks|15508007
of developing conductive
and
sensorineural hearing loss.|60700002

This hearing loss|343087000|15188001
is
mainly
due to fluid|32457005|33463005|255765007
in the middle ear|25342003|181185000
or
rupture|415747007
of the tympanic membrane.|42859004|181180005

Prolonged duration|255224006|103335007
of otitis media|65363002
is
associated|47429007
with ossicular complications,|116223007
and
together with persistent tympanic membrane perforation|60442001
contributes
to the severity|272141005
of both
the disease|64572001
and
the hearing loss.|343087000|15188001

When
a cholesteatoma|363668000
or
granulation tissue|225541009
is
present|52101004|246105001
in the middle ear,|25342003|181185000
the degree|258395000|246173007
of hearing loss|343087000|15188001
and
ossicular destruction|64597002
is
even greater.[34]|263768009

Periods|259037005
of conductive hearing loss|44057004
from otitis media|65363002
may
have
a detrimental effect|253861007
on speech development|278923009
in children.|410601007|160499008

Recent studies|6493001|110465008|6493001|224699009
have
also linked otitis media|65363002
to educational problems,|4506002
attention disorders,|6769007|64572001
and
problems|55607006
with social adaptation.|52639008

Furthermore
it
has
been
demonstrated
that patients|116154003
suffering
from otitis media|65363002
have
more depression/anxiety-related disorders|242762006|231504006|272151006|64572001|242762006|231504006|262094002|64572001|242762006|197480006|272151006|242762006|197480006|262094002|242762006|35489007|197480006|272151006|242762006|35489007|197480006|262094002|242762006|366979004|197480006|272151006|242762006|366979004|197480006|262094002|242762006|255339005|197480006|272151006|242762006|255339005|197480006|262094002
compared
to individuals|125676002|385435006
with normal hearing.|162339002

Once the infections
resolve
and
hearing thresholds|89269003
return|7528007
to normal, childhood otitis media|17621005|68433009|65363002|258744000|68433009|65363002
may
still
cause|23981006|134198009
minor|410599005|255606000
and
irreversible damage|37782003
to the middle ear|25342003|181185000
and
cochlea.[38]|80169004|264670000|181187008|264670000

Otitis media|65363002
is
very common|260358002|72906007
in childhood,|68433009
with the average toddler
having
two|420797005
to three episodes|421291004|272128006
a year,|258707000|259039008
almost always
accompanied
by a viral upper respiratory infection (URI),|82272006
mostly
the common cold.|82272006|54150009

The rhinoviruses|90389005
(nose viruses|260540009|49872002|181195007|49872002
)
that
cause|23981006|134198009
the common cold|82272006|54150009
infect
the eustachian tube|91207004
that goes
from the back of the nose|84047001
to the middle ear,|25342003|181185000
causing|23981006
swelling|423666004|442672001
and
compromise
of pressure equalization,|279046003|13543005|257893003
which
is
one|421379005
of the normal functions|17621005|246464006|258744000|246464006
of the tube.|83059008

The other main function|74964007|63161005|246464006
is
the lateral drainage|49370004|307488001|49370004|122462000
of fluids|32457005|33463005
from tissues|85756007
on
either
side|182353008
of the skull.|89546000

It
has
to
be
remembered
that
the eustachian tube|91207004
is
only
the width|103355008
of three|421291004
to four|421534005
hairs|386045008
in places|257557008
along its length.|410668003

It also
changes|243326001|263703002
its anatomical|36298004
and
physiological appearance|1360005|386548000|1360005|255412001
during the early growth period|264499004|259037005
of the child.|410601007|160499008

In the newborn|133933007|46068001|255407002
the tube|83059008
is
horizontal making|24020000
it more difficult to|242762006|52925006
drain|32712000
naturally,
and
the surface|410678000
of the tube|83059008
is
100% cartilage,|61496007
with a lining|50009006
of lymphatic tissue|6969002
which
is
an extension|255536004
of the adenoidal tissue|55940004|85756007
from the back of the nose.|84047001

As the early years|264499004|258707000
pass
by,
the superior|261183002
(upper|261183002
)
part|260726005
of the tube ossifies|83059008
to bone|272673000|3138006|90780006|128530007
but
the lower|261122009
remains
the same.|262126009

The angle|1483009
of the tubes|83059008|418530008
changes|243326001|263703002
and
descends|75294000
to roughly
a 45 degree angle|258395000|1483009|246173007|1483009
increasing|260369004
the downward flow|255518004
of fluids.|32457005|33463005

Individuals|125676002|385435006
with Down syndrome|41040004
(DS
)
anatomically
have
more severe curves|242762006|24484000|60301000
to their tubes,|83059008|418530008
hence DS children|410601007|160499008
tend
to
have
more grommet operations|242762006|416735007|83578000
than other children.|74964007|410601007|74964007|160499008

In general,|60132005
the more severe|242762006|24484000
and
prolonged|255224006
the compromise
of eustachian tube function,|278459006
the more severe|242762006|24484000
the consequences|103332005
are
to the middle ear|25342003|181185000
and
its delicate structures.

If
a person|125676002
is
born|106970005|81827009|398209006
with poor eustachian tube function,|11403006|278459006|255351007|278459006
this greatly
increases|260366006
the likelihood|2931005
of more frequent|242762006|70232002
and
severe episodes|24484000|272128006
of otitis media.|65363002

Progression|246453008|246450006
to chronic otitis media|21186006
is
much more common|242762006|72906007|4757001|72906007
in this group|261586004|160481000|389109008
of people,|125676002
who often|70232002
have
a family history|57177007
of middle ear pathology._[citation|25342003|394595002|181185000|394595002
