Ringbone|19305001
can
be
classified|73504009
by its location,|246267002
with "high ringbone"|75540009|19305001|371879000|19305001
occurring|272120004
on the lower part|261122009|260726005
of the large pastern bone|255509001|78756000|272673000|255509001|78756000|3138006|255509001|78756000|90780006|255509001|78756000|128530007
or
the upper part|261183002|260726005
of the small pastern bone.|255507004|78756000|272673000|255507004|78756000|3138006|255507004|78756000|90780006|255507004|78756000|128530007

"Low ringbone"|62482003|19305001|371880002|19305001
occurs|272120004
on the lower part|261122009|260726005
of the small pastern bone|255507004|78756000|272673000|255507004|78756000|3138006|255507004|78756000|90780006|255507004|78756000|128530007
or
the upper part|261183002|260726005
of the coffin bone.|370672003|410030004

High ringbone|75540009|19305001|371879000|19305001
is
easier|36203004
seen
than low ringbone,|62482003|19305001|371880002|19305001
as
low ringbone|62482003|19305001|371880002|19305001
occurs|272120004
in the hoof|18060009|410026002
of the horse.|35354009|388441000|388445009

However,
low ringbone|62482003|19305001|371880002|19305001
may
be
seen
if
it
becomes
serious,|42745003
as
it
creates
a bony bump|263686003
on the coronet|10348001
of the horse.|35354009|388441000|388445009

Ringbone usually|19305001
occurs|272120004
in the front legs|255549009|30021000
but
can
also
be
in the hind legs,|30021000
and
is
usually worse|230993007|390772001|231877006
in one leg|421379005|61685007|421379005|30021000|421379005|182281004|421379005|362793004
than the other.|74964007

Ringbone|19305001
is
most often|4757001|70232002
found|404684003
in mature horses,|34071009|35354009
especially
those
in intensive training.|118629009

:
The horse|35354009|388441000|388445009
will
have
a bony growth|263686003
around the pastern area,|78756000|42798000
and
the pastern|78756000
will
have
less mobility.|276139006|363803005|276139006|246197003|263796003|363803005|263796003|246197003

The horse|35354009|388441000|388445009
will
show
pain|22253000
when
the pastern joint|214226000
is
moved|384598002|370125004
or
rotated.|263861005

Early cases|264499004|398241000|264499004|413769002
will
have
a lameness score|16973004|278061009|275520000|278061009
of 1-2|303183002
out of 5,|264706000|264605009
with little|281411007|255507004
or
no bony swelling|263686003|423666004|263686003|442672001
seen
,
although
possibly|60022001
felt|285854004
when
compared
to the opposite pastern.|78756000

Lameness|16973004|275520000
will
worsen|230993007|390772001
to a grade 2-3
on a scale|19892000|278111002
of 5
as the ringbone worsens.|19305001|230993007|19305001|390772001

*
*Low ringbone|62482003|19305001|371880002|19305001
*
*
:
The horse|35354009|388441000|388445009
will
have
moderate lameness|6736007|16973004|6736007|275520000
(grade 2-3
)
,
even
in early cases,|264499004|398241000|264499004|413769002
because of the closeness|29179001
of the ringbone|19305001
to the other structures|74964007
in the hoof.|18060009|410026002

When
severe|24484000
or
very|260358002
advanced,|86005002
the bony growth|263686003
will
be
able to|371150009
be
seen
on the coronet.|10348001

Ringbone|19305001
is
degenerative|33359002
(
unless
it
is
caused|23981006|134198009
by direct trauma|258136009
).

Treatment|276239002|416118004
works|261041009
to slow down|419443000|247524003
the progress|385651009
of the bony changes|263686003|243326001|263686003|263703002
and
alleviate
the horse's pain,|35354009|22253000|388441000|22253000|388445009|22253000
rather than
working to|261041009
cure
it.

*Shoeing|61533004
*
*
:
The farrier|308321006
should
balance|249982003|78933003|282295000
the hoof|18060009|410026002
and
apply|410618006|417924000
a shoe|43983001
that
supports|9096001|243114000
the heels|76853006
and
allows
for an easy breakover.|36203004

Closely
followed|367409002
-
up corrective trimming|8378006
by a qualified barefoot trimmer|111960003
can
also
help
to
alleviate
the pain.|22253000

*
*NSAIDs|372665008
*
*
:
or
non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs|372665008
help
to
alleviate
the pain|22253000
and
reduce|260400001
inflammation|257552002
within
and
around the joints.|39352004|81087007

Often NSAIDs|70232002|372665008
make
the horse comfortable enough to|35354009|388441000|388445009
continue|255238004
ridden work,|261041009
which
is
good|20572008
for the horse's overall health.|35354009|263775005|388441000|263775005|388445009|263775005

*
*
:
The pastern joint|214226000
can
be
injected|422145002
directly,
typically
with a form|246176004
of corticosteroid|79440004
and
hyaluronic acid.|38218009

A high intensity|75540009|103370009|371879000|103370009
specialized|67995009
percussion device|75180006|303607000|75180006|49062001
can
help
to
remodel
new bone tissue|7147002|3138006
and
decrease pain.|260400001|22253000|260370003|22253000

*
*Arthrodesis|19578002
*
*
:
the fusion|31883006|122501008
of the two bones|420797005|272673000|420797005|128530007
of the pastern joints|214226000
eliminates
the instability|410728007
of the joint,|39352004|81087007|302536002
and
thus
the inflammation.|257552002

This procedure|71388002
may
then
eliminate
the horse's|35354009|388441000|388445009
lameness|16973004|275520000
as well.|20572008

However,
surgical alteration|83578000
of the joint|39352004|81087007|302536002
can
promote
the growth
of bone|272673000|3138006|90780006|128530007
in the area,|42798000
which
is
cosmetically displeasing.

Arthrodesis|19578002
of the coffin joint|370892008
is
usually
not
performed|398166005
due to the location|246267002
of the joint|39352004|81087007|302536002
(
within the hoof|18060009|410026002
)
and
because
the coffin joint|370892008
needs|410525008|103325001
some mobility|363803005|246197003
for the horse to|35354009|388441000|388445009
move|302000008|384598002|370125004
correctly
(
unlike the pastern joint,|214226000
which
is
very still|260358002
).

If
the ringbone|19305001
is
close|29179001
to a joint,|39352004|81087007|302536002
the prognosis|20481000
for the horse's continued athletic use|35354009|255238004|277889008|35354009|255238004|419385000|388441000|255238004|277889008|388441000|255238004|419385000|388445009|255238004|277889008|388445009|255238004|419385000
is
not
as good|20572008
as if
the ringbone|19305001
is
not
near a joint.|39352004|81087007|302536002

Ringbone|19305001
that
is
progressing|255314001
rapidly|418694008
has
a poorer prognosis|170969009
as well.|20572008

Horses|35354009
that
are
not
performing|398166005
strenuous work,|261041009
such as jumping|9251003
or
working|261041009
at speed,
will
probably
be
usable|277889008|419385000
for years to|258707000
come.

However,
horses|35354009
competing
in intense sports|103370009|415577004
may
not
be
able to|371150009
continue|255238004
at their previous level,|9130008|258395000|9130008|276625007
as
their pastern joints|214226000
are
constantly
stressed.|262188008
