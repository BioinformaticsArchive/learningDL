American
and
British spelling differences,|83166007|263735002
is
the loss
of blood|87612001|119273009
or
blood escape|87612001|119273009
from the circulatory system.|113257007

Bleeding|131148009
can
occur|272120004
internally,|260521003
where blood leaks|87612001|87952002|119273009|87952002
from blood vessels|59820001
inside the body,|279495008|123037004
or
externally,|261074009
either
through a natural opening|510009|56116003
such as the mouth,|74262004|123851003|21082005|181220002
nose,|260540009|181195007
ear,|117590005|1910005
vagina|76784001|181441005
or
anus,|53505006|181262009
or
through a break in
the skin.|119325001|39937001|181469002

Desanguination
is
a massive blood loss,|112648003
and
the complete loss|255594003
of blood|87612001|119273009
is
referred to|439980006
as
exsanguination.|48149007

Typically,
a healthy person|263775005|125676002
can
endure
a loss
of 10?15%
of the total blood volume|268384009
without serious medical difficulties,|42745003|74188005|371157007
and
blood donation typically
takes|419652001
8?10%
of the donor's blood volume.[3]|105470007|118565006|105470007|419569009|118565006|419569009|16086006|105468003|16086006

Hemorrhaging|131148009
is
broken down|263690001
into four classes|421534005|258391009
by the American College|224864007
of Surgeons' Advanced Trauma Life Support (ATLS).[4]|304292004|243185007|304292004|243185007

This system|246333005
is
basically
the same|262126009
as
used|394850002
in the staging|72589006
of hypovolemic shock.|39419009

Individuals|125676002|385435006
in excellent physical|425405005|5880005|425405005|19388002
and
cardiovascular shape|113257007|107644003|113257007|246176004|113257007|300842002
may
have
more effective compensatory mechanisms|242762006|255403003|257544000|242762006|254648000|257544000
before experiencing cardiovascular collapse.|27942005

These patients|116154003
may
look|386548000
deceptively stable,|58158008
with minimal derangements|255605001|255604002
in vital signs,|61746007|46680005
while
having
poor peripheral perfusion.|11403006|248750004|255351007|248750004

Elderly patients|105436006|116154003
or
those
with chronic medical conditions|90734009|74188005|78326006|90734009|74188005|260905004
may
have
less tolerance|276139006|228432001|276139006|77472006|276139006|71412006|263796003|228432001|263796003|77472006|263796003|71412006
to blood loss,|131148009|250771004
less ability to|276139006|371150009|263796003|371150009
compensate|17275008
,
and
may
take|419652001
medications|410942007
such as betablockers|373254001
that
can
potentially blunt
the cardiovascular response.|113257007

Care
must
be
taken|419652001
in the assessment|386053000
of these patients.|116154003

The World Health Organization|263775005|21139007
made
a standardized grading scale to|258349007|19892000|258349007|278111002|371469007|19892000|371469007|278111002
measure|246445000|272391002
the severity|272141005
of bleeding.[5]|131148009

Bleeding|131148009
arises|68727004
due to
either
*
*traumatic injury
*
*,
underlying|255546002
*
*medical condition|74188005|260905004
*
*,
or
a
*
*combination|89780004
*
*.

Traumatic bleeding|263904004|131148009
is
caused|23981006|134198009
by some type|261664005
of injury.

There
are
different types|263735002|261664005
of wounds|13924000
which
may
cause|23981006|134198009
traumatic bleeding.|263904004|131148009

These
include|55919000
:

The pattern|272135003
of injury,
evaluation|386053000
and
treatment|276239002|416118004
will
vary
with the mechanism|257544000
of the injury.

Blunt trauma|425359009
causes|134198009
injury
via a shock effect|27942005|253861007
;
delivering energy|248272003
over an area.|42798000

Wounds|13924000
are
often|70232002
not straight|262185006
and
unbroken skin|119325001|39937001|181469002
may
hide|421332005
significant injury.|386134007

Penetrating trauma|53568006|53568006
follows|367409002
the course|288524001
of the injurious device.|303607000|49062001

As the energy|248272003
is
applied|410618006
in a more focused fashion,|242762006|87017008|242762006|363702006
it
requires
less energy to|276139006|248272003|263796003|248272003
cause|23981006|134198009
significant injury.|386134007

Any body organ,|113343008|272625005
including|55919000
bone|272673000|3138006|90780006|128530007
and
brain,|12738006|258335003
can
be
injured
and
bleed.|131148009

Bleeding|131148009
may
not
be
readily apparent
;
internal organs|260521003|410653004
such as the liver,|10200004|181268008
kidney|64033007|17373004|181414000
and
spleen|78961009|181279003
may
bleed|131148009
into the abdominal cavity.|52731004|361294009

The only apparent signs|50607009|72670004|420295001|72670004
may
come
with blood loss.|131148009|250771004

Bleeding|131148009
from a bodily orifice,|264114003
such as the rectum,|34402009|181261002
nose,|260540009|181195007
ears|117590005|1910005
may
signal|38952000
internal bleeding,|260521003|131148009
but
cannot
be
relied
upon.

Bleeding|131148009
from a medical procedure also|50731006
falls|1912002
into this category.

'Medical bleeding'|74188005|131148009
denotes
hemorrhage|131148009
as a result|394617004
of an underlying medical condition|74188005|260905004
(i.e.|42146005|22971001

causes|134198009
of bleeding|131148009
that
are
not directly
due to trauma
).

Blood|87612001|119273009
can
escape
from blood vessels|59820001
as a result|394617004
of 3 basic patterns|260313008|272135003|260313008|418836005|272135003
of injury
:

The underlying scientific basis|418836005
for blood clotting|75753009
and
hemostasis|74848003
is
discussed
in detail
in the articles,
Coagulation,|129390001
hemostasis|74848003
and
related articles.|272151006|262094002

The discussion here|223482009
is
limited|255469002
to the common practical aspects|72906007
of blood clot formation|396339007|11798007|396339007|255277001|75753009|11798007|75753009|255277001
which
manifest|250255003
as bleeding.|131148009

Certain medical conditions|17162000|74188005|260905004
can
also
make
patients|116154003
susceptible|131196009
to bleeding.|131148009

These
are
conditions|78326006|260905004
that
affect|4065008
the normal "hemostatic" functions|71269007
of the body.|279495008|123037004

Hemostasis|74848003
involves|248448006
several components.|261028005|246093002

The main components|63161005|246093002
of the hemostatic system|74848003|246333005|372681003|246333005
include|55919000
platelets|16378004
and
the coagulation system.|246333005|129390001|246333005

Platelets|16378004
are
small blood components|255507004|54790000|255507004|261226001
that
form|246176004
a plug|303480007
in the blood vessel wall|59820001|224727009|361097006|224727009
that stops bleeding.|260890000|131148009

Platelets also|16378004
produce
a variety
of substances|105590001
that
stimulate
the production
of a blood clot.|396339007|75753009

One|421379005
of the most common causes|4757001|72906007|134198009
of increased bleeding risk|35105006|131148009|30207005|260366006|131148009|30207005
is
exposure|71677004|24932003
to non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs|372665008
(
or
"NSAIDs"|372665008
).

The prototype
for these drugs|410942007
is
aspirin,|387458008
which
inhibits|61511001
the production
of thromboxane.|80946001

NSAIDs|372665008
inhibit|61511001
the activation
of platelets,|16378004
and
thereby
increase|260366006
the risk|30207005
of bleeding.|131148009

The effect|253861007
of aspirin|387458008
is
irreversible
;
therefore,
the inhibitory effect|61511001|253861007
of aspirin|387458008
is
present|52101004|246105001
until the platelets|16378004
have
been
replaced|282089006|370124000
(about ten days|23067006|258703001|420258001|258703001
).

Other NSAIDs,|74964007|372665008
such as "ibuprofen"|387207008
(Motrin|387207008
)
and
related drugs,|272151006|410942007|262094002|410942007
are
reversible|35174006
and
therefore,
the effect|253861007
on platelets|16378004
is
not
as long-lived.|255511005|224130005|255511005|419749002

There
are
several named coagulation factors|261028005|27468005|350475008
that
interact
in a complex way to|103360007
form|246176004
blood clots,|75753009
as
discussed
in the article
on coagulation.|129390001

Deficiencies|260372006|248325000
of coagulation factors|350475008
are
associated|47429007
with clinical bleeding.|58147004|131148009

For instance,
deficiency|260372006|248325000
of Factor VIII|416523005
causes|134198009
classic Hemophilia A|28293008|255301002|28293008|255333006|28293008
while
deficiencies|260372006|248325000
of Factor IX cause "Christmas disease"|54378000|134198009|41788008
(hemophilia B.|41788008

Antibodies|68498002
to Factor VIII|416523005
can
also
inactivate
the Factor VII|30804005
and
precipitate
bleeding|131148009
that
is
very difficult to|260358002|52925006
control.|31509003

This
is
a rare condition|84638005|260905004|103356009|260905004
that
is
most likely to|4757001|2931005
occur|272120004
in older patients|70753007|116154003
and
in those with autoimmune diseases.|20401003|85828009|421463005|85828009

von Willebrand disease|128105004
is
another common bleeding disorder.|72906007|362970003|72906007|248250000

It
is
caused|23981006|134198009
by a deficiency|260372006|248325000
of
or
abnormal function|263654008|246464006
of the "von Willebrand" factor,|18288009
which
is
involved|248448006
in platelet activation.|58301003

Deficiencies|260372006|248325000
in other factors,|74964007
such as factor XIII|51161000
or
factor VII|30804005
are
occasionally
seen
,
but
may
not
be
associated|47429007
with severe bleeding|24484000|131148009
and
are
not
as
commonly
diagnosed.|439401001

In addition|260364009
to NSAID-related bleeding,|372665008|272151006|131148009|372665008|262094002|131148009
another common cause|72906007|134198009
of bleeding|131148009
is
that
related|272151006|262094002
to the medication,|410942007
warfarin|372756006
("Coumadin"|63167009
and
others|74964007
).

This medication|410942007
needs|410525008|103325001
to
be
closely
monitored|302805002|13288007
as the bleeding risk|131148009|30207005
can
be
markedly|46998006
increased|35105006|260366006
by interactions
with other medications.|74964007|410942007

Warfarin|372756006
acts
by inhibiting|61511001
the production
of Vitamin K|65183007
in the gut.|122865005

Vitamin K|65183007
is
required
for the production
of the clotting factors,|350475008
II,
VII,|262269006
IX,
and
X
in the liver.|10200004|181268008

One|421379005
of the most common causes|4757001|72906007|134198009
of warfarin-related bleeding|372756006|272151006|131148009|372756006|262094002|131148009
is
taking antibiotics.|419652001|255631004

The gut bacteria|122865005|409822003
make
vitamin K|65183007
and
are
killed|248007002
by antibiotics.|255631004

This decreases vitamin K levels|260370003|65183007|258395000
and
therefore
the production
of these clotting factors.|350475008

Deficiencies|260372006|248325000
of platelet function|417313007
may
require
platelet transfusion|12719002
while
deficiencies|260372006|248325000
of clotting factors|350475008
may
require
transfusion|303955003|116859006|5447007
of
either
fresh frozen plasma|346447007
or
specific clotting factors,|69658003|350475008
such as Factor VIII|416523005
for patients|116154003
with hemophilia.|28293008|90935002|408442008
