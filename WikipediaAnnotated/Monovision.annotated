The word _presbyopia_|255373000|41256004
comes
from the Greek word _presbys_|1451003|255373000
(???????
)
,
meaning|255586005
"old man"|70753007|248153007|70753007|339947000|70753007|278412004
or
"elder",|15737008|422164008
and
the Neo-Latin suffix _-opia_,
meaning|255586005
"sightedness",|281004000
[2]|260306008
giving|419582001
rise
to the laymen's definition often|70232002
seen
in consumer articles
or
medical glossaries,|74188005
"old eyes".[3]|70753007|81745001

The first symptoms most people notice|255216001|125676002|232714002|125676002
are
difficulty|371157007
reading|50360004
fine print,|3082000
particularly
in low light conditions,|62482003|56242006|260905004|62482003|371268001|260905004|371880002|56242006|260905004|371880002|371268001|260905004
eyestrain|70323002
when
reading|50360004
for long periods,|255511005|259037005
blur
at near|277752003
or
momentarily blurred vision|246636008
when
transitioning
between viewing distances.|246516004|246132006

Many extreme presbyopes|12565001
complain
that
their arms|40983000
have
become
"too short" to|359530003|367450005
hold|421139008
reading material|50360004|260769002
at a comfortable distance.[4]|246132006

Presbyopia symptoms,|41256004
like other focus defects,|74964007|87017008|6920004|74964007|363702006|6920004
become
much less noticeable|242762006|4757001
in bright sunlight|221668007|49926000
due to the action|129264002
of the iris closing|41296002|29179001|27527003|29179001|181164000|29179001
to a smaller diameter.|263796003|81827009|255507004|81827009

As
with any lens,|78076003|181169005
increasing|260369004
the focal ratio|87017008|118586006
of the lens|78076003|181169005
increases|260366006
depth|131197000
of field|255798002
by reducing|260400001
the level|258395000|276625007
of blur
of out-of-focus objects|87017008|260787004|363702006|260787004
(
compare
the effect|253861007
of aperture
on depth|131197000
of field|255798002
in photography.|257444003

A delayed onset|77374008
of seeking correction
for presbyopia|41256004
has
been
found|404684003
among those with certain professions|20401003|17162000|14679004|20401003|255544004|14679004|421463005|17162000|14679004|421463005|255544004|14679004
and
those
with miotic pupils.|415219007

In particular, farmers|106388008
and
homemakers|444168002
seek
correction later,
whereas
service workers|115124001
and
construction workers|106524008
seek
eyesight correction earlier.|264499004

In optics,|81745001
the closest point|29179001
at which
an object|260787004
can
be
brought|68369002
into focus|87017008|363702006
by the eye|81745001|244486005
is
called
the eye's|81745001|244486005
*
*near point|251778004
*
*.

A standard near point distance|251778004|246132006
of 25 cm
is
typically
assumed
in the design
of optical instruments,|281004000|57134006
and
in characterizing optical devices|281004000|303607000|281004000|49062001
such as magnifying glasses.|50121007

Without correction,
the near point|251778004
is
at 3 inches|260313008|258677007
(7 cm
)
at age 10,|424144002
to 6 inches|258677007
(16 cm
)
at age 40,|424144002|259031006
to 39 inches|258677007
(1 meter|260305007|258669008
)
at age 60.|424144002

As a result,|394617004
a 60-year-old|258707000|70753007|259039008|70753007
must
use|277889008|419385000
corrective lenses to|78076003|181169005
read|50360004
books|278212002
or
magazines
at a comfortable distance.[7]|246132006

There
is
some confusion|286933003
in articles
and
even
textbooks
over|21481007
how
the focusing mechanism|251776000|257544000
of the eye actually works.|81745001|261041009|244486005|261041009

In the classic book,|255301002|278212002|255333006|278212002
_Eye|81745001|244486005
and
Brain_|12738006|258335003
by Gregory,
for example,
the lens|78076003|181169005
is
said to|66049007
be
suspended|385655000
by a membrane,|83097008
the 'zonula',
which
holds|421139008
it
under tension.|53489000

The tension|53489000
is
released,|68776005|129299003
by contraction|78558002
of the ciliary muscle,|9668006|280862009
to
allow
the lens to|78076003|181169005
become
more round,|242762006|42700002
for close vision.|29179001|281004000

This
implies
the ciliary muscle,|9668006|280862009
which
is
outside the zonula,
must
be
circumferential,|255593009|74551000
contracting|78558002
like a sphincter,
to
slacken
the tension|53489000
of the zonula pulling outwards|303370007|255543005
on the lens.|78076003|181169005

This
is
consistent|385433004
with the fact
that
our eyes|81745001
seem
to
be
in the 'relaxed' state|15166001|398070004
when
focusing|251776000
at infinity,
and
also
explains
why
no amount|107651007
of effort|19487008
seems
to
enable|225791005
a myopic person to|125676002
see|281004000
farther away.|46053002

Many texts,|260396001
though
,
describe
the 'ciliary muscles'|9668006
(
which
seem
more likely to|242762006|2931005
be
just elastic ligaments|52082005
and
not
under any form|246176004
of nervous control|31509003
)
as pulling|303370007
the lens taut|78076003|181169005
to focus|87017008|363702006
at close range._[citation|29179001
needed|410525008|103325001
_]
This
has
the counter-intuitive effect|303502004|85721008|253861007
of steepening
the lens valve cytokinesis centrally|78076003|23365005|181169005|23365005
(
increasing|260369004
its power|33300005
)
and
flattening peripherally.

Many people|260396001|125676002
with myopia|57190000
(near-sightedness|57190000
)
can
read|50360004
comfortably
without eyeglasses|50121007
or
contact lenses even|57368009
after
age 40.|424144002|259031006

However,
their myopia|57190000
does
not
disappear
and
the long-distance visual challenges|255511005|246132006|255374006
remain.

Myopes
considering
refractive surgery|373391005|420708009
are
advised|424900004
that surgically|83578000
correcting|370975003
their nearsightedness|57190000
may
be
a disadvantage
after age 40,|424144002|259031006
when
the eyes|81745001
become
presbyopic
and
lose
their ability to|371150009
accommodate
or
change focus,|243326001|87017008|243326001|363702006|263703002|87017008|263703002|363702006
because
they
will
then
need|410525008|103325001
to
use|277889008|419385000
glasses|50121007
for reading.|50360004

Myopes
with astigmatism|82649003
find
near vision|57190000|277752003
better,|3442003
though
not
perfect
,
without glasses|50121007
or
contact lenses|57368009
when
presbyopia|41256004
sets
in,
but
the more astigmatism,|242762006|82649003
the poorer|11403006|255351007
their uncorrected near vision.|281004000

A surgical technique|83578000|272394005
offered|410527000
is
to
create
a "reading eye"|50360004|81745001|50360004|244486005
and
a "distance vision eye",|246132006|281004000|81745001|246132006|281004000|244486005
a technique commonly|272394005
used|394850002
in contact lens practice,|52101004|57368009|18720000|57368009
known|36692007
as monovision.|414775001

Monovision|414775001
can
be
created
with contact lenses|57368009
or
spectacles,|50121007
so
candidates
for this procedure|71388002
can
determine
if
they
are
prepared
to
have
their corneas|28726007
reshaped
by surgery to|83578000
cause|23981006|134198009
this effect permanently.|253861007

Also
with aging,|248280005
some people|125676002
suffer
from
both
myopia|57190000
and
hypermetropia.|38101003

For those people,|125676002
both
type|261664005
of lenses|78076003|181169005
(concave
and
convex
)
are
used.|394850002

In the visual system,|49549006|281831001
images
captured
by the eye|81745001|244486005
are
translated
into electric signals|18213006
that
are
transmitted|60117003|258150004
to the brain|12738006|258335003
where they
are
interpreted.|363714003

As
such,
in order to
overcome
presbyopia,|41256004
two main components|420797005|63161005|246093002
of the visual system|49549006|281831001
can
be
addressed|397635003
:

the optical system|49549006|281831001
of the eye|81745001|244486005

These solutions|8537005
are
available thanks|103328004
to significant progress|386134007|385651009
in the understanding|66216009
of the human brain plasticity|278412004|12738006|417641001|278412004|258335003|417641001
and
the field|255798002
of perceptual learning.[8]|69998004

Corrective lenses|78076003|181169005
provide
a range
of vision correction,|281004000
some
as high|75540009|371879000
as

Some
with presbyopia|41256004
choose
varifocal
or
bifocal lenses to|397285001
eliminate
the need|410525008|103325001
for a separate pair|263869007
of reading glasses|50360004|50121007
;
specialized preparations|67995009|225106003|225106003
of varifocals
or
bifocals|397285001
usually
require
the services|224930009
of an optometrist.|28229004

Some newer bifocal|7147002|397285001
or
varifocal spectacle lenses|421591000
attempt
to correct
both
near|277752003
and
far vision|46053002|281004000
with the same lens.[9]|262126009|78076003|262126009|181169005

Contact lenses|57368009
can
also
be
used|394850002
to correct
the focusing loss|251776000
that
comes
along
with presbyopia.|41256004

Some people|125676002
choose
contact lenses|57368009
to correct one eye|421379005|81745001|421379005|244486005
for near|277752003
and
one eye|421379005|81745001|421379005|244486005
for far|46053002
with a method|260686004|272394005
called
monovision,|414775001
which
can
interfere|78235001
with depth perception|251763006
due to loss
of focusing ability|251776000|371150009
in the other eye.|74964007|81745001|74964007|244486005

Unlike the solutions|8537005
based|418836005
on perceptual learning,|69998004
targeted
on improving|385633008
the visual processing|311505004
in the brain,|12738006|258335003
the available solutions|103328004|8537005
based|418836005
upon exercising|61686008|229065009
the ciliary muscles|9668006

neither
scientific basis|418836005
nor
have
they
been
proved|277025001
effective.[10]|255403003|254648000

solutions|8537005
for those
who

INTRACOR[12]
has
now
been
approved|9571008
in Europe|223502009
for treatment|276239002|416118004
of
both
eyes|81745001
(turning|282987006
both
corneas|28726007
into multifocal lenses|397283008
and
so|223528007
dispensing
with the need|410525008|103325001
for reading glasses|50360004|50121007
).

Surgical treatments|83578000
that
reshape
the cornea,|28726007|181162001
such as PresbyLASIK
and
conductive keratoplasty,|397517002
are
also
worth consideration,
but
some
use|277889008|419385000
of reading glasses|50360004|50121007
will
still
remain
when
light|56242006|371268001

)
of each eye|81745001|244486005
is
increased.|35105006|260366006

As a result|394617004
of the increased depth|35105006|131197000|260366006|131197000
of field,|255798002
the brain|12738006|258335003
merges
the two images,|420797005
creating
a blend zone,
i.e.|42146005|22971001

a zone
which
is
in focus|87017008|363702006
for
both
eyes.|81745001

This
allows
the patient to|116154003
see|281004000
near,|277752003
intermediate|11896004
and
far|46053002
without glasses.|50121007

Some literature also
suggests
the benefits
achieved
include|55919000
the brain learning to|12738006|69998004|258335003|69998004
adapt

assimilating
two images,|420797005
one|421379005
of which
is
out of focus.|87017008|363702006

Over time,|410669006
many patients|116154003
report|229059009|223458004
they
are
unaware one eye|418107008|421379005|81745001|418107008|421379005|244486005|406124004|421379005|81745001|406124004|421379005|244486005
is

Surgically|83578000
implanted|40388003
corneal inlays|28726007
are
another treatment option|276239002|416118004
for presbyopia.|41256004

Corneal|28726007
inlays
typically
are
implanted|40388003
in the nondominant eye to|81745001|244486005
minimize
impact|134293005
to binocular uncorrected distance vision.|68362006|246132006

They
seek
to
improve|385425000|3442003|385633008
near vision|57190000|277752003
in one|421379005
of three ways|421291004
:
The Flexivue Microlens
(Presbia
)
changes|243326001|263703002
the central refractive index,|26216008|419205000
the Kamra
(AcuFocus
)
increases|260366006
the depth of focus|131197000|87017008|131197000|363702006
through the use|277889008|419385000
of a pinhole,|257492003
and
the Vue+
(Revision Optics|255231005|81745001|118635009|81745001|261560009|81745001
)
reshapes
the central cornea.[18]|244494003

Scientists' understanding|308027003|66216009
of the ability|371150009
of the adult brain to|133936004|12738006|133936004|258335003
change|243326001|263703002
,
termed neuroplasticity,|273999003
has
been
vastly
advanced|86005002
during the last 20 years,|258707000
giving|419582001
rise
to solutions|8537005
based|418836005
on perceptual learning.|69998004

Perceptual learning,|69998004
standing|10904000
for repeated practice|27582007
on a demanding task,
improves|385425000|3442003|385633008
visual skills|255374006
by enhancing
the image processing|363679005|415178003|278395004|415178003
in the brain.|12738006|258335003

Several great achievements|261028005|255509001|261028005|263768009
in this field|255798002
include|55919000
FDA-approved solutions|9571008|8537005
for severe visual problems|24484000|255374006|55607006
such as amblyopia,|387742006
loss
of vision|281004000
resulting|42752001
from a stroke,|230690007
and
others.|74964007

Academic research
on perceptual learning|69998004
has
been
published
in leading academic journals,|236874000
including|55919000
Nature,|277302009
Science,
PNAS,
Vision Research|281004000
and
others,|74964007
[19][20]
including|55919000
studies|110465008|224699009
showing
improved visual performance|385425000|255374006|3442003|255374006
in presbyopes.

Improvements
in visual functions|281004000
following|255260001
perceptual learning|69998004
are
achieved
without changing|243326001|263703002
the optical characteristics|281004000
of the presbyopic eye,|81745001|244486005
implying
enough retained plasticity|397909002|417641001
in the aging brain to|248280005|12738006|248280005|258335003
offset
the natural biological deterioration|510009|12893009
of the eyes.|81745001

Thus,
the unavoidable deterioration
of the eyes|81745001
with age|424144002
can
be
compensated|17275008
by boosting
the speed
and
quality|263496004
of image processing|363679005|415178003|278395004|415178003
in the visual cortex
of the brain.|12738006|258335003

Some
may
claim
that overcoming presbyopia|41256004
through image processing improvement|363679005|415178003|278395004|415178003
is
superior|261183002
to optical correction|281004000
for several reasons_[citation|261028005|410666004
