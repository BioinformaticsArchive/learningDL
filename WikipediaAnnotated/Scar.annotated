*Scars|70582006|275322007
*

are
areas|42798000
of fibrous tissue|34433006
(fibrosis|263756000
that
replace|282089006|370124000
normal skin|225544001
after injury.

A scar|70582006|275322007
results|394617004
from the biological process
of wound repair|298005009
in the skin|119325001|39937001|181469002
and
other tissues|74964007|85756007
of the body.|279495008|123037004

Thus,
scarring|275322007
is
a natural part|510009|260726005
of the healing process.|298005009|415178003|90910008|415178003

With the exception
of very minor lesions,|260358002|410599005|260358002|255606000
every wound|13924000
(e.g.|258795003

after accident,|55566008
disease,|64572001
or
surgery|83578000
results|394617004
in some degree|258395000|246173007
of scarring.|275322007

An exception
to this
is
animals|387961004
with regeneration,|34636005|278313005
which
do
not
form|246176004
scars|70582006|275322007
and
the tissue|85756007
will
grow
back exactly
as
before.|236874000|421718005

Scar tissue|70582006|275322007
is
the same protein|262126009|88878007
(collagen|61472002
)
as the tissue|85756007
that
it replaces,|282089006|370124000
[1]|260305007
but
the fiber composition|116272000|400293002|87028007|37202001
of the protein|88878007
is
different|263735002
;
instead of a random basketweave formation|255226008|11798007|255226008|255277001
of the collagen fibers|62183001
found|404684003
in normal tissue,|85756007|30389008
[1]|260305007
in fibrosis|263756000
the collagen cross-links|61472002|85952003
and
forms|246176004
a pronounced alignment
in a single direction.|125681006|260672003|50607009|260672003

This collagen scar tissue alignment|61472002|70582006|61472002|275322007
is
usually
of inferior functional quality|261089000|40143009|263496004|261089000|246464006|263496004
to the normal collagen|17621005|61472002|258744000|61472002
randomised
alignment.

For example,
scars|70582006|275322007
in the skin|119325001|39937001|181469002
are
less resistant|276139006|30714006|263796003|30714006
to ultraviolet radiation,|41355003
and
sweat glands|10410005
and
hair follicles|67290009
do
not
grow
back
within scar tissue.|70582006|275322007

A myocardial infarction,|22298006
commonly
known|36692007
as a heart attack,|22298006
causes|134198009
scar|70582006|275322007
formation|11798007|255277001
in the heart muscle,|74281007
which
leads|88488004|236874000
to loss
of muscular power|271708004
and
possibly heart failure.|60022001|84114007|60022001|42343007

However,
there
are
some tissues|85756007
(e.g.|258795003

bone|272673000|3138006|90780006|128530007
that
can
heal|298005009
without any structural
or
functional deterioration.|40143009|246464006

First|255216001|232714002
attested
in English|297487008|25804004
in late 14th century,|260383002
the word _scar_ derives|255373000|70582006|255373000|275322007
from Old French _escharre_,|70753007|19434008
from Late Latin _eschara_,|260383002
[3]|260313008
which
is
the latinisation
of the Greek ??????|1451003
(_eskhara_
)
,
meaning|255586005
"hearth,
fireplace",|30002008
but
in medicine "scab,|410942007|69640009
eschar|87319000
on a wound|13924000
caused|23981006|134198009
by burning|90673000|62404004
or
otherwise".[4][5]

All scarring|275322007
is
composed
of the same collagen|262126009|61472002
as the tissue|85756007
it
has
replaced|282089006|370124000
,
but
the composition
of the scar tissue,|70582006|275322007
compared
to the normal tissue,|85756007|30389008
is
different.|263735002

Scars|70582006|275322007
differ
from other scars|74964007|70582006|74964007|275322007
in the amounts|107651007
of collagen|61472002
overexpressed.

Labels
have
been
applied|410618006
to the differences|263735002
in overexpression.

Two|420797005
of the most common types|4757001|72906007|261664005
are
hypertrophic|56246009
and
keloid scarring,|33659008
[6]
both
of which
experience
excessive stiff collagen|260378005|61472002
bundled
growth
overextending
the tissue,|85756007
blocking|2899008|112232007
off regeneration|34636005|278313005
of tissues.|85756007

Another form|246176004
is
atrophic scarring|409766009
(sunken scarring|275322007
)
,
which also
has
an overexpression
of collagen blocking regeneration.|61472002|2899008|34636005|61472002|2899008|278313005|61472002|112232007|34636005|61472002|112232007|278313005

This scar type|70582006|261664005|275322007|261664005
is
sunken
,
because
the collagen bundles|61472002
do
not
overextend
the tissue.|85756007

Stretch marks|201066002|271674009
(striae|201066002
)
are
regarded
as scars|70582006|275322007
by some.

Hypertrophic scars|19843006
occur|272120004
when
the body|279495008|123037004
overproduces
collagen,|61472002
which
causes|134198009
the scar to|70582006|275322007
be
raised|260399008
above the surrounding skin.|355648006|119325001|355648006|39937001|355648006|181469002

Hypertrophic scars|19843006
take|419652001
the form|246176004
of a red raised lump|386713009|260399008|300848003|371240000|260399008|300848003
on the skin.|119325001|39937001|181469002

They usually
occur|272120004
within 4|260308009
to 8 weeks|258705008
following|255260001
wound infection|76844004
or
wound closure|13924000|112695004
with excess tension|260378005|53489000
and/or
other traumatic skin injuries.[6]|74964007|119325001|74964007|39937001|74964007|181469002

Keloid scars|33659008
are
a more serious form|242762006|42745003|246176004
of scarring,|275322007
because
they
can
grow
indefinitely
into large, tumorous|272419002
(
although
benign) neoplasms.[6]|20376005|92247009

Hypertrophic scars|19843006
are
often|70232002
distinguished
from keloid scars|33659008
by their lack|41277001
of growth
outside the original wound area,|19535007|13924000|42798000
but
this commonly
taught|264939006
distinction
can
lead|88488004
to confusion.|286933003

All keloid scars|33659008
are
hypertrophic,[6]|56246009
but
"only|50607009|420295001
a small percentage|255507004|118582008
of large scars"|255509001|70582006|255509001|275322007
are
keloid.|33659008

Phenotypic differences|263735002
exist
between keloid scars|33659008
and
other hypertrophic scars.|74964007|19843006

Keloid scars|33659008
can
occur|272120004
on anyone,
but
they
are
most common|4757001|72906007
in dark-skinned people.|255419005|39937001|125676002

They
can
be
caused|23981006|134198009
by surgery,|83578000
accident,|55566008
acne|88616000|11381005
or
,
sometimes,
body piercings.|279495008|123037004

In some people,|125676002
keloid scars|33659008
form|246176004
spontaneously.

Although
they
can
be
a cosmetic problem,|81024003|55607006|261513001|55607006
keloid scars|33659008
are
only inert masses|50607009|300848003|50607009|118538004|420295001|300848003|420295001|118538004
of collagen|61472002
and
therefore completely harmless
and
not cancerous.|363346000|372087000

However,
they
can
be
itchy|424492005
or
painful|22253000
in some individuals.|125676002|385435006

They
tend
to
be
most common|72906007
on the shoulders|16982005
and
chest.|261179002

Hypertrophic scars|19843006
and
its subset keloids|33659008
tend
to
be
more common|242762006|72906007
in wounds|13924000
closed|29179001
by secondary intention.[8]|2603003|367565008|2603003|361269008|81170007|367565008|81170007|361269008

An atrophic scar|409766009
takes|419652001
the form|246176004
of a sunken recess
in the skin,|119325001|39937001|181469002
which
has
a pitted appearance.|79261008|386548000|79261008|255412001|77855009|386548000|77855009|255412001

These
are
caused|23981006|134198009
when
underlying structures
supporting|9096001|243114000
the skin,|119325001|39937001|181469002
such as fat|271590003
or
muscle,|91727004
are
lost.

This type|261664005
of scarring|275322007
is
often|70232002
associated|47429007
with acne,|88616000|11381005
[9][10] chickenpox,|38907003
other diseases especially _Staphylococcus_|74964007|64572001|65119002
(
or
[MRSA infection],|266096002
surgery,|83578000
or
accidents.

Stretch marks|201066002|271674009
(technically
called
_striae_|201066002
)
are
also
a form|246176004
of scarring.|275322007

These
are
caused|23981006|134198009
when
the skin|119325001|39937001|181469002
is
stretched rapidly|386781001|418694008|122546009|418694008
(
for instance
during pregnancy,|289908002
[11] significant weight gain,|386134007|262286000
or
adolescent growth spurts,|133937008
[12]
or
when
skin|119325001|39937001|181469002
is
put
under tension|53489000
during the healing process,|298005009|415178003|90910008|415178003
(usually near joints.|39352004|81087007

This type|261664005
of scar usually|70582006|275322007
improves|385425000|3442003|385633008
in appearance|386548000|255412001
after a few years.[11]|57176003|258707000

Elevated corticosteroid levels|75540009|79440004|258395000
are
implicated
in striae development.[13]|201066002|278923009

If
a wound|13924000
becomes
covered|255334000
with epithelial tissue|31610004
within two weeks,|420797005|258705008
minimal collagen|255605001|61472002|255604002|61472002
will
be
deposited|46595003
and
no scar|70582006|275322007
will
form.|246176004

Generally,
if
a wound|13924000
takes|419652001
longer|255511005
than three|421291004
to four weeks to|421534005|258705008
become
covered,|255334000
a scar|70582006|275322007
will
form.|246176004

Deep second-degree burns|131197000|403191005
heal|298005009
with scarring|275322007
and
hair loss.|278040002

Sweat glands|10410005
do
not
form|246176004
in scar tissue,|70582006|275322007
which
impairs|260379002|40226000
the regulation
of body temperature.[15]|105723007

The scar|70582006|275322007
is
a result|394617004
of the body's repair mechanism|279495008|298005009|257544000|279495008|4365001|257544000|123037004|298005009|257544000|123037004|4365001|257544000
after injury
in many tissues.|85756007

Any injury
does
not
become
a scar|70582006|275322007
until the wound|13924000
has
completely
healed|90910008
;
this
can
take|419652001
many months,|258706009
or
years|258707000
in the worst pathological cases,|556001|394595002|398241000|556001|394595002|413769002|556001|29458008|398241000|556001|29458008|413769002|367391008|394595002|398241000|367391008|394595002|413769002|367391008|29458008|398241000|367391008|29458008|413769002|230993007|394595002|398241000|230993007|394595002|413769002|230993007|29458008|398241000|230993007|29458008|413769002|390772001|394595002|398241000|390772001|394595002|413769002|390772001|29458008|398241000|390772001|29458008|413769002|231877006|394595002|398241000|231877006|394595002|413769002|231877006|29458008|398241000|231877006|29458008|413769002
such as keloids.|33659008

To
begin|255395001
to
patch|1522000|262302002|385114002|386028003|413676000|421043009
the damage,|37782003
a clot|387325003|75753009
is
created
;
the clot|387325003|75753009
is
the beginning process|255395001|415178003
that results|394617004
in a provisional matrix.

In the process,|415178003
the first layer|255216001|232714002
is
a provisional matrix
and
is
not
scar.|70582006|275322007

Over time,|410669006
the wounded body tissue then|13924000|85756007
overexpresses
collagen|61472002
inside the provisional matrix to
create
a collagen matrix.|61472002

This collagen overexpression|61472002
continues|255238004
and
crosslinks|85952003
the fiber arrangement|116272000|103377007|400293002|103377007|87028007|103377007|37202001|103377007
inside the collagen matrix,|61472002
making
the collagen|61472002
dense.|255596001

This densely packed collagen,|255596001|53999001|61472002
morphing|373529000|116676008
into an inelastic whitish collagen[16]|61472002
scar|70582006|275322007
wall,|224727009
blocks|26036001
off cell communication|4421005|263536004|362837007|263536004
and
regeneration|34636005|278313005
;
as a result,|394617004
the new tissue|7147002|85756007
generated
will
have
a different texture|263735002|246200002
and
quality|263496004
than the surrounding unwounded tissue.|355648006|85756007

This prolonged collagen-producing process|255224006|61472002|415178003
results|394617004
in a fortuna scar.|70582006|275322007

The scarring|275322007
is
created
by fibroblast proliferation,|52547004|30217000
[16]
a process|415178003
that
begins|255395001
with a reaction|263851003
to the clot.[17]|387325003|75753009

To
mend
the damage,|37782003
fibroblasts slowly|52547004|419443000
form|246176004
the collagen scar.|61472002|70582006|61472002|275322007

The fibroblast proliferation|52547004|30217000
is
circular[18]|354652004
and
cyclically,
the fibroblast proliferation|52547004|30217000
lays
down thick, whitish collagen[16]|246703001|61472002
inside the provisional
and
collagen matrix,|61472002
resulting|42752001
in the abundant production
of packed collagen|53999001|61472002
on the fibers[16][17][19]|400293002|37202001
giving|419582001
scars|70582006|275322007
their uneven texture.|246200002

Over time,|410669006
the fibroblasts|52547004
continue|255238004
to crawl|282609009
around the matrix,
adjusting|410617001
more fibers|242762006|400293002|242762006|37202001
and
,
in the process,|415178003
the scarring settles|128719006|275322007|128719006
and
becomes
stiff.

This fibroblast proliferation also|52547004|30217000
contracts|78558002
the tissue.|85756007

In unwounded tissue,|85756007
these fibers|400293002|37202001
are
not
overexpressed
with thick collagen|246703001|61472002
and
do
not
contract.|78558002

The fibroblast|52547004
involved|248448006
in scarring|275322007
and
contraction|78558002
is
the myofibroblast,|56790003
[22]
which
is
a specialized contractile fibroblast.|67995009|12140005|52547004|12140005|52547004

These cells|4421005
express
a-smooth muscle actin|122447002|46583003
(
a-SMA|5262007
).[24]

The myofibroblasts|56790003

and
in adult unwounded tissues|133936004|85756007
where the fibroblast|52547004
in itself
is
arrested|397829000|6155003
;
however,
the myofibroblast|56790003
is
found|404684003
in massive numbers|46998006|410680006|46998006|410681005
in adult wound healing|133936004|298005009
which
heals|298005009
with a scar.[23]|70582006|264657009|275322007|264657009

The myofibroblasts make up|56790003|255532002|56790003|353734004
a high proportion|75540009|8212001|371879000|8212001
of the fibroblasts|52547004
proliferating
in the postembryonic wound|13924000
at the onset|77374008
of healing.|298005009|90910008

In the rat model,|371565004|371564000
for instance,
myofibroblasts|56790003
can
constitute
up to 70%
of the fibroblasts,|52547004
[22]
and
is
responsible|394851003
for fibrosis|263756000
on tissue.|85756007

Generally,
the myofibroblasts|56790003
disappear
from the wound|13924000
within 30 days,|258703001
[27]
but
can
stay
around
in pathological cases|394595002|398241000|394595002|413769002|29458008|398241000|29458008|413769002
in hypertrophy,|56246009
such as keloids.[23][27]|33659008|264657009

Prolonged inflammation,|255224006|257552002

the fibroblast proliferation[16]|52547004|30217000
can
occur.|272120004

Collagen induction therapy (CIT)|61472002|16404004|276239002
is
an aesthetic medical procedure|106148006|50731006|271712005|50731006|272144002|50731006
that

repeatedly|27582007
puncturing|11639007|85921004
the skin|119325001|39937001|181469002
with tiny,
sterile needles.|261029002|79068005|15296000|79068005

Typically,
this
is
done
with a specialized device|67995009|303607000|67995009|49062001|303607000|49062001

Chemical peels|240996002
are
chemicals|441900009
which
destroy
the epidermis|55988001
in a controlled manner,|31509003
leading|236874000
to exfoliation|271767006
and
the alleviation
of certain skin conditions,|17162000|95320005
including|55919000
superficial acne scars.|26283006|247459000

Various chemicals|256220008|441900009
can
be
used|394850002
depending
upon the depth|131197000
of the peel,|257890000|51979000
and
caution
should
be
used|394850002
,
particularly
for dark-skinned individuals|255419005|39937001|125676002|255419005|39937001|385435006

the removal|118292001|128303001
of the surface|410678000
of the skin|119325001|39937001|181469002
with special equipment,|67995009|246137000

YAG,
or
the 1540 nm Er:Glass|32039001

keloids.|33659008

This therapy|276239002
smooths|82280004
the epidermis|55988001
via contact cooling.|11723008|70862002

Multiple sessions|260396001
are
usually
required

their use,|277889008|419385000
but
the only randomized clinical trial|50607009|110465008|420295001|110465008
found|404684003
no statistically significant difference|386134007|263735002
in wound healing.|298005009

Care providers commonly
report|229059009|223458004
improvements,
however,
and
pressure therapy|279046003|276239002|13543005|276239002|257893003|276239002
has
been
effective|255403003|254648000
in treating ear keloids.|28995006|117590005|33659008|28995006|1910005|33659008

The general acceptance|60132005
of the treatment|276239002|416118004
as effective|255403003|254648000
may
prevent
it
from
being
further|46053002
studied|110465008|224699009
in clinical trials.[40]|110465008|259031006

Under medical supervision,|74188005|225313009|74188005|119270007
a long-term course|288524001
of corticosteroid injections|79440004|28289002|79440004|129326001
into the scar|70582006|275322007
may
help
flatten
and
soften|35828005
the appearance|386548000|255412001
of keloid|33659008
or
hypertrophic scars.[41]|19843006

The steroid|116566001
is
injected|422145002
into the scar|70582006|275322007
itself
;
since very little|260358002|281411007|260358002|255507004
is
absorbed
into the blood stream,|87612001|257709004|119273009|257709004
side effects
of this treatment|276239002|416118004
are
minor.|410599005|255606000

However,
it
does
cause thinning|134198009|29143009
of the scar tissue|70582006|275322007
so
it
does
carry|288345009
risks|30207005
when
injected|422145002
into scars|70582006|275322007
caused|23981006|134198009
by operations|83578000
into ruptured tendons.|415749005

This treatment|276239002|416118004
is
repeated|27582007
at four-|421534005
to six-week intervals.|422218008|258705008|385673002|422218008|259038000|385673002

Topical steroids|116566001|359540000|116566001
are
ineffective.[42]

Scar revision|284079008
is
a process|415178003
of cutting|70302008|410717008
the scar tissue out.|70582006|275322007

After the excision,|118292001|128303001
the new wound|7147002|13924000
is
usually
closed|29179001
up to heal|298005009
by primary intention,|63161005|367565008|63161005|361269008|261424001|367565008|261424001|361269008
instead of secondary intention.|2603003|367565008|2603003|361269008|81170007|367565008|81170007|361269008

Deeper cuts|131197000|283396008
need|410525008|103325001
a multilayered closure|112695004
to heal optimally,|298005009
otherwise
depressed|366979004
or
dented scars|70582006|275322007
can
result.[43]|394617004

Surgical excision|128303001
of hypertrophic|56246009
or
keloid scars|33659008
is
often|70232002
associated|47429007
to other methods,|272394005
such as pressotherapy
or
silicone gel sheeting.|13652007|385100002

Lone excision|118292001|128303001
of keloid scars,|33659008
however,
shows
a recurrence rate|246455001
close|29179001
to 45%.

A clinical study|58147004|110465008|58147004|224699009
is
currently|15240007
ongoing|255238004
to
assess
the benefits
of a treatment combining surgery|276239002|89780004|83578000|276239002|20909006|83578000|416118004|89780004|83578000|416118004|20909006|83578000
and
laser-assisted healing|122456005|371152001|298005009|122456005|371152001|90910008|38586004|371152001|298005009|38586004|371152001|90910008
in hypertrophic|56246009
or
keloid scars.|33659008

Research
shows
the use|277889008|419385000
of vitamin E|37237003
and
onion extract|256323007|62972009|80397000|62972009
(sold
as Mederma
as treatments|276239002
for scars|70582006|275322007
is
ineffective.

Vitamin E causes contact dermatitis|37237003|134198009|40275004
in
up to 33%|264667004
of users
and
in some cases|398241000|413769002
it
may
worsen|230993007|390772001
scar|70582006|275322007
appearance.|386548000|255412001

But
Vitamin C|46123006
and
some
of its esters|45120003
fade
the dark pigment|255419005|65863008
associated|47429007
with some scars.[44]|70582006|275322007

The permanence|272119005
of scarring|275322007
has
led|88488004|236874000
to its intentional use|361269008|277889008|361269008|419385000
as a form|246176004
of body art|279495008|123037004
within some
cultures|252398009|61594008
and
subcultures .|12387006

These forms|246176004
of ritual|67431008|262108006
and
non-ritual scarring practices|67431008|67431008|275322007|262108006|262108006|275322007
can
be
found|404684003
in many groups|261586004|160481000
and
cultures|252398009|61594008
around the world.

An intradermal injection|36673005
of transforming growth factor beta 3 (TGF ? 3)|81286007|52095000|81286007|260989008
is
being
tested.|272393004

The results|394617004
of three trials already|421291004|110465008
completed|255594003
were
published
in the _Lancet_|350810002
along
with an editorial commentary.[45]

A study|110465008|224699009
implicated
the protein ribosomal s6 kinase (RSK)|25644008|26761006
in the formation|11798007|255277001
of scar tissue|70582006|275322007
and
found|404684003
the introduction|107733003
of a chemical to|441900009
counteract
RSK|26761006|304257007
could
halt
the formation|11798007|255277001
of cirrhosis.|19943007

This treatment also|276239002|416118004
has
the potential to|30207005
reduce|260400001
or
even
prevent
altogether other types|261664005
of scarring.[46]|275322007

Research
has
also implicated osteopontin|102673007
in scarring.[47][48]|275322007

A research group|261586004|160481000|389109008
in South Africa|223549008
has
a combination approach|89780004
using|260676000
a microporous tape
in addition|260364009
to _Bulbine frutescens_
for hydration|405006006
and
_Centella asiatica_
for collagen conversion.|61472002|272148004

A small study|255507004|110465008|255507004|224699009
has
shown
an improved appearance|385425000|386548000|385425000|255412001|3442003|386548000|3442003|255412001
