is
a set
of inflammatory diseases|128139000
affecting|247591002|248448006
the periodontium,|245775004|8711009
i.e.,|42146005|22971001
the tissues|85756007
that surround|355648006
and
support|9096001|243114000
the teeth.|38199008

Periodontitis|41565005
involves|248448006
progressive loss|255314001
of the alveolar bone|272673000|3138006|90780006|128530007
around the teeth,|38199008
and
if left untreated,|7771000|25265005
can
lead|88488004
to the loosening|51121001
and
subsequent loss|255260001
of teeth.|38199008

Periodontitis|41565005
is
caused|23981006|134198009
by microorganisms|264395009
that
adhere|102491009
to
and
grow
on the tooth's surfaces,|245643006
along
with an overly aggressive immune response|61372001|35024006|35024006
against these microorganisms.|264395009

A diagnosis|439401001
of periodontitis|41565005
is
established|263748003|385645004
by inspecting
the soft gum tissues|181607009|113279002
around the teeth|38199008
with a probe|7402007
(i.e.,|42146005|22971001
a clinical examination|5880005
)
and
by evaluating
the patient's X-ray films|116154003|116154003|52250000|116154003|168537006|116154003|363680008
(i.e.|42146005|22971001

a radiographic examination|258106000|5880005
)
,
to
determine
the amount|107651007
of bone loss|312894000
around the teeth.|38199008

Specialists|309395003
in the treatment|276239002|416118004
of periodontitis|41565005
are
periodontists|37154003
;
their field|255798002
is
known|36692007
as "periodontology"|408461007
or
"periodontics".|408461007

The word "periodontitis"|255373000|41565005
comes
from the Greek _peri_,|1451003|272114000
"
around",
_odous_
(genitive _odontos_
)
,
"tooth",|38199008|302214001
and
the suffix -_itis_,
in medical terminology "inflammation".|74188005|257552002

The 1999 classification system|73504009
for periodontal diseases|2556008
and
conditions|260905004
listed
seven major categories|420359007|255603008
of periodontal diseases,|2556008
[2]|260306008
of which
the last six|422218008
are
termed
_destructive_ periodontal disease|255303004|2556008
because
the damage|37782003
is
essentially irreversible.

The seven categories|420359007
are
as
follows|367409002
:

Moreover,
terminology
expressing
both
the extent|255590007
and
severity|272141005
of periodontal diseases|2556008
are
appended
to the terms above to
denote
the specific diagnosis|69658003|439401001|69658003
of a particular patient|116154003
or
group|261586004|160481000|389109008
of patients.|116154003

The 'extent'|255590007
of disease refers|64572001|439980006
to the proportion|8212001
of the dentition|245543004|38199008
affected|247591002|248448006
by the disease|64572001
in terms
of percentage|118582008
of sites.|10546003

Sites|10546003
are
defined
as the positions|246449006
at which probing measurements|387651008|272391002
are
taken|419652001
around each tooth|38199008|302214001
and
,
generally,
six probing sites|422218008|246274007
around each tooth|38199008|302214001
are
recorded
,
as
follows|367409002
:

If
up to 30%
of sites|10546003
in the mouth|74262004|123851003|21082005|181220002
are
affected|247591002|248448006
,
the manifestation|250255003|251190009
is
classification|73504009
as 'localized'|255471002
;
for more
than 30%,
the term 'generalized'|60132005
is
used.|394850002

The 'severity'|272141005
of disease refers|64572001|439980006
to the amount|107651007
of periodontal ligament fibers|245775004|400293002|245775004|37202001
that
have
been
lost
,
termed 'clinical attachment loss'.|58147004|1431002

According to the American Academy of Periodontology,|408461007
the classification|73504009
of severity|272141005
is
as
follows|367409002
:
[3]|260313008

In the early stages,|264499004|261612004
periodontitis|41565005
has
very few symptoms|260358002
;
and
in many individuals|125676002|385435006
the disease|64572001
has
progressed|385651009
significantly
before
they
seek
treatment.|276239002|416118004

Symptoms
may
include|55919000
:

Patients|116154003
should
realize
gingival inflammation|113279002|257552002|372457001|257552002
and
bone destruction|272673000|64597002|3138006|64597002|90780006|64597002|128530007|64597002
are
largely painless.|255350008

Hence,
people|125676002
may
wrongly
assume
painless|255350008
bleeding|131148009
after teeth cleaning|38199008|228402009
is
insignificant,
although
this
may
be
a symptom
of progressing periodontitis|255314001|41565005
in
that patient.|116154003

Periodontitis|41565005
has
been
linked
to increased inflammation|35105006|257552002|260366006|257552002
in the body,|279495008|123037004
such as
indicated|410535002
by raised levels|260399008|258395000
of C-reactive protein|61425002|55235003
and
interleukin-6.|30965005|22766004

It
is
linked
through this to increased risk|35105006|30207005|260366006|30207005
of stroke,|230690007
[8][9] myocardial infarction,|22298006
[10]
and
atherosclerosis.|38716007

It also
linked
in those over 60 years|21481007|258707000
of age|424144002
to impairments|40226000
in delayed memory|303116000|106136008
and
calculation abilities.|371150009

Individuals|125676002|385435006
with impaired fasting glucose|390951007
and
diabetes mellitus|73211009
have
higher degrees|75540009|246173007|371879000|246173007
of periodontal inflammation,|245775004|257552002|8711009|257552002
and
often|70232002
have
difficulties|371157007
with balancing|249982003|282298003
their blood glucose level|365812005
owing to the constant systemic inflammatory state,|31099001|398070004
caused|23981006|134198009
by the periodontal inflammation.|245775004|257552002|8711009|257552002

Although
no causative connection|263538003
was
proved|277025001
yet,
a recent study|6493001|110465008|6493001|224699009
revealed|263857004
an epidemiological association|263534001|272151006
between chronic periodontitis|5689008
and
erectile dysfunction.[22]|397803000

Periodontitis|41565005
is
an inflammation|257552002
of the periodontium,|245775004|8711009
i.e.,|42146005|22971001
the tissues|85756007
that
support|9096001|243114000
the teeth.|38199008

The periodontium|245775004|8711009
consists
of four tissues|421534005|85756007
:

The primary etiology|63161005|134198009|261424001|134198009
(cause|134198009
)
of gingivitis|66383009
is
poor oral hygiene|110299009
which
leads|88488004|236874000
to the accumulation
of a mycotic[23][24][25][26]|3218000|264657009
and
bacterial matrix|409822003
at the gum line,|113279002|50009006
called
dental plaque.|4522001

Other contributors|74964007
are
poor nutrition|248325000
and
underlying medical issues|74188005|55607006
such as diabetes.|73211009

New finger nick tests|7147002|7569003|269814003|7147002|7569003|272393004|7147002|302541005|269814003|7147002|302541005|272393004
have
been
approved|9571008
by the Food and Drug Administration|255620007|18629005
in the
US,
and
are
being
used|394850002
in dental offices to|257649000
identify|7882003
and
screen patients|20135006|116154003|116154003|360156006|116154003
for possible contributory causes|371930009|134198009|60022001|134198009
of gum disease,|18718003|2556008
such as diabetes.|73211009

In some people,|125676002
gingivitis progresses|66383009|385651009
to periodontitis ?-|41565005
with the destruction|64597002
of the gingival fibers,|113279002|400293002|113279002|37202001|372457001|400293002|372457001|37202001
the gum tissues|113279002|85756007
separate|263869007
from the tooth|38199008|302214001
and
deepened sulcus,
called
a periodontal pocket.|109629007

Subgingival micro-organisms|419601003|264395009
(
those that
exist
under the gum line|113279002|50009006
)
colonize
the periodontal pockets|109629007
and
cause|23981006|134198009
further inflammation|46053002|257552002
in the gum tissues|113279002|85756007
and
progressive bone loss.|255314001|312894000

Examples
of secondary etiology|2603003|134198009|81170007|134198009
are
those things
that,
by definition,
cause|23981006|134198009
microbic plaque accumulation,|4522001|1522000|38551001
such as restoration overhangs|260938008
and
root proximity.|85077000|2338009

Smoking|365981007
is
another factor
that
increases|260366006
the occurrence|272120004
of periodontitis,|41565005
directly
or
indirectly,
[28][29][30]
and
may
interfere|78235001
with
or
adversely
affect|4065008
its treatment.[31][32][33]|276239002|264664006|264667004|416118004|264664006|264667004

Ehlers?Danlos syndrome|398114001
is
a periodontitis risk factor.|41565005|80943009

If
left undisturbed,|7771000
microbial plaque|4522001|1522000|38551001
calcifies
to
form|246176004
calculus,|384600008
which
is
commonly called tartar.|17552000

Calculus|384600008
above
and
below the gum line|113279002|50009006
must
be
removed|127485006
completely
by the dental hygienist|26042002
or
dentist to|106289002|82603007
treat|395077000
gingivitis|66383009
and
periodontitis.|41565005

Although
the primary cause|63161005|23981006|63161005|134198009|261424001|23981006|261424001|134198009
of
both
gingivitis|66383009
and
periodontitis|41565005
is
the microbial plaque|4522001|1522000|38551001
that
adheres|102491009
to the tooth surfaces,|245643006
there
are
many other modifying factors.|260396001|260396001|243326001

A very strong risk factor|260358002|260404005|80943009
is
one's genetic susceptibility.|421379005|47708004

Several conditions|261028005|260905004
and
diseases,|64572001
including|55919000
Down syndrome,|41040004
diabetes,|73211009
and
other diseases|74964007|64572001
that
affect|4065008
one's resistance|421379005|30714006
to infection,
also
increase|260366006
susceptibility|76522002|118588007
to periodontitis.|41565005

Another factor
that
makes
periodontitis|41565005
a difficult disease to|52925006|64572001
study|110465008|224699009
is
that human host response|278412004|35024006
can
also
affect|4065008
the alveolar bone resorption.|109706009|272673000|109706009|3138006|109706009|90780006|109706009|128530007|22200009

Host response|35024006
to the bacterial-mycotic insult|409822003|3218000
is
mainly
determined
by genetics
;
however,
immune development|255386009|278923009
may
play|300776002
some role
in susceptibility.|76522002|118588007

According to some researchers periodontitis|41565005
may
be
associated|47429007
with higher stress.[34]|75540009|262188008|371879000|262188008

Daily oral hygiene|69620002|364126007
measures|246445000|367346004
to
prevent
periodontal disease|2556008
include|55919000
:

Typically,
dental hygienists|26042002
(
or
dentists|106289002
)
use|277889008|419385000
special instruments to|67995009|57134006
clean|228402009
(debride
)
teeth|38199008
below the gumline
and
disrupt
any plaque|4522001|1522000|38551001
growing
below the gumline.

This
is
a standard treatment to|276239002|416118004
prevent
any further progress|46053002|385651009
of established periodontitis.|263748003|41565005|385645004|41565005

Studies|110465008|224699009
show
that
after
such a professional cleaning|228402009
(periodontal debridement|245775004|36777000|8711009|36777000
)
,
microbial plaque|4522001|1522000|38551001
tends
to
grow
back
to precleaning levels|258395000
after
about three|421291004
to four months.|421534005|258706009

Nonetheless,
the continued stabilization|255238004|115979005
of a patient's periodontal state|116154003|245775004|398070004|116154003|8711009|398070004
depends
largely,
if
not primarily,
on the patient's oral hygiene|116154003|364126007
at home,|261770009
as well as
on the
go.

Without daily oral hygiene,|69620002|364126007
periodontal disease|2556008
will
not
be
overcome, especially
if
the patient|116154003
has
a history|392521001
of extensive periodontal disease.|41118005|2556008

Periodontal disease|2556008
and
tooth loss|25540007
are
associated|47429007
with an increased risk|35105006|30207005|260366006|30207005
of cancer.[35]|363346000|372087000

Contributing causes|134198009
may
be
high alcohol consumption|75540009|160573003|371879000|160573003
or
a diet|41829006
low|62482003|371880002
in antioxidants.[36]

The cornerstone
of successful periodontal treatment|182985004|245775004|182985004|8711009
starts|255395001|385652002
with establishing excellent oral hygiene.|263748003|425405005|364126007

This
includes|55919000
twice-daily brushing|229799001|263693004
with daily flossing.|69620002

Also,
the use|277889008|419385000
of an interdental brush|260240005|994005
is
helpful
if space
between the teeth|38199008
allows.

For smaller spaces,|263796003|255507004
a product
called
"Soft Picks"|37378003
is
an excellent manual cleaning device.|425405005|87982008|228402009|303607000|425405005|87982008|228402009|49062001

Persons|125676002
with dexterity problems,|288361006|55607006
such as arthritis,|3723001
may
find
oral hygiene to|364126007
be
difficult|52925006
and
may
require
more frequent professional care|242762006|70232002
and/or
the use|277889008|419385000
of a powered tooth brush.|20235003

Persons|125676002
with periodontitis|41565005
must
realize
it
is
a chronic inflammatory disease|128294001
and
a lifelong regimen
of excellent hygiene|425405005|284779002
and
professional maintenance care
with a dentist/hygienist|106289002|82603007
or
periodontist|37154003
is
required to
maintain|385630006
affected teeth.|247591002|38199008|248448006|38199008

Removal|118292001|128303001
of microbial plaque|4522001|1522000|38551001
and
calculus|384600008
is
necessary to
establish|263748003
periodontal health.|245775004|263775005|8711009|263775005

The first step in|255216001|398298007|232714002|398298007
the treatment|276239002|416118004
of periodontitis|41565005
involves|248448006
nonsurgical cleaning|228402009
below the gumline
with a procedure|71388002
called
scaling|271767006
and
debridement.|36777000

In the past,|410513005
root planing|234699004
was
used|394850002
(removal|118292001|128303001
of cemental layer|80541002
as well as
calculus|384600008
).

This procedure|71388002
involves|248448006
use|277889008|419385000
of specialized curettes|67995009|272206003|272206003
to mechanically
remove|127485006
plaque|4522001|1522000|38551001
and
calculus|384600008
from
below the gumline,
and
may
require
multiple visits|260396001
and
local anesthesia|386761002
to adequately
complete.|255594003

In addition|260364009
to initial scaling|884001|271767006|232714002|271767006
and
root planing,|234699004
it
may
also
be
necessary to
adjust|410617001
the occlusion|25272006|26036001|257885003|263823007
(bite|3404009|25272006
)
to
prevent
excessive force|260378005|260378005|285653008
on teeth|38199008
that
have
reduced bone support.|260400001|272673000|9096001|260400001|272673000|243114000|260400001|3138006|9096001|260400001|3138006|243114000|260400001|90780006|9096001|260400001|90780006|243114000|260400001|128530007|9096001|260400001|128530007|243114000

Also,
it
may
be
necessary to
complete|255594003
any other dental needs,|74964007|410525008|74964007|103325001
such as replacement|3137001|282089006
of rough, plaque-retentive restorations,|4522001|260938008|1522000|260938008|38551001|260938008
closure|112695004
of open contacts|56116003|11723008|56116003|70862002
between teeth,|38199008
and
any other requirements|74964007
diagnosed|439401001
at the initial evaluation.|884001|884001|386053000|232714002|232714002|386053000

Multiple clinical studies|260396001|58147004|110465008|260396001|58147004|224699009
have
shown
nonsurgical scaling|271767006
and
root planing|234699004
are
usually successful|385669000
if
the periodontal pockets|109629007
are
shallower
than 4?5 mm|264676006
(0.16?0.20
in
).

The dentist|106289002|82603007
or
hygienist
must
perform|398166005
a re-evaluation four|228877007|421534005|228877007|386053000|421534005
to six weeks|422218008|258705008
after the initial scaling|884001|271767006|232714002|271767006
and
root planing,|234699004
to
determine
if
the patient's oral hygiene|116154003|364126007
has
improved|385425000|3442003
and
inflammation|257552002
has
regressed.

Probing|387651008
should
be
avoided
then,
and
an analysis|272389005
by gingival index|113279002|419205000|372457001|419205000
should
determine
the presence|386397008
or
absence|2667000|418560003
of inflammation.|257552002

The monthly reevaluation|89185003
of periodontal therapy|245775004|276239002|8711009|276239002
should
involve|248448006
periodontal charting|245775004|8711009
as a better indication|3442003|410666004
of the success|385669000
of treatment,|276239002|416118004
and
to
see|281004000
if other courses|74964007|288524001
of treatment|276239002|416118004
can
be
identified.|7882003

Pocket depths|131197000
of greater|263768009
than 5?6 mm|260271001
(0.20?0.24
in
)
which
remain
after initial therapy,|884001|276239002|232714002|276239002
with bleeding|131148009
upon probing,|387651008
indicate|410535002
continued active disease|255238004|55561003|64572001
and
will
very likely|260358002|2931005
lead|88488004
to further bone loss|46053002|312894000
over time.|410669006

This
is
especially true|31874001
in molar tooth sites|421456005|10546003
where furcations
(areas|42798000
between the roots|2338009
)
have
been
exposed.|24932003

If nonsurgical therapy|276239002
is
found to|404684003
have
been
unsuccessful|385671000
in managing signs|119270007|72670004
of disease activity,|64572001|48761009|64572001|55561003|64572001|258745004|64572001|257733005
periodontal surgery|234677007
may
be
needed|410525008|103325001
to
stop|422117008
progressive bone loss|255314001|312894000
and
regenerate lost bone|272673000|3138006|90780006|128530007
where possible.|371930009|60022001

Many surgical approaches|424876005
are
used|394850002
in treatment|52101004|276239002|52101004|416118004|18720000|276239002|18720000|416118004
of advanced periodontitis,|86005002|41565005
including|55919000
open flap debridement|56116003|256683004|36777000
and
osseous surgery,|272673000|83578000|3138006|83578000
as well as
guided tissue regeneration|106384005|85756007|34636005|106384005|85756007|278313005|303479009|85756007|34636005|303479009|85756007|278313005
and
bone grafting.|80983001

The goal|410518001
of periodontal surgery|234677007
is
access|260507000
for definitive calculus removal|261002007|384600008|118292001|261002007|384600008|128303001
and
surgical management|83578000|413454004|83578000|119270007
of bony irregularities|263686003|49608001
which
have
resulted|42752001|394617004
from the disease process to|64572001|415178003
reduce|260400001
pockets
as
much
as possible.|371930009|60022001

Long-term studies|110465008|224699009
have
shown
,
in moderate|6736007
to advanced periodontitis,|86005002|41565005
surgically treated cases often|83578000|28995006|398241000|70232002|83578000|28995006|413769002|70232002
have
less further breakdown|276139006|46053002|40091007|276139006|46053002|125366008|263796003|46053002|40091007|263796003|46053002|125366008
over time|410669006
and
,
when
coupled
with a regular post-treatment maintenance regimen,|17854005|288563008|276239002|17854005|288563008|416118004
are
successful|385669000
in nearly
halting
tooth loss|25540007
in nearly 85%
of patients.[40][41]|116154003|259031006

Once successful periodontal treatment|182985004|245775004|182985004|8711009
has
been
completed|255594003
,
with
or
without surgery,|83578000
an ongoing regimen|255238004
of "periodontal maintenance"|245775004|8711009
is
required.

This
involves|248448006
regular checkups|17854005
and
detailed cleanings
every three months to|421291004|258706009
prevent
repopulation
of periodontitis-causing microorganism,|41565005|23981006|264395009
and
to closely
monitor|13288007
affected teeth|247591002|38199008|248448006|38199008
so
early treatment|264499004|276239002|264499004|416118004
can
be
rendered
if disease recurs.|64572001|246455001

Usually,
periodontal disease|2556008
exists
due to poor plaque control,|11403006|4522001|31509003|11403006|1522000|31509003|11403006|38551001|31509003|255351007|4522001|31509003|255351007|1522000|31509003|255351007|38551001|31509003
therefore
if
the brushing techniques|263693004|272394005
are
not
modified|243326001
,
a periodontal recurrence|245775004|246455001|8711009|246455001
is
probable.|2931005

Periodontitis|41565005
has
an inescapable relationship|272151006
with subgingival calculus|419601003|384600008
(tartar|17552000
).

The first step in|255216001|398298007|232714002|398298007
any procedure|71388002
is
to
eliminate
calculus|384600008
under the gum line,|113279002|50009006
as
it
houses|261770009
destructive anaerobic microorganisms|255303004|264395009
that
consume
bone,|272673000|3138006|90780006|128530007
gum|113279002
and
cementum|80541002
(connective tissue|181769001
)
for food.|255620007

Most alternative ?
at-home? gum disease treatments|261770009|18718003|276239002|261770009|2556008|276239002
involve|248448006
injecting|422145002
antimicrobial solutions,|250428009|8537005
such as hydrogen peroxide,|387171003
into periodontal pockets|109629007
via slender applicators|408101000
or
oral irrigators.|260548002|89747006

This process|415178003
disrupts
anaerobic micro-organism colonies|264395009|258736000
and
is
effective|255403003|254648000
at reducing infections|260400001
and
inflammation|257552002
when
used|394850002
daily.|69620002

A number|410680006|410681005
of other products,|74964007
functionally equivalent|9726003|258726008
to hydrogen peroxide,|387171003
are
commercially available,|103328004
but
at substantially higher cost.|75540009|371879000

However,
such treatments|276239002
do
not
address|397635003
calculus formations,|384600008|255277001
and
so|223528007
are
short-lived,|359530003|224130005|359530003|419749002|367450005|224130005|367450005|419749002
as
anaerobic microbial colonies quickly|258736000
regenerate
in
and
around calculus.|384600008

Additionally,
periodontitis|41565005
can
be
treated|28995006
in a noninvasive manner|22762002
by means of Periostat,
an FDA-approved, orally administered drug|9571008|260548002|418283001|410942007
that
has
been
shown
to
reduce|260400001
bone loss.|312894000

Its mechanism|257544000
of action|129264002
in part|260726005
involves|248448006
inhibition|61511001|419495008
of matrix metalloproteinases|130355006
(
such as collagenase|417416003
)
,
which
degrade
the extracellular matrix|69320009
under inflammatory conditions.|260905004

This ultimately
can
lead|88488004
to reduction|58294000|260400001|289928003
of aveolar bone loss|312894000
in patients|116154003
with periodontal disease|2556008
(
as well as
patients|116154003
without periodontitis|41565005
).

Dentists|106289002
and
dental hygienists|26042002
measure|246445000|272391002
periodontal disease|2556008
using|260676000
a device|303607000|49062001
called
a periodontal probe.|245775004|7402007|8711009|7402007

This thin "measuring|18043004|258104002|18043004|263571004
stick
"
is
gently|418449005
placed|257557008|421066005
into the space
between the gums|113279002
and
the teeth,|38199008
and
slipped|54670004
below the gumline.

If
the probe|7402007
can
slip|54670004
more
than 3 mm|260313008
(0.12
in
)
below the gumline,
the patient|116154003
is
said to|66049007
have
a gingival pocket|109628004
if
no migration|74118003
of the epithelial attachment|1431002
has
occurred|272120004
or
a periodontal pocket|109629007
if
apical migration|43674008|74118003
has
occurred.|272120004

This
is
somewhat
of a misnomer,
as
any depth|131197000
is
in essence|35079003
a pocket,
which in turn|282987006
is
defined
by its depth,|131197000
i.e.,|42146005|22971001
a 2-mm pocket|260306008
or
a 6-mm pocket.

However,
pockets
are
generally
accepted|385645004
as
self-cleansable
(
at home,|261770009
by the patient,|116154003
with a toothbrush|20235003
)
if
they
are
3 mm|260313008
or
less
in depth.|131197000

This
is
important because
if
a a pocket
is
deeper|131197000
than 3 mm|260313008
around the tooth,|38199008|302214001
at-home care|60689008
will
not
be
sufficient to|51117008
cleanse
the pocket,
and
professional care
should
be
sought.

When
the pocket depths|131197000
reach|282679008
6
to 7 mm
(0.24
to 0.28
in
)
in depth,|131197000
the hand instruments|85562004|57134006|302539009|57134006
and
cavitrons
used|394850002
by the dental professionals
may
not
reach|282679008
deeply
enough
into the pocket to
clean|228402009
out
the microbial plaque|4522001|1522000|38551001
that
cause|23981006|134198009
gingival inflammation.|113279002|257552002|372457001|257552002

In such
a situation,
the bone|272673000|3138006|90780006|128530007
or
the gums|113279002
around
that tooth|38199008|302214001
should
be
surgically|83578000
altered
or
it
will
always
have
inflammation|257552002
which
will
likely|2931005
result|394617004
in more bone loss|242762006|312894000
around
that tooth.|38199008|302214001

An additional way to|260364009
stop|422117008
the inflammation|257552002
would
be
for the patient to|116154003
receive
subgingival antibiotics|419601003|255631004
(
such as minocycline|372653009
or
undergo
some form|246176004
of gingival surgery to|113279002|83578000|372457001|83578000
access|260507000
the depths|131197000
of the pockets
and
perhaps even
change|243326001|263703002
the pocket depths|131197000
so
they
become
3 mm|260313008
or
less
in depth|131197000
and
can
once
again
be
properly
cleaned|228402009
by the patient|116154003
at home|261770009
with his
or
her toothbrush.|20235003

If patients|116154003
have
7-mm
or
deeper pockets|131197000
around their teeth,|38199008
then
they
would
likely|2931005
risk|30207005
eventual tooth loss|25540007
over the years.|258707000

If
this periodontal condition|245775004|260905004|8711009|260905004
is
not
identified|7882003
and
the patients|116154003
remain
unaware|418107008|406124004
of the progressive nature|255314001|277302009
of the disease,|64572001
then years later,|258707000
they
may
be
surprised
that
some teeth|38199008
will
gradually
become
loose|78799005
and
may
need|410525008|103325001
to
be
extracted|62972009
,
sometimes
due to a severe infection|24484000
or
even pain.|22253000

According to the Sri Lankan tea labourer study,|16313001|106540006|110465008|16313001|106540006|224699009
in the absence|2667000|418560003
of any oral hygiene activity,|364126007|48761009|364126007|55561003|364126007|258745004|364126007|257733005
approximately 10%|26175008
will
suffer
from severe periodontal disease|24484000|2556008
with rapid loss|255358001
of attachment|1431002
(
>2 mm/year|260306008|258707000|260306008|259039008
).

About 80%
will
suffer
from moderate loss|6736007
(1?2 mm/year|303183002|258707000|303183002|259039008
)
and
the remaining 10%
will
not
suffer
any loss.[42][43]

Periodontitis|41565005
is
very common,|260358002|72906007
and
is
widely
regarded
as the second most common disease worldwide,|48873002|72906007
after
dental decay,|80967001
and
in the United States|223688001
has
a prevalence
of 30?50%
of the population,|385436007|389109008
but
only about 10%|50607009|420295001
have
severe forms.|24484000|246176004

Like other conditions intimately|74964007|260905004
related|272151006|262094002
to
access|260507000
to hygiene|284779002
and
basic medical monitoring|74188005|302805002|418836005|74188005|302805002
and
care,
periodontitis|41565005
tends
to
be
more common|242762006|72906007
in economically disadvantaged populations|385436007
or
regions.|410673009

Its occurrence|272120004
decreases|260370003
with higher standard|75540009|371879000
of living.

In Israeli population,|385436007|389109008
individuals|125676002|385435006
of Yemenite,
North-African,|413464008
South Asian,|414978006
or
Mediterranean origin|255395001
have
higher prevalence|75540009|371879000
of periodontal disease|2556008
than individuals|125676002|385435006
from European descent.[45]|414152003

Periodontal disease|2556008
is
the most common disease|4757001|72906007|64572001
found|404684003
in dogs|448771007
and
affects|4065008
more
than 80%
of dogs|448771007
aged|424144002|105436006
three years|421291004|258707000
or
older.|70753007

Its prevalence
in dogs|448771007
increases|260366006
with age,|424144002
but
decreases|260370003
with increasing body weight|262286000|279495008|262286000|123037004|260369004|27113001|260369004|39857003
;
i.e.,|42146005|22971001
toy|91032009
and
miniature breeds
are
more severely|242762006|24484000
affected.|247591002|248448006

Systemic disease|264578000
may
develop
because
the gums|113279002
are
very vascular|260358002|59820001
(
have
a good blood supply|20572008|87612001|425398004|20572008|119273009|425398004
).

The blood stream|87612001|257709004|119273009|257709004
carries|288345009
these anaerobic micro-organisms,|264395009
and
they
are
filtered|116250002|258648006
out
by the kidneys|64033007|17373004
and
liver,|10200004|181268008
where
they
may
colonize
and
create
microabscesses.|48033007

The micro-organisms traveling|264395009|420008001
through the blood|87612001|119273009
may
also
attach|102491009
to the heart valves,|17401000
causing|23981006
vegetative endocarditis|86100009
(infected heart valves|17401000
).

Additional diseases|260364009|64572001
that
may
result|394617004
from periodontitis|41565005
include|55919000
chronic bronchitis|63480004
and
pulmonary fibrosis.[46]|51615001
