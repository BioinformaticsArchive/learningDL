is
a small|255507004
(1-2mm|260305007
)
red|386713009|371240000
or
purple spot|264374004|23840004
on the body,|279495008|123037004
caused|23981006|134198009
by a minor hemorrhage|410599005|131148009|255606000|131148009
(broken capillary blood vessels.[1]|248706000|20982000|248706000|255416003

"Petechiae" refers|423716004|439980006
to one|421379005
of the three major classes|421291004|255603008|258391009
of purpuric skin conditions.|95320005

Purpuric eruptions|1806006
are
classified|73504009
by size|277049003
into three broad categories.|421291004|90522003

Petechiae|423716004
is
generally
used|394850002
to
refer|439980006
to the smallest|263796003|255507004
of the three classes|421291004|258391009
of purpuric skin eruptions,|271807003
those
that
measure|246445000|272391002
less
than 3 mm.|260313008

The most common cause|4757001|72906007|134198009
of petechiae|423716004
is
through physical trauma|5880005|5880005|19388002|19388002
such as a hard bout|72505002
of coughing,|272039006
vomiting|249497008
or
crying,|28263002
which
can
result|394617004
in facial petechiae,|89545001|423716004
especially
around the eyes.|81745001

Petechiae|423716004
in this instance
are
harmless
and
usually
disappear
within a few days.|57176003|258703001

Petechiae|423716004
may
be
a sign|72670004
of thrombocytopenia|415116008
(low platelet counts
)
when
platelet function|417313007
is
inhibited|61511001
(
e.g.
,
as
a side effect
of medications|410942007
or
during certain infections|17162000
)
,
or
in clotting factor deficiencies.|350475008|260372006|350475008|248325000

They
may
also
occur|272120004
when
excessive pressure|260378005|279046003|260378005|13543005|260378005|257893003
is
applied|410618006
to tissue|85756007
(
e.g.
,
when
a tourniquet|38141007
is
applied|410618006
to an extremity|66019005
or
with excessive coughing|260378005|272039006
or
vomiting|249497008
).

If unsure,|64957009
petechiae|423716004
should
always
be
quickly
investigated.|116698004

They
can
be
interpreted|363714003
as vasculitis,|31996006
an inflammation|257552002
of the blood vessels,|59820001
which
requires
immediate treatment to|88694003|276239002|88694003|416118004|49499008|276239002|49499008|416118004
prevent
permanent damage.|6934004|37782003

Some malignancies|363346000
can
also
cause|23981006|134198009
petechiae to|423716004
appear.

Petechiae|423716004
should
be
investigated|116698004
by a doctor to|309343006
rule|10828004
out
the more dangerous conditions.|242762006|260905004

Dermatologists|18803008
can
be
the most helpful specialists|4757001|309395003
in these conditions|260905004
because
they
can
more easily|242762006|36203004
identify|7882003
if
the condition|260905004
is
petechiae|423716004
or
some similar looking|386548000
but
less worrisome rash.|276139006|271807003|263796003|271807003

The significance|386134007
of petechiae|423716004
in children|410601007|160499008
depends
on the clinical context|58147004|263491009
in which
they
arise.|68727004

Petechiae|423716004
in children|410601007|160499008
can
occur|272120004
with viral infections.|34014006

In this instance,
they
do
not necessarily
signify
a serious illness.|42745003|39104002

However,
they
are
a hallmark signal
of some potentially serious illnesses,|42745003|39104002
such as meningococcemia,|4089001
leukemia,|87163000
and
certain causes|17162000|134198009
of thrombocytopenia,|415116008
of which meningococcemia|4089001
can
cause|23981006|134198009
death|419620001|268923008
within 48 hours|255249005
of infection.

Therefore,
their presence|386397008
should
not
be
ignored.

Petechiae|423716004
(
in the face|89545001|302549007
)
may
also
be
present|52101004|246105001
in cases|398241000|413769002
of self asphyxiation.|66466001

Petechiae|423716004
on the soft palate|49460000|245784004
are
mainly
associated|47429007
with streptococcal pharyngitis,|43878008
[3]|260313008
and
as such
it
is
an uncommon|103356009
but
highly specific finding.|75540009|69658003|404684003|75540009|69658003

10
to 30 percent|118582008
of palatal petechiae cases|261145003|423716004|398241000|261145003|423716004|413769002
are
estimated|414135002
to
be
caused|23981006|134198009
by suction|274441001
such as
can
be
habitual|40451002
or
secondary|2603003|81170007
to fellatio.[5]|21312008

Facial petechiae,|89545001|423716004
especially
around the eyes,|81745001
indicate|410535002
physical trauma|5880005|5880005|19388002|19388002
such as
by hard bouts|72505002
of coughing,|272039006
vomiting|249497008
or
crying.|28263002

Petechiae|423716004
on the face|89545001|302549007
and
conjunctiva|29445007|181161008
(eyes|81745001
)
can
be
a sign|72670004
of a death|419620001|268923008
by asphyxiation.|66466001

Petechiae|423716004
are
thought|88952004
to
result|394617004
from an increase|260366006
of pressure|279046003|13543005|257893003
in the veins|29092000
of the head|69536005|302548004
and
hypoxic damage|389086002|37782003
to endothelia|27168002
of blood vessels.[6]|59820001

Petechiae|423716004
can
be
used|394850002
by police investigators
in determining
if strangulation|25318002|263884003
has
been
part|260726005
of an attack.|217315002|216299002

The documentation|23745001
of the presence|386397008
of petechiae|423716004
on a victim
can
help
police investigators
prove|277025001
the case.|398241000

Petechiae|423716004
resulting|42752001
from strangulation|25318002|263884003
can
be
relatively tiny
and
light|56242006|371268001
in color|263714004
to very bright|260358002|221668007
and
pronounced.

Petechiae|423716004
may
be
seen
on the face,|89545001|302549007
in the whites|413773004|185984009
of the eyes|81745001
or
on the inside of the eyelids.|260521003|80243003
