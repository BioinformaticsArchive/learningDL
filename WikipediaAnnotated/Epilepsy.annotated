*Epilepsy|313307000
*
*
(
from Ancient Greek ???????? _epil?psia_|1451003
)
is
a common|72906007
and
diverse set
of chronic neurological disorders|27624003|1199008|90734009|118940003
characterized
by seizures.|91175000

Some definitions
of epilepsy|313307000
require
that seizures|91175000
be
_recurrent_|255227004
and
_unprovoked_,
[1][2][3]|303183002
but
others|74964007
require
only
a single seizure|125681006|91175000|50607009|91175000
combined|89780004
with brain alterations|12738006|258335003
which
increase|260366006
the chance
of future seizures.|91175000

In many cases|398241000|413769002
a cause|134198009
cannot
be
identified|7882003
,
however factors
that
are
associated|47429007
include|55919000
brain trauma,|127295002
strokes,|230690007
brain cancer,|428061005
and
drug|410942007
and
alcohol misuse|419442005|53041004|430837008
among others.[5]|74964007

Epileptic seizures|313307000
result|394617004
from abnormal, excessive|263654008|260378005
or
hypersynchronous neuronal activity|47220008|48761009|47220008|55561003|47220008|258745004|47220008|257733005
in the brain.|12738006|258335003

About 50 million people worldwide|125676002
have
epilepsy,|313307000
and
nearly 90%|264705001|264703008
of epilepsy|313307000
occurs|272120004
in developing countries.|223369002

Epilepsy|313307000
becomes
more common|242762006|72906007
as people age.|125676002|424144002

Onset|77374008
of new cases|7147002|398241000|7147002|413769002
occurs|272120004
most frequently|70232002
in infants|418119000
and
the elderly.|105436006

As a consequence|103332005
of brain surgery,|70586009
epileptic seizures|313307000
may
occur|272120004
in recovering patients.|74822006|116154003

Epilepsy|313307000
is
usually
controlled|31509003
,
but
not
cured
,
with medication.|410942007

However,
over 30%|21481007
of people|125676002
with epilepsy|313307000
do
not
have
seizure control even|91175000|31509003
with the best available medications.|20572008|103328004|410942007|3442003|103328004|410942007

Surgery|83578000
may
be
considered
in difficult cases.|52925006|398241000|52925006|413769002

Not
all epilepsy syndromes|313307000
are
lifelong ?
some forms|246176004
are
confined
to particular stages|261612004
of childhood.|68433009

Epilepsy|313307000
should
not
be
understood|66216009
as a single disorder,|125681006|64572001|50607009|64572001
but
rather
as
syndromic
with vastly divergent symptoms,|263741009
all
involving|248448006
episodic abnormal electrical activity|278499009|263654008|22626006
in the brain|12738006|258335003
and
numerous seizures.|260396001|91175000

Epilepsy|313307000
is
characterized
by a long term risk|30207005
of recurrent seizures.|255227004|91175000

These seizures|91175000
may
present|52101004|246105001
in a number|410680006|410681005
of different ways.[11]|263735002

The diagnosis|439401001
of epilepsy usually|313307000
requires
that
the seizures|91175000
occur|272120004
spontaneously.

Nevertheless,
certain epilepsy syndromes|17162000|313307000
require
particular precipitants
or
triggers
for seizures to|91175000
occur.|272120004

These
are
termed
reflex epilepsy.|79745005

For example,
patients|116154003
with primary reading epilepsy|63161005|7689009|261424001|7689009
have
seizures|91175000
triggered|410658008
by reading_[citation|50360004
needed|410525008|103325001
_].

Photosensitive epilepsy|95208000
can
be
limited|255469002
to seizures|91175000
triggered|410658008
by flashing lights.|56170001

Other precipitants|74964007
can
trigger|410658008
an epileptic seizure|313307000
in patients|116154003
who otherwise
would
be
susceptible|131196009
to spontaneous seizures.|5054005|91175000

For example,
children|410601007|160499008
with childhood absence epilepsy|230413002
may
be
susceptible|131196009
to hyperventilation.|68978004

In fact,
flashing|248103001
lights|56242006
and
hyperventilation|68978004
are
activating procedures|71388002
used|394850002
in clinical EEG to|58147004|54550000
help
trigger seizures to|91175000|410658008|91175000
aid|246088000
diagnosis.|439401001

Finally,
other precipitants|74964007
can
facilitate
,
rather than
obligately
trigger|410658008
,
seizures|91175000
in susceptible individuals.|131196009|125676002|131196009|385435006

Emotional stress,|442347009
sleep deprivation,|130989002
sleep|258158006
itself,
heat stress,|88999006|262188008
alcohol|419442005|53041004|430837008
and
febrile illness|416113008
are
examples
of precipitants
cited
by patients|116154003
with epilepsy.|313307000

Notably,
the influence
of various precipitants|256220008
varies
with the epilepsy syndrome.|313307000

Likewise,
the menstrual cycle|78456001
in women|224526002
with epilepsy|313307000
can
influence
patterns|272135003
of seizure recurrence.|91175000|246455001

Catamenial epilepsy|230444006
is
the term denoting seizures|91175000
linked
to the menstrual cycle.[13]|78456001

There
are
different causes|263735002|134198009
of epilepsy|313307000
that
are
common|72906007
in certain age groups.|17162000|424144002|261586004|17162000|424144002|160481000

When
investigating|116698004
the causes|134198009
of seizures,|91175000
it
is
important to
understand|66216009
physiological conditions|1360005|260905004
that
may
predispose
the individual|125676002|385435006
to a seizure occurrence.|91175000|272120004

Several clinical|261028005|58147004
and
experimental data
have
implicated
the failure|76797004
of blood?brain barrier|20245001
(BBB
)
function|246464006
in triggering|410658008
chronic|90734009
or
acute seizures,|272118002|91175000
[15][16][17][18][19]
some
studies|110465008|224699009
implicate
the interactions
between a common blood protein?albumin|72906007|30159006|52454007
and
astrocytes.|78399007

These findings|404684003
suggest
that acute seizures|272118002|91175000
are
a predictable consequence|103332005
of disruption|76555007
of the BBB
by
either
artificial|71967004
or
inflammatory mechanisms.|257544000

In addition,|260364009
expression|10012005
of drug resistance molecules|31438003|290005005
and
transporters
at the BBB
are
a significant mechanism|386134007|257544000
of resistance|30714006
to commonly
used|394850002
anti-epileptic drugs.[21][22]

Mutations|55446002
in several genes|261028005|67271001
have
been
linked
to several types|261028005|261664005
of epilepsy.|313307000

Some genes|67271001
that
code
for protein sub units|88878007|261089000|258666001|88878007|118555000|258666001
of voltage-gated
and
ligand-gated ion channels|48006008|255592004
have
been
associated|47429007
with forms|246176004
of generalized epilepsy|19598007
and
infantile seizure syndromes.[23]|3658006|313307000|264657009|263784005|313307000|264657009

One speculated mechanism|421379005|257544000
for some
forms|246176004
of inherited epilepsy|255404009|313307000
are
mutations|55446002
of the genes|67271001
that
code
for sodium channel proteins|39972003|255592004|88878007
;
these defective sodium channels|39972003|255592004
stay
open|56116003
for too long, thus|255511005
making
the neuron|47220008
hyper-excitable.|44548000|102893002

Glutamate,|430503006|104697004
an excitatory neurotransmitter,|35069000
may
,
therefore,
be
released|68776005|129299003
from these neurons|47220008
in large amounts,|255509001|107651007
which ?
by binding|257768005
with nearby glutamatergic neurons ?|47220008
triggers
excessive calcium|260378005|5540006
(Ca2+
)
release|58000006|68776005|258760001|129299003|115956009
in these post-synaptic cells.|288563008|4421005

Such excessive calcium release|260378005|5540006|58000006|260378005|5540006|68776005|260378005|5540006|258760001|260378005|5540006|129299003|260378005|5540006|115956009
can
be
neurotoxic|19466003
to the affected cell.|247591002|4421005|247591002|362837007|248448006|4421005|248448006|362837007

The hippocampus,|5366008|409925000|361561007
which
contains|42504009
a large volume|255509001|118565006|255509001|419569009
of just
such glutamatergic neurons|47220008
(
and
NMDA receptors,|116647005
which
are
permeable|82540007
to Ca2+ entry
after binding|257768005
of
both
glutamate|430503006|104697004
and
glycine|15331006|47390004
)
,
is
especially vulnerable
to epileptic seizure,|313307000
subsequent|255260001
spread|410677005
of excitation,
and
possible neuronal death.|371930009|47220008|419620001|371930009|47220008|268923008|60022001|47220008|419620001|60022001|47220008|268923008

Another possible mechanism|371930009|257544000|60022001|257544000
involves|248448006
mutations|55446002
leading|236874000
to ineffective GABA|259100002
(
the brain's most common inhibitory neurotransmitter|12738006|72906007|61511001|35069000|258335003|72906007|61511001|35069000
)
action.|129264002

Epilepsy-related mutations|313307000|272151006|55446002|313307000|262094002|55446002
in some non-ion channel genes|48006008|255592004|67271001
have
also
been
identified.|7882003

Much
like the channelopathies
in voltage-gated ion channels,|48006008|255592004
several ligand-gated ion channels|261028005|48006008|255592004
have
been
linked
to some types|261664005
of frontal|81654009
and
generalized epilepsies.|19598007

Epileptogenesis
is
the process|415178003
by which
a normal brain|17621005|12738006|17621005|258335003|258744000|12738006|258744000|258335003
develops
epilepsy|313307000
after trauma,
such as a lesion
on the brain.|12738006|258335003

One|421379005
interesting|225469004
finding|404684003
in animals|387961004
is
that repeated low-level electrical stimulation|27582007|62482003|258395000|27582007|62482003|276625007|27582007|371880002|258395000|27582007|371880002|276625007
to some brain sites|12738006|10546003|258335003|10546003
can
lead|88488004
to permanent increases|6934004|260366006
in seizure susceptibility|91175000|76522002|91175000|118588007
:
in other words,|74964007|255373000
a permanent decrease|6934004|260400001|6934004|260370003
in seizure "threshold."|91175000|118589004
This phenomenon,
known|36692007
as kindling
(
by analogy
with the use|277889008|419385000
of burning twigs to|90673000|62404004
start|255395001
a larger fire|255509001|80032004|255509001|257195008|263768009|80032004|263768009|257195008
)
was
discovered
by Dr.|309343006

Graham Goddard
in 1967.

It
is
important to
note
that
these "
kindled
" animals|387961004
do
not
experience
spontaneous seizures.|5054005|91175000

Chemical stimulation|441900009|122545008
can
also
induce|16404004
seizures|91175000
;
repeated exposures|27582007|71677004|27582007|242575009
to some pesticides|59545008
have
been
shown
to
induce|16404004
seizures|91175000
in
both
humans|278412004
and
animals.|387961004

One mechanism|421379005|257544000
proposed
for this
is
called excitotoxicity.

The roles
of kindling
and
excitotoxicity,
if
any,
in human epilepsy|278412004|313307000
are
currently hotly|15240007
debated.

Other causes|74964007|134198009
of epilepsy|313307000
are
brain lesions,|301766008
where there
is
scar tissue|70582006|275322007
or
another abnormal mass|263654008|300848003|263654008|118538004
of tissue|85756007
in an area|42798000
of the brain.|12738006|258335003

The complexity|103360007
of understanding|66216009
what seizures|91175000
are
have
led|88488004|236874000
to considerable efforts to|19487008
use|277889008|419385000
computational models
of epilepsy|313307000
to
both
interpret|363714003
experimental
and
clinical data,|58147004
as well as
guide strategies|106384005|303479009
for therapy.|276239002

Physical, emotional,|5880005|285854004|5880005|408453002|19388002|285854004|19388002|408453002
and
social functioning|52639008
of youth|22396007
are
interfered|78235001
specifically
if
seizures|91175000
are
uncontrolled.|19032002

Some other noted consequences|74964007|103332005
on repeated seizures|27582007|91175000
are
neuronal loss,|47220008
gliosis,|81415000
parenchymal microhemorrhages,
excess|260378005
of starch bodies,|412339002|279495008|412339002|123037004
leptomeningeal thickening,|263899003
subpial gliosis,|81415000
perivascular gliosis|255564009|81415000
and
periavascular atrophy.[25]|13331008

Epilepsies|313307000
are
classified|73504009
in five ways|421820001
:

In 1981,
the International League Against Epilepsy (ILAE)|313307000
proposed
a classification scheme|73504009
for individual seizures|125676002|91175000|385435006|91175000
that
remains
in common use.|72906007|277889008|72906007|419385000

This classification|73504009
is
based|418836005
on observation|103705002
(clinical|58147004
and
EEG|54550000
)
rather than
the underlying pathophysiology|386585008
or
anatomy|91723000
and
is
outlined later
on
in this article.

In 1989,
the ILAE
proposed
a classification scheme|73504009
for epilepsies|313307000
and
epileptic syndromes.|313307000

This
can
be
broadly
described
as a two-axis scheme|420797005|39976000|420797005|388282002
having
the cause|134198009
on one axis|421379005|39976000|421379005|388282002
and
the extent|255590007
of localization|257880008
within the brain|12738006|258335003
on the other.|74964007

Since 1997,
the ILAE
have
been
working|261041009
on a new scheme|7147002
that
has
five axes|421820001|39976000|421820001|388282002
:

impairment.[28]|40226000

Seizure types|91175000|261664005
are
organized|385650005
firstly|232714002
according to
whether
the source|260753009
of the seizure|91175000
within the brain|12738006|258335003
is
localized|255471002
(_partial_|255609007
or
_focal_ onset seizures|29753000|77374008
)
or
distributed
(_generalized_ seizures|246545002
).

Partial seizures|29753000
are
further|46053002
divided|422033008
on the extent|255590007
to which awareness|312012004
is
affected.|247591002|248448006

If
it
is
unaffected
,
then
it
is
a _simple partial_ seizure|79348005
;
otherwise
it
is
a _complex partial_|103360007|255609007
(psychomotor) seizure.|193000002

A partial seizure|29753000
may
spread|410677005
within the brain -|12738006|258335003
a process|415178003
known|36692007
as
_secondary generalization_.|2603003|81170007

Generalized seizures|246545002
are
divided|422033008
according to the effect|253861007
on the body|279495008|123037004
but
all
involve|248448006
loss
of consciousness.|106167005

These
include|55919000
absence|2667000|418560003
(petit mal|230413002
)
,
myoclonic,
clonic,|47308002
tonic,
tonic-clonic|47308002
(grand mal|352818000|65155005
)
,
and
atonic seizures.[29]|189198006

Children|410601007|160499008
may
exhibit
behaviors|844005
that
are
easily|36203004
mistaken
for epileptic seizures|313307000
but
are
not
caused|23981006|134198009
by epilepsy.|313307000

These
include|55919000
:

Conversion disorder|20734000|44376007
can
be
distinguished
from epilepsy|313307000
because
the episodes never|272128006
occur|272120004
during sleep|258158006
and
do
not
involve|248448006
incontinence|48340000|165232002
or
self-injury.[30]

Just
as there
are
many types|260396001|261664005
of seizures,|91175000
there
are
many types|260396001|261664005
of epilepsy syndromes.|313307000

Epilepsy classification|313307000|73504009
includes|55919000
more information|242762006
about the person|125676002
and
the episodes|272128006
than seizure type|91175000|261664005
alone,|105529008
such as clinical features|58147004
(
e.g.
,
behavior|844005
during the seizure|91175000
)
and
expected causes.[31]|134198009|264664006

There
are
four main groups|421534005|63161005|261586004|421534005|63161005|160481000
of epileptic syndrome|313307000
which
can
be
further|46053002
divided|422033008
into
:
benign Rolandic epilepsy,|44145005
frontal lobe epilepsy,|230394006
infantile spasms,|28055006
juvenile myoclonic epilepsy,|6204001

etc.

Each type|261664005
of epilepsy|313307000
presents|52101004|246105001
with its own unique combination|89780004
of seizure type,|91175000|261664005
typical age|424144002
of onset,|77374008
EEG findings,|292003
treatment,|276239002|416118004
and
prognosis.|20481000

The most widespread classification|4757001|85333001|73504009
of the epilepsies[27]|313307000
divides|422033008
epilepsy syndromes|313307000
by location|246267002
or
distribution|255464007
of seizures|91175000
(
as
revealed|263857004
by the appearance|386548000|255412001
of the seizures|91175000
and
by EEG|54550000
and
by cause.|134198009

Syndromes
are
divided|422033008
into localization-related epilepsies,|230381009
generalized epilepsies,|19598007
or
epilepsies|313307000
of unknown localization.|261665006|257880008

Localization-related epilepsies,|230381009
sometimes
termed
partial|255609007
or
focal epilepsies,|230381009
arise|68727004
from an epileptic focus,|313307000|87017008|313307000|363702006
a small portion|255507004|260726005
of the brain|12738006|258335003
that
serves
as the irritant driving|412453003|129060000|263789000|129060000
the epileptic response.|313307000

Generalized epilepsies,|19598007
in contrast,
arise|68727004
from many independent foci|371153006|87017008
(multifocal epilepsies|524008|313307000
)
or
from epileptic circuits|313307000
that
involve|248448006
the whole brain.|260232004|12738006|260232004|258335003

Epilepsies|313307000
of unknown localization|261665006|257880008
remain
unclear
as to
whether
they
arise|68727004
from a portion|260726005
of the brain|12738006|258335003
or
from more widespread circuits.|242762006|85333001

Epilepsy syndromes|313307000
are
further|46053002
divided|422033008
by presumptive cause|134198009
:
idiopathic, symptomatic,|54690008|264931009
and
cryptogenic.|54690008

In general, idiopathic epilepsies|60132005|54690008|313307000
are
thought|88952004
to
arise|68727004
from genetic abnormalities|3950001|276654001|255395001|276654001
that
lead|88488004
to alteration
of basic neuronal regulation.|47220008|418836005|47220008

Symptomatic epilepsies|264931009|313307000
arise|68727004
from the effects|253861007
of an epileptic lesion,|313307000
whether
that lesion
is
focal,|87017008
such as a tumor,|108369006
or
a defect|6920004
in metabolism|47722004
causing|23981006
widespread injury|85333001
to the brain.|12738006|258335003

Cryptogenic epilepsies|54690008|313307000
involve|248448006
a presumptive lesion
that
is
otherwise difficult|52925006
or
impossible to uncover|255368006
during evaluation.|386053000

The genetic component|3950001|246093002|255395001|246093002
to epilepsy|313307000
is
receiving
particular interest|225469004
from the scientific community.|133928008

Conditions|260905004
such as ring chromosome 20 syndrome|23686004
(r|24028007
(20
)
)
are
gaining acknowledgment,|35105006|255396000|260366006|260369004|398092000
and
although
only 60 cases|50607009|398241000|50607009|413769002|420295001|398241000|420295001|413769002
have
been
reported|229059009|223458004
in the literature since 1976,
"more widespread cytogenetic chromosomal karyotyping|242762006|85333001|91272006|312948004
in nonetiological cases|398241000|413769002
of epilepsy"|313307000
is
likely.[33]|2931005|264667004

Some epileptic syndromes|313307000
are
difficult to|52925006
fit|91175000|102499006
within this classification scheme|73504009
and
fall|1912002
in the unknown localization/etiology category.|261665006|257880008|134198009

People|125676002
with seizures|91175000
that
occur|272120004
only
after specific precipitants|69658003
("provoked seizures"|410658008|91175000
)
,
have
"
epilepsies|313307000
"
that fall|1912002
into this category.

Febrile convulsions|41497008
are
an example
of seizures|91175000
bound|75958009|257768005|418131003
to a particular precipitant.

Landau-Kleffner syndrome|230438007
is
another epilepsy|313307000
that,
because of its variety
of EEG distributions,|54550000|255464007
falls|1912002
uneasily
in clear categories.|263707001

What
can
be
even more confusing|286933003
is
that certain syndromes,|17162000
such as West syndrome,|28055006
featuring
seizures|91175000
such as infantile spasms,|28055006
can
be
classified|73504009
as idiopathic, syndromic,|54690008
or
cryptogenic|54690008
depending
on cause|134198009
and
can
arise|68727004
from
both
focal|87017008
or
generalized epileptic lesions.|60132005|313307000

Below
are
some common seizure syndromes|72906007|313307000
:

Epilepsy|313307000
is
usually
treated|28995006
with medication|410942007
prescribed
by a physician|309343006
;
primary caregivers,|63161005|133932002|261424001|133932002
neurologists,|56397003
and
neurosurgeons|45544007
all frequently|70232002
care
for people|125676002
with epilepsy.|313307000

However,
it
has
been
stressed|262188008
that accurate differentiation|263656005
between generalized|60132005
and
partial seizures|29753000
is
especially important
in determining
the appropriate treatment.|276239002|416118004

In some cases|398241000|413769002
the implantation|71861002|25602002
of a stimulator|36645008
of the vagus nerve,|88882009
or
a special diet|67995009|41829006
can
be
helpful.

Neurosurgical operations|83578000
for epilepsy|313307000
can
be
palliative,|363676003
reducing|260400001
the frequency|260864003|272123002
or
severity|272141005
of seizures|91175000
;
or
,
in some patients,|116154003
an operation|83578000
can
be
curative._[citation

_]

The proper initial response|884001|232714002
to a generalized tonic-clonic epileptic seizure|65155005|313307000
is
to
roll
the person|125676002
on the side|182353008
(recovery position to|34026001
prevent
ingestion|111984006
of fluids|32457005|33463005
into the lungs,|39607008
which
can
result|394617004
in choking|249489001
and
death.|419620001|268923008

Should
the person regurgitate,|125676002
this
should
be
allowed
to drip out
the side|182353008
of the person's mouth.|125676002|74262004|125676002|123851003|125676002|21082005|125676002|181220002

The person|125676002
should
be
prevented|116699007
from self-injury
by moving
them away
from sharp edges,|410707003|57183005
and
placing|257557008
something soft|37378003
beneath the head.|69536005|302548004

If
a seizure lasts|91175000
longer|255511005
than 5 minutes,|264706000|258701004|264706000|255507004|264706000|356624006|264605009|258701004|264605009|255507004|264605009|356624006
or
if more|242762006
than one seizure|421379005|91175000
occurs|272120004
without regaining consciousness emergency medical services|106167005|409971007|409971007
should
be
contacted._[citation|11723008|70862002

The mainstay
of treatment|276239002|416118004
of epilepsy|313307000
is
anticonvulsant medications.|255632006|410942007

Often,|70232002
anticonvulsant medication treatment|255632006|18629005
will
be
lifelong
and
can
have
major effects|255603008|253861007
on quality|263496004
of life.|224130005

The choice
among anticonvulsants|255632006
and
their effectiveness|255403003
differs
by epilepsy syndrome.|313307000

Mechanisms,|257544000
effectiveness|255403003
for particular epilepsy syndromes,|313307000
and
side-effects
differ
among the individual anticonvulsant medications.|125676002|255632006|410942007|385435006|255632006|410942007

Some general findings|60132005|404684003|60132005
about the use|277889008|419385000
of anticonvulsants|255632006

is
no seizures|91175000

The goal|410518001
for these procedures|71388002

The evaluation|386053000
for epilepsy surgery|313307000|83578000
is
designed to
locate
the "epileptic focus"|313307000|87017008|313307000|363702006
(
the location|246267002
of the epileptic abnormality|313307000|276654001

Physicians|309343006
will
also
confirm|59156000

sure that spells
arise|68727004

neurological examination,|84728005
routine EEG,|50811001|54550000
Long-term video-EEG monitoring,|252738008
neuropsychological evaluation,|386053000

Some epilepsy centers|313307000|26216008
use|277889008|419385000
intracarotid sodium amobarbital test|262275002|39972003

Certain lesions|17162000
require
Long-term video-EEG monitoring|252738008
with the use|277889008|419385000
of intracranial electrodes|303231004|16470007
if
noninvasive testing|22762002|22762002|272393004
was
inadequate to|71978007
identify|7882003
the epileptic focus|313307000|87017008|313307000|363702006

Brain mapping|252741004
by the technique|272394005
of cortical electrical stimulation|68594002|40146001|50403003

in the process|415178003
of invasive testing|10179008|10179008|272393004
in some patients.|116154003

The most common surgeries|4757001|72906007|83578000
are
the resection|118292001|128303001
of lesions
like tumors|108369006
or
arteriovenous malformations,|234141001|403966009
which,
in the process|415178003
of treating|28995006
the underlying lesion,
often|70232002
result|394617004
in control|31509003
of epileptic seizures|313307000
caused|23981006|134198009
by these lesions.

Other lesions|74964007
are
more subtle|242762006
and
feature epilepsy|313307000
as the main|63161005
or
sole symptom.|57999000

The most common form|4757001|72906007|246176004
of intractable epilepsy|445355009
in these disorders|64572001
in adults|133936004
is
temporal lobe epilepsy|193000002
with hippocampal sclerosis,|5366008|43846000
and
the most common type|4757001|72906007|261664005
of epilepsy surgery|313307000|83578000
is
the anterior temporal lobectomy,|255549009|445942002
or
the removal|118292001|128303001
of the front portion|255549009|260726005
of the temporal lobe|78277001|180921000
including|55919000
the amygdala|4958002
and
hippocampus.|5366008|409925000|361561007

Some neurosurgeons|45544007
recommend
selective amygdalahippocampectomy
because of possible benefits|371930009|60022001
in postoperative memory|262061000|303116000|262061000|106136008
or
language function.|61909002|246464006

Surgery|83578000
for temporal lobe epilepsy|193000002
is
effective, durable,|255403003|254648000

Despite the efficacy
of epilepsy surgery,|313307000|83578000
some patients|116154003
decide
not to
undergo
surgery|83578000
owing to fear|1402001
or
the uncertainty|64957009
of
having
a brain operation.|70586009

Palliative surgery|363676003|83578000
for epilepsy|313307000
is
intended to|361269008
reduce|260400001
the frequency|260864003|272123002
or
severity|272141005
of seizures.|91175000

Examples
are
callosotomy|304848009
or
commissurotomy to|59469009
prevent
seizures|91175000
from generalizing|60132005
(
spreading|410677005
to
involve|248448006
the entire brain|258335003
)
,
which
results|394617004
in a loss
of consciousness.|106167005

This procedure|71388002
can
therefore
prevent
injury
due to the person falling|125676002|1912002
to the ground
after losing consciousness.|106167005

It
is
performed only|398166005
when
the seizures|91175000
cannot
be
controlled|31509003
by other means.|74964007|255586005

Multiple subpial transection|260396001|70302008
can
also
be
used|394850002
to
decrease|260400001|260370003
the
spread|410677005
of seizures|91175000
across the cortex especially|40146001
when
the epileptic focus|313307000|87017008|313307000|363702006
is
located
near important functional areas|40143009|42798000|246464006|42798000
of the cortex.|40146001

Resective surgery|83578000
can
be
considered
palliative|363676003
if
it
is
undertaken
with the expectation|410517006
that
it
will
reduce|260400001
but
not
eliminate
seizures.|91175000

Hemispherectomy|14247003
involves|248448006
removal|118292001|128303001
or
a functional disconnection|40143009|246464006
of most
or
all
of one half|421379005
of the cerebrum.|11628009|372073000|83678007|263353005

It
is
reserved
for people|125676002
suffering
from the most catastrophic epilepsies,|4757001|313307000
such as those due to Rasmussen syndrome.|42752001|230191005

If
the surgery|83578000
is
performed|398166005
on very young patients|260358002|84422007|116154003
(2?5 years old|264655001|258707000|70753007
)
,
the remaining hemisphere
may
acquire|255396000
some rudimentary motor control|31509003
of the ipsilateral body|255208005|279495008|255208005|123037004
;
in older patients,|70753007|116154003
paralysis|44695005
results|394617004

The word _epilepsy_|255373000|313307000
is
derived
from the Ancient Greek ????????|1451003
_epil?ps?
a_,
which
was
from ????????????
_?pilamb?nein_ "to
take|419652001
hold|421139008
of,
to
seize
",
which in turn|282987006
was
combined|89780004
from ???

and ?????????
_lamb?nein_ "to|226942002|255392003|425953004

In the past,|410513005
epilepsy|313307000
was
associated|47429007
with religious experiences|62458008
and
even demonic possession.

In ancient times,|410669006|417929005
epilepsy|313307000
was
known|36692007
as the "Sacred Disease"|64572001
(
as
described
in a 5th century BC treatise|32088001
by Hippocrates[78]
)
because
people|125676002
thought|88952004
that epileptic seizures|313307000
were
a form|246176004
of attack|217315002|216299002
by demons,
or
that
the visions|281004000
experienced
by persons|125676002
with epilepsy|313307000
were
sent
by the gods.

Among animist Hmong families,|35359004
for example,
epilepsy|313307000
was
understood|66216009
as an attack|217315002|216299002
by an evil spirit,|6524003|422259002
but
the affected person|247591002|125676002|248448006|125676002
could
become
revered
as a shaman|439942005
through these otherworldly experiences.[79]

A chapter
from a Babylonian textbook
of medicine,|410942007
dating|410671006
from about 2000BC
and
consisting
of 40 tablets,|259031006|385055001|259031006|428673006
records
many
of the different seizure types|263735002|91175000|261664005
we
recognize
today,
and
it
emphasizes
the supernatural nature|277302009
of epilepsy,|313307000
[78]
while
the Ayurvedic text
of Charaka Samhita
(
about 400BC
)
,
describes
epilepsy|313307000
as "apasmara",
i.e.,|42146005|22971001
"loss
of consciousness".[78]|106167005

In most cultures,|252398009|61594008
persons|125676002
with epilepsy|313307000
have
been
stigmatized
,
shunned,
or
even
imprisoned|91497007
;
in the Salp?tri?re,|404882002|228877007
the birthplace
of modern neurology,|394591006
Jean-Martin Charcot found people|228210008|404684003|125676002|228210008|125676002
with epilepsy|313307000
side-by-side|182353008
with the mentally
handicapped|29962006
,
those
with chronic syphilis,|90734009|76272004
and
the criminally insane.

In Tanzania|223537007
to this day,|258703001|259032004
as
with other parts|74964007|260726005
of Africa,|223498002
epilepsy|313307000
is
associated|47429007
with possession
by evil spirits,|6524003
witchcraft,|90486004
or
poisoning|75478009
and
is
believed
by many to|260396001
be
contagious.

In ancient Rome,
epilepsy|313307000
was
known|36692007
as the _Morbus Comitialis_
('disease|64572001
of the assembly hall'
)
and
was
seen
as a curse
from the gods.

to this day,|258703001|259032004
in both
the public
and
private spheres,|34258004
but
polls|7472008
suggest
it
is
generally
decreasing|260371004
with time,|410669006
at least
in the developed world
;
Hippocrates
remarked
that epilepsy|313307000
would
cease
to
be
considered
divine
the day|258703001|259032004
it
was
understood.[81]|66216009

Many jurisdictions|260396001
forbid
certain activities|17162000|257733005
to persons|125676002
suffering
from epilepsy.|313307000

The most commonly prohibited activities|4757001|257733005
involve|248448006
operation|83578000
of vehicles|412307009
or
machinery,|20273004
or
other activities|74964007|257733005
in which continuous vigilance|255238004
is
required.

However,
there
are
usually exceptions
for those
who
can
prove|277025001
that
they
have
stabilized|409051000
their condition.|260905004

Those
few whose seizures|91175000
do
not
cause|23981006|134198009
impairment|40226000
of consciousness,|106167005
have
a lengthy aura|410668003|18618006
preceding|236874000
impairment|40226000
of consciousness,|106167005
or
whose seizures only|91175000
arise|68727004
from sleep,|258158006
may
be
exempt
from such restrictions,|263856008
depending
on local laws.|255470001

There
is
an ongoing debate|255238004
in bioethics over _|21481007
who_
should
bear|106970005
the burden
of ensuring
that
an epilepsy patient|313307000|116154003
does
not
drive|247750002
a car|71783008
or
fly|367378007|10147004
an airplane.

In the U.S.,|223688001
people|125676002
with epilepsy|313307000
can
drive|247750002
if
their seizures|91175000
are
controlled|31509003
with treatment|276239002|416118004
and
they
meet|229057006
the licensing requirements
in their state.|398070004

The amount|107651007
of time|410669006
someone
needs|410525008|103325001
to
be
free|37837009
of seizures|91175000
varies
in different states,|263735002|398070004
but
is
most likely to|4757001|2931005
be
between three months|421291004|258706009
and
a year.|258707000|259039008

The majority
of the 50 states|398070004
place|257557008|421066005
the burden
on patients to|116154003
report|229059009|223458004
their condition|260905004
to appropriate licensing authorities
so
that
their privileges
can
be
revoked
where appropriate.

A minority|410599005|255606000
of states|398070004
place|257557008|421066005
the burden
of reporting|223458004
on the patient's physician.|116154003|309343006

After reporting|223458004
is
carried out,|288345009
it
is
usually
the driver's|236320001
licensing
agency|224877003
that
decides
to
revoke
or
restrict|263856008
a driver's license.|236320001

In the UK,
it
is
the responsibility
of the patients to|116154003
inform|410938009|223458004
the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA)|236320001|412307009|224877003|236320001|261324000|224877003
if
they
have
epilepsy.|313307000

The DVLA rules|10828004
are
quite complex,[85]|103360007
but
in summary,
[86]
those who
continue|255238004
to
have
seizures|91175000
or
who
are
within 6 months|258706009
of medication change|182838006
may
have
their licence
revoked.

A person|125676002
must
be
seizure free|370994008
of an 'awake' seizure|248218005|91175000
for 12 months|258706009
(
or
had
only '|50607009|420295001
sleep|258158006
' seizures|91175000
for 3 years|260313008|258707000
or
more
)
before
they
can
apply|410618006|417924000
for a license.

A doctor|309343006
who
becomes
aware|312012004
that
a patient|116154003
with uncontrolled epilepsy|19032002|313307000
is
continuing|255238004
to
drive|247750002
has
,
after
reminding|223452003
the patient|116154003
of their responsibility,
a duty to
break
confidentiality|225487001
and
inform|410938009|223458004
the DVLA.

The doctor|309343006
should
advise|424900004
the patient|116154003
of the disclosure
and
the reasons|410666004
why
their failure to|76797004
notify|185087000
the agency|224877003
obliged
the doctor to|309343006
act.

In many countries,|223369002
persons|125676002
with any history|392521001
of epilepsy|313307000
are
generally
disqualified
for the medical certifications|103695000
required
for all classes|258391009
of pilot licenses.|308040008

In the United States,|223688001
FAA regulations
disqualify
applicants
for medical certification|103695000
with a history|392521001
of epilepsy,|313307000
although
the final decision|42796001
is
made
by FAA headquarters,
and
rare exceptions|84638005|103356009
are
sometimes
made
for persons|125676002
who
have
had
only
an isolated seizure|230433003
or
two|420797005
in childhood|68433009
and
have
remained free|37837009
of seizures|91175000
in adulthood|41847000
without medication.[88][89]|410942007

In the United Kingdom,|223860005
a sub-class|261089000|258391009|118555000|258391009
of pilots license|308040008
called
the National Private Pilot's License|308040008
has
the same medical requirement standards|262126009|74188005
as the DVLA motoring requirements,
hence epilepsy sufferers|313307000
with one year absence|421379005|258707000|2667000|421379005|258707000|418560003|421379005|259039008|2667000|421379005|259039008|418560003
free|37837009
can
,
with certain exceptions,|17162000
fly|367378007|10147004
over UK airspace
in certain types|17162000|261664005
of aircraft.[90]|21753002|264705001|21753002|264703008

Many notable people,|125676002
past|410513005
and
present,|52101004|246105001
have
carried|288345009
the diagnosis|439401001
of epilepsy.|313307000

In many cases,|398241000|413769002
their epilepsy|313307000
is
a footnote
to their accomplishments
;
for some,
it
played|300776002
an integral role|263786007
in their fame.

Historical diagnoses|439401001|392521001|439401001
of epilepsy|313307000
are
not always certain|17162000|255544004
;
there
is
controversy
about what
is
considered
an acceptable amount|107651007
of evidence|18669006
in support|9096001|243114000
of such
a diagnosis.|439401001

Epilepsy|313307000
occurs|272120004
in a number|410680006|410681005
of other animals|74964007|387961004
including|55919000
dogs|448771007
and
cats.|448169003|388618001

It
is
the most common brain disorder|4757001|72906007|81308009
in dogs.[91]|448771007
