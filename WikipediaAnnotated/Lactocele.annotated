A
*
*galactocele|42385006
*
*
is
a cystic tumor containing milk|42385006|108369006|42504009
or
a milky substance|263811001|105590001
that
is
usually
located
in the mammary glands.

It
is
caused|23981006|134198009
by a protein plug|88878007|303480007
that blocks|26036001
off the outlet.

Once lactation|169741004|63158009
has
ended|385656004|422117008
the cyst|441457006|103552005
should
resolve
on its own
without intervention.|225334002

A galactocele|42385006
does
not
cause|23981006|134198009
infection
as the milk|3718001|119321005|70813002
within
is
sterile|261029002|15296000
and
has
no outlet
for which to
become
contaminated.|62604006

Attempts
to
drain|32712000
the cyst|441457006|103552005
are
unsuccessful|385671000
because
the protein plug|88878007|303480007
remains
intact|11163003
and
milk production|3718001|119321005|70813002
continues.|255238004

Galactocele|42385006
may
be
associated|47429007
with oral contraceptive use.[1]|26643006|417122000|26643006|348649005|423938009|277889008|423938009|419385000|5935008|277889008|5935008|419385000
