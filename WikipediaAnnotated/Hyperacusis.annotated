*Hyperacusis|25289003
*
*
(also
spelled|83166007
*
*hyperacousis
*
*
)
is
a health condition|263775005|260905004
characterized
by an over-sensitivity|21481007|35209006|21481007|365705006
to certain frequency|17162000|260864003|17162000|272123002
ranges
of sound|68325009
(
a collapsed tolerance|271787007|228432001|271787007|77472006|271787007|71412006|52071002|228432001|52071002|77472006|52071002|71412006
to usual environmental sound|276339004|276339004|68325009
).

A person|125676002
with severe hyperacusis|24484000|25289003
has
difficulty|371157007
tolerating
everyday sounds,|69620002
some
of which
may
seem
unpleasantly
loud|24547000
to
that person|125676002
but
not
to others.[1]|74964007

It
can
be
acquired|255396000
as a result|394617004
of damage|37782003
sustained|263892007
to the hearing apparatus,|117590005
or
inner ear.|302462009|181189006

There
is
speculation
that
the efferent portion|33843005|260726005
of the auditory nerve|8598002|113313006
(olivocochlear bundle|3153003
)
has
been
affected|247591002|248448006
(efferent meaning fibers|33843005|255586005|400293002|33843005|255586005|37202001
that
originate
in the brain|12738006|258335003
which
serve
to
regulate
sounds
).

This theory
suggests
that
the efferent fibers|33843005|400293002|33843005|37202001
of the auditory nerve|8598002|113313006
are
selectively
damaged|37782003
,
while
the hair cells|52148002
that
allow
the hearing|47078008|118230007
of pure tones|223628004|258691001
in an audiometric evaluation|21727005|21727005|386053000
remain
intact.|11163003

In cases|398241000|413769002
not
involving|248448006
aural trauma|1910005|1910005
to the inner ear,|302462009|181189006
hyperacusis|25289003
can
also
be
acquired|255396000
as a result|394617004
of damage|37782003
to the brain|12738006|258335003
or
the neurological system.|1199008|246333005

In these cases,|398241000|413769002
hyperacusis|25289003
can
be
defined
as a cerebral processing problem|415178003|55607006
specific|69658003
to
how
the brain|12738006|258335003
perceives|81742003
sound.|68325009

In rare cases,|84638005|398241000|84638005|413769002|103356009|398241000|103356009|413769002
hyperacusis|25289003
may
be
caused|23981006|134198009
by a vestibular disorder.

This type|261664005
of hyperacusis,|25289003
called
vestibular hyperacusis,|279732009|25289003|181188003|25289003
is
caused|23981006|134198009
by the brain|12738006|258335003
perceiving|81742003
certain sounds|17162000
as motion input|56219004
as well as
auditory input.|255328007

Although
severe hyperacusis|24484000|25289003
is
rare,|84638005|103356009
a lesser form|263796003|246176004
of hyperacusis|25289003
affects|4065008
musicians,
making
it difficult|52925006
for them to
play|300776002
in the very loud environment|260358002|24547000|276339004
of a rock band|77541009|255281001
or
orchestra
which previously
gave|419582001
them no problems.|55607006

It also
makes
attendance
at loud discos|24547000
or
live events|419749002|272379006
difficult|52925006
for a portion|260726005
of the population.|385436007|389109008

Given|419582001
that sound levels|250888003
at such events usually|272379006
exceed
recommended safe levels|258395000
of exposure,|71677004|24932003
this
is
a problem|55607006
which
is
probably
showing
up variations|40885006
between people,|125676002
which
may
be
genetic,|3950001|255395001
or
the result|394617004
of stress|262188008
or
ill-health,|367391008|263775005
or
it
may
be
caused|23981006|134198009
by abnormal response|263654008
in the tensor tympani|5942008|244779001
and
stapedius muscles|81931002
which
function|246464006
in the normal acoustic reflex response|103277005
that
protects
the inner ear|302462009|181189006
from loud sounds._[citation|24547000

40%|259031006
of tinnitus patients|60862001|116154003
complain
of mild hyperacusis.|255604002|25289003

The most common cause|4757001|72906007|134198009
of hyperacusis|25289003
is
overexposure
to excessively high decibel levels|260378005|75540009|259042002|258395000|260378005|371879000|259042002|258395000

).

Some
come
down
with hyperacusis suddenly|25289003
by firing
a gun,
having
an airbag deploy|102384007
in their car,|71783008
experiencing
any extremely loud sound,|24547000|24547000|68325009
taking|419652001

The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders|439401001|87982008|74732009|261004008|87982008|74732009
(DSM
that
is
published
by the American Psychiatric Association|27296002|263534001|27296002|272151006
lists
hyperacusis|25289003
as one|421379005
of the possible signs|371930009|72670004|60022001|72670004
indicating|410535002
phencyclidine|9721008|20857001
(PCP
or
Angel-dust|9721008
)
intoxication.

Causes|134198009
include|55919000
,
but
are
not
limited|255469002
to
:

In cochlear hyperacusis|80169004|25289003
(
the most common form|4757001|72906007|246176004
of hyperacusis|25289003
)
,
the symptoms
are
ear pain,|16001004
annoyance,
and
general intolerance|60132005|29544009
to any
sounds
that
most people|125676002
don't
notice
or
consider
unpleasant.

Crying spells|28263002
or
panic attacks|225624000
may
result|394617004
from cochlear hyperacusis.|80169004|25289003

As many|260396001
as 86%
of hyperacusis sufferers also|25289003
have
tinnitus.[3]|60862001

In vestibular hyperacusis,|279732009|25289003|181188003|25289003
the sufferer
may
experience
feelings|285854004
of dizziness,|404640003|399153001
nausea,|422587007
or
a loss
of balance|249982003|78933003|282295000
when
sounds
of certain pitches|17162000|51104005
are
present.|52101004|246105001

For instance,
people|125676002
with vestibular hyperacusis|279732009|25289003|181188003|25289003
may
feel|285854004
like they
are
falling|1912002
and
as a result involuntarily grimace|394617004|39960009
and
clutch
for something to brace|360316004|415686002
themselves
with.

The degree|258395000|246173007
to which
a sufferer
is
affected|247591002|248448006
depends
not only
on the overall severity|272141005
of
that person's symptoms|125676002
but
also
on
whether
the person|125676002
can
detect|260373001
sounds
in
that frequency range|260864003|272123002
at the volume|118565006|419569009
in question,|42425007
as well as
on the person's|125676002
preexisting
muscle tone|6918002
and
severity|272141005
of startle response.

Anxiety,|48694002|197480006
stress,|262188008
and/or
phonophobia|313387002
may
be
present|52101004|246105001
in
both
types|261664005
of hyperacusis.|25289003

Someone
with
either
form|246176004
of hyperacusis|25289003
may
develop
avoidant behavior|284489004
in order to
try
to
avoid
a stressful sound situation|68325009
or
to
avoid
embarrassing|263821009
themselves
in a social situation
that
might
involve|248448006
noise.

A person suffering|125676002
from hyperacusis|25289003
might
be
startled
by very low sound levels.|260362008|250888003

Everyday sounds|69620002
like shutting doors,|224751004
ringing|112627000|257380004
phones,|359993007
television,|255712000
running water,|257451007
ticking|106831000
clocks,
chewing gum,|385063000
cooking|106373003
,
normal conversation,|17621005|258744000
eating|48263008
,
dishes,|31487001
and
other sounds|74964007
will
hurt
his/
her ears.|117590005|1910005

In extreme situations even|12565001
the use|277889008|419385000
of earplugs|42380001
fails
to
bring|68369002
relief|224978009
and
the patient|116154003
may
spend
their life trying to|224130005
avoid
all sounds
and
just
stay
at home.|261770009

The most common treatment|4757001|72906007|276239002|4757001|72906007|416118004
for hyperacusis|25289003
is
retraining
therapy|276239002
which
uses|277889008|394850002|260676000|419385000
broadband noise.

Tinnitus Retraining Therapy (TRT),|60862001|276239002
a treatment originally|276239002|416118004
used|394850002
to
treat|395077000
tinnitus,|60862001
uses|277889008|394850002|260676000|419385000
broadband noise to
treat|395077000
hyperacusis.|25289003

Pink noise|371243003
can
also
be
used|394850002
to
treat|395077000
hyperacusis.|25289003

By listening to|37931006
broadband
noise
at soft levels|37378003|258395000
for a disciplined period|259037005
of time|410669006
each day,|258703001|259032004
patients|116154003
can
rebuild
(i.e.,|42146005|22971001
re-establish|228877007|263748003
)
their tolerances|71412006
to sound.|68325009

Another treatment method|276239002
is
the Berard Auditory Integration Training.|255328007|118629009

When
seeking treatment,|276239002|416118004
it
is
important
that
the physician|309343006
determine
the patient's Loudness Discomfort Levels (LDL)|116154003|24547000|367391008|258395000|116154003|24547000|87128005|258395000
so
that hearing tests|398171003
(brainstem|15926001|180925009
auditory|255328007
evoke|410658008
response
)
or
other diagnostic tests|74964007|103693007
which
involve|248448006
loud noise|24547000
(MRI|113091000
do
not
worsen|230993007|390772001
the patient's tolerance|116154003|228432001|116154003|77472006|116154003|71412006
to sound.|68325009

Steroids|116566001
are
used|394850002
to
treat|395077000
hyperacusis|25289003
within 72 hours|123028004
of the onset|77374008
of the condition._[citation|260905004
