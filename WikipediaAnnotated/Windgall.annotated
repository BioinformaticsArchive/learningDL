Windpuffs usually|28434002
occur|272120004
when
a horse|35354009|388441000|388445009
is
young, especially|84422007
after
he
begins|255395001
work,|261041009
and
are
a chronic problem often|90734009|55607006|70232002
lasting
the rest|258157001
of the animal's life.|387961004|224130005

They
are
fluid-filled sacs|32457005|33463005|255765007
that
are
firm|20583004
to the touch,|386476006|52962008|397624008
almost always soft|37378003
and
are
usually
found|404684003
on the fetlock just|48201008
above the sesamoid bones.|116608008

Windpuffs|28434002
should
be
cool
to the touch.|386476006|52962008|397624008

If
the swelling|423666004|442672001
is
hot,|264018002
it
is
most likely|4757001|2931005
an acute injury|272118002
(
such as one|421379005
from trauma
)
or
a more serious osselet,|242762006|42745003|62772000
than a windpuff.

Windpuffs|28434002
tend
to
increase|260366006
with size|277049003
after strenuous work.|261041009

Concussion|81371004
irritates
the windpuff,
causing|23981006
the area to|42798000
produce
excessive lubrication fluid|423666004|257883005|21639008|257883005
(
a natural role|510009
of the tendon sheath|15434002
or
bursa|13351007|182483003
).

This causes distention|134198009|25322007
of the area,|42798000
resulting|42752001
in swelling.|423666004|442672001

Because
they
are
harmless,
windpuffs|28434002
are
considered
a blemish
rather than
lameness,|16973004|275520000
but
do
indicate|410535002
excess strain.|260378005|48532005|260378005|276768000

This excess strain|260378005|48532005|260378005|276768000
could
develop
into arthritis,|3723001
tendinitis,|34840004
or
bursitis.|84017003

Windpuffs|28434002
are
especially common|72906007
in horses|35354009
with short, upright pasterns|359530003|370544000|367450005|370544000
due to the excess concussion|260378005|81371004
that type|261664005
of conformation|90578002
places|257557008
on the legs.|30021000
