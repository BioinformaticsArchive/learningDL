is
an emerging infectious disease|191415002
caused|23981006|134198009
by
at least three species|276139006|421291004|69658003|263796003|421291004|69658003
of bacteria belonging|409822003
to the genus _Borrelia_.|112277009

_Borrelia burgdorferi sensu stricto_[3]|76327009
is
the main cause|63161005|134198009
of Lyme disease|23502006
in North America,|223503004
whereas
_Borrelia afzelii_|416551001
and
_Borrelia garinii_|113497007
cause|23981006|134198009
most European cases.|414152003|398241000|414152003|413769002|398241000|413769002

The disease|64572001
is
named|27468005
after the towns|288521009
of Lyme
and
Old Lyme,|70753007
Connecticut,|224045000
USA,|223688001
where
a number|410680006|410681005
of cases|398241000|413769002
were
identified|7882003
in 1975.

Although
Allen Steere
realized
that Lyme disease|23502006
was
a tick-borne disease|414018003
in 1978,
the cause|134198009
of the disease|64572001
remained
a mystery
until 1981,
when
_B.

burgdorferi_
was
identified|7882003
by Willy Burgdorfer.

Lyme disease|23502006
is
the most common tick-borne disease|4757001|72906007|414018003
in the Northern Hemisphere.

_Borrelia_|112277009|23502006
is
transmitted|60117003|258150004
to humans|278412004
by the bite|3404009|25272006
of infected ticks|106831000
belonging
to a few species|57176003|69658003
of the genus _Ixodes_|18511007|27524005
("hard ticks"|106832007
).

Early symptoms|264499004
may
include|55919000
fever,|386661006
headache,|25064002
fatigue,|84229001
depression,|35489007|366979004|255339005
and
a characteristic circular skin rash|354652004|271807003
called
erythema migrans (EM).|59032001

Left|7771000
untreated, later symptoms|25265005|260383002
may
involve|248448006
the joints,|39352004|81087007
heart,|80891009|302509004
and
central nervous system.|21483005|278199004

In most cases,|398241000|413769002
the infection
and
its symptoms
are
eliminated
by antibiotics,|255631004
especially
if
the illness|39104002
is
treated early.|28995006|264499004

Delayed
or
inadequate treatment|71978007|276239002|71978007|416118004
can
lead|88488004
to the more serious symptoms,|242762006|42745003
which
can
be
disabling
and
difficult to|52925006
treat.[7]|395077000

Lyme disease|23502006
can
affect|4065008
multiple body systems|260396001|91689009
and
produce
a range
of symptoms.

Not
all patients|116154003
with Lyme disease|23502006
will
have
all symptoms,
and
many
of the symptoms
are
not specific|69658003
to Lyme disease,|23502006
but
can
occur|272120004
with other diseases|74964007|64572001
as well.|20572008

The incubation period|406646006
from infection
to the onset|77374008
of symptoms
is
usually
one|421379005
to two weeks,|420797005|258705008
but
can
be
much shorter|242762006|359530003|242762006|367450005|4757001|359530003|4757001|367450005
(days|258703001
)
,
or
much longer|242762006|255511005|4757001|255511005
(months|258706009
to years|258707000
).[8]

Symptoms most often|70232002
occur|272120004
from May
through September,
because
the nymphal stage|362240001|21191007|362240001|371508000|362240001|261612004
of the tick
is
responsible|394851003
for most cases.|398241000|413769002

Asymptomatic infection|28456004
exists
,
but
occurs|272120004
in less|276139006|263796003
than 7%
of infected individuals|125676002|385435006
in the United States.|223688001

Asymptomatic infection|28456004
may
be
much more common|242762006|72906007|4757001|72906007
among those
infected
in Europe.[10]|223502009

Early localized infection|264499004|10443009
is
where the Lyme disease|23502006
has
not yet
spread|410677005
throughout the body.|279495008|123037004

The only area|50607009|42798000|420295001|42798000
affected|247591002|248448006
is
where the infection
has
first|255216001|232714002
come
into contact|11723008|70862002
with the skin.|119325001|39937001|181469002

The classic sign|255301002|72670004|255333006|72670004
of early local infection|264499004|255470001
with Lyme disease|23502006
is
a circular, outwardly|354652004
expanding|70955005
rash|271807003
called erythema chronicum migrans|69588003
(also erythema migrans|59032001
or
EM
)
,
which
occurs|272120004
at the site|10546003
of the tick bite three|409983009|421291004
to thirty days|258703001
after the tick bite.|409983009

The rash|271807003
is
red,|386713009|371240000
and
may
be
warm,
but
is
generally painless.|255350008

Classically,
the innermost portion|260726005
remains
dark red|255419005|386713009|255419005|371240000
and
becomes
indurated
(
is
thicker|246703001
and
firmer|20583004
)
;
the outer edge|261074009|57183005
remains
red|386713009|371240000
;
and
the portion|260726005
in
between clears,|84989007|263707001
giving|419582001
the appearance|386548000|255412001
of a bullseye.

However,
partial clearing|255609007
is
uncommon,|103356009
and
the bullseye
pattern|272135003
more often|242762006|70232002
involves|248448006
central redness.[13]|26216008|386713009|26216008|371240000

EM
is
thought to|88952004
occur|272120004
in about 80%
of infected patients.|116154003

Patients|116154003
can
also
experience
flu-like symptoms,|315642008
such as headache,|25064002
muscle soreness,|68962001
fever,|386661006
and
malaise.|367391008

Lyme disease|23502006
can
progress|385651009
to later
stages|261612004
even
in patients|116154003
who
do
not
develop
a rash.[15]|271807003

Within days|258703001
to weeks|258705008
after the onset|77374008
of local infection,|255470001
the _Borrelia_ bacteria|112277009
may
begin|255395001
to
spread|410677005
through the bloodstream.

EM
may
develop
at sites|10546003
across the body|279495008|123037004
that
bear|106970005
no relation|125677006
to the original tick bite.|19535007|409983009

Another skin condition|422000003
that
is
apparently absent|2667000
in North American patients,|160516002|116154003
but
occurs|272120004
in Europe,|223502009
is
borrelial lymphocytoma,|112277009|19750001|23502006|19750001
a purplish lump|300848003
that
develops
on the ear lobe,|48800003
nipple,|24142002|54468004|265780004
or
scrotum.|264191007|265794003

Other discrete symptoms|74964007
include|55919000
migrating pain|22253000
in muscles,|91727004
joints,|39352004|81087007
and
tendons,|13024002
and
heart palpitations|80891009|80313002|302509004|80313002
and
dizziness|404640003|399153001
caused|23981006|134198009
by changes|243326001|263703002
in heartbeat._[citation|248646004

Various acute neurological problems,|256220008|272118002|299960009
termed neuroborreliosis,
appear
in 10?15%
of untreated patients.|25265005|116154003

These
include|55919000
facial palsy,|280816001
which
is
the loss
of muscle tone|6918002
on one|421379005
or
both sides|182353008
of the face,|89545001|302549007
as well as
meningitis,|7180009
which
involves|248448006
severe headaches,|24484000|25064002
neck stiffness,|161882006
and
sensitivity|35209006|365705006
to light.|56242006|371268001

Radiculoneuritis
causes|134198009
shooting pains|49575005
that
may
interfere|78235001
with sleep,|258158006
as well as
abnormal skin sensations.|247322000|119325001|247322000|39937001|247322000|181469002

Mild encephalitis|255604002|45170000
may
lead|88488004
to memory loss,|48167000
sleep disturbances,|53888004|39898005
or
mood changes.|18963009

In addition,|260364009
some case reports|398241000|229059009|398241000|223458004
have
described
altered
mental status|36456004
as the only symptom|50607009|420295001
seen
in a few cases|57176003|398241000|57176003|413769002
of early neuroborreliosis.[19]|264499004

The disease|64572001
may
also
have
cardiac manifestations|80891009|250255003|80891009|251190009
such as AV block.|233917008

After several months,|261028005|258706009
untreated|25265005
or
inadequately treated patients|28995006|116154003
may
go
on to
develop
severe|24484000
and
chronic symptoms|90734009
that
affect|4065008
many parts|260726005
of the body,|279495008|123037004
including|55919000
the brain,|12738006|258335003
nerves,|3057000
eyes,|81745001
joints|39352004|81087007
and
heart.|80891009|302509004

Many disabling symptoms
can
occur|272120004
,
including|55919000
permanent paraplegia|6934004|60389000
in the most extreme cases.|4757001|12565001|398241000|4757001|12565001|413769002

The associated nerve pain|47429007|3057000|22253000|47429007|256864008|22253000
radiating|8754004
out
from the spine|421060004|44300000|243930007
is
termed Bannwarth syndrome.[21]|48982009

The late disseminated stage|260383002|65709003|21191007|260383002|65709003|371508000|260383002|65709003|261612004
is
where the infection
has
fully
spread|410677005
throughout the body.|279495008|123037004

Chronic neurologic symptoms|90734009|267070008
occur|272120004
in
up to 5%|264706000|264605009
of untreated patients.|25265005|116154003

A polyneuropathy|42345000
that
involves|248448006
shooting pains,|49575005
numbness,|398026008|44077006
and
tingling|162249002
in the hands|85562004
or
feet|56459004|259051005
may
develop.

A neurologic syndrome|1199008
called
Lyme encephalopathy
is
associated|47429007
with subtle cognitive problems,|55607006
such as difficulties|371157007
with concentration|82742001
and
short-term memory.|69262000

These patients|116154003
may
also
experience
profound fatigue.|84229001

However,
other problems,|74964007|55607006
such as depression|35489007|366979004|255339005
and
fibromyalgia,|203102006
are
no more common|242762006|72906007
in people|125676002
who
have
been
infected
with Lyme
than
in the general population.[22][23]|60132005|385436007|264657009|60132005|389109008|264657009

Chronic encephalomyelitis,|90734009|62950007
which
may
be
progressive,|255314001
can
involve|248448006
cognitive impairment,|386806002
weakness|13791008|260407003
in the legs,|30021000
awkward gait,|7006003|271705001

untreated|25265005
Lyme disease|23502006
may
cause|23981006|134198009
frank psychosis,|69322001|191525009
which
has
been
mis-diagnosed|439401001
as schizophrenia|58214004
or
bipolar disorder.|13746004

Panic attacks|225624000
and
anxiety|48694002|197480006
can
occur|272120004
;
there
may
also
be
delusional behavior,|2073000|844005
including|55919000
somatoform delusions,|2073000
sometimes
accompanied
by a depersonalization|79499004
or
derealization syndrome,|280945000
where
the patients|116154003
begin|255395001
to
feel|285854004
detached
from themselves
or
from reality.[24][25]

Lyme arthritis usually|33937009
affects|4065008
the knees.|304679005

In a minority|410599005|255606000
of patients,|116154003
arthritis|3723001
can
occur|272120004
in other joints,|74964007|39352004|74964007|81087007

a chronic skin disorder|27624003|119325001|27624003|39937001|27624003|181469002|90734009|95320005
observed
primarily
in Europe|223502009
among the elderly.|105436006

ACA|60176003
begins|255395001
as a reddish-blue patch|405738005|1522000|405738005|262302002|405738005|385114002|405738005|386028003|405738005|413676000|405738005|421043009

on the backs|123961009
of the hands|85562004
or
feet.|56459004|259051005

The lesion slowly|419443000
atrophies|13331008
over several weeks|261028005|258705008
or
months,|258706009
with the skin|119325001|39937001|181469002

from the genus _Borrelia_.|112277009

Because of their double-membrane envelope,|1305003|83097008
_Borrelia_|112277009|23502006
are
often mistakenly|70232002
described
as Gram negative|258682000|260385009
despite the considerable differences|263735002
in their envelope components|246093002
with Gram-negative bacteria.|81325006

The _Borrelia_ species|112277009|131221004
that
are
Lyme-related|272151006|262094002
are
collectively
known|36692007
as
_Borrelia burgdorferi|76327009
sensu lato_,
and
show
a great deal|255509001|263768009
of genetic diversity.[29]|64195000

_Borrelia burgdorferi|76327009
sensu lato_
is
made up|255532002|353734004
of 18 closely related species,|272151006|69658003|262094002|69658003
but
only three clearly|50607009|421291004|420295001|421291004
cause|23981006|134198009
Lyme disease|23502006
:
_B.

(predominant
in North America,|223503004

in Europe,|223502009
_B.

in Eurasia.

Some studies|110465008|224699009
have
also
proposed
_B.

bissettii_
and
_B.

valaisiana_
may
sometimes
infect
humans,|278412004
but
these species|69658003
do
not
seem
to
be
important causes|134198009
of disease.[31][32]|64572001|264664006

Lyme disease|23502006
is
classified|73504009
as a zoonosis,|28762008
as
it
is
transmitted|60117003|258150004
to humans|278412004
from a natural reservoir|510009|257687008
among rodents|388077003
by ticks|106831000
that
feed|129007004
on
both
sets
of hosts.

Hard-bodied ticks|106832007
of the genus _Ixodes_|18511007|27524005
are
the main vectors|63161005|260529001
of Lyme disease|23502006
(also
the vector|260529001
for _Babesia_|35029001
).

Most infections
are
caused|23981006|134198009
by ticks|106831000
in the nymphal stage,|362240001|21191007|362240001|371508000|362240001|261612004
as
they
are
very small|260358002|255507004
and
may
feed|129007004
for long periods|255511005|259037005
of time|410669006
undetected.

Larval ticks|106831000
are
very rarely|260358002|103356009
infected.[34]

Tick bites often|409983009|70232002
go
unnoticed
because of the small size|255507004|277049003
of the tick
in its nymphal stage,|362240001|21191007|362240001|371508000|362240001|261612004
as well as
tick secretions|46242002
that
prevent
the host
from feeling|285854004
any itch|424492005
or
pain|22253000
from the bite.|3404009|25272006

However,
transmission|258150004
is
quite rare,|84638005|103356009
with only about 1%|50607009|420295001
of recognized tick bites|409983009
resulting|42752001
in Lyme disease|23502006
;
this
may
be
because
an infected tick
must
be
attached|102491009
for
at least
a day|258703001|259032004
for transmission to|258150004
occur.[35]|272120004

In Europe,|223502009
the vector|260529001
is
_Ixodes ricinus_,|89126000
which
is
also
called
the sheep tick|89126000
or
castor bean tick.|89126000

In China,|223581004
_Ixodes persulcatus_|4971004
(
the taiga tick|4971004
)
is
probably
the most important vector.|4757001|260529001

In North America,|223503004
the black-legged tick|76387006
or
deer tick|76387006
(_Ixodes scapularis_|76387006
)
is
the main vector|63161005|260529001
on the east coast.[34]

The lone star tick|54089000
(_Amblyomma americanum_|54089000
)
,
which
is
found|404684003
throughout the Southeastern United States|223688001
as far west|46053002
as Texas,|421662006
is
unlikely to
transmit|60117003
the Lyme disease _Spirochaete_ _Borrelia burgdorferi_,|23502006|38732005|76327009|23502006|115169007|76327009|23502006|76327009|23502006|418489004|76327009
[38]|264670000
though
it
may
be
implicated
in a related syndrome|272151006|262094002
called
southern tick-associated rash illness,|444100007
which
resembles
a mild form|255604002|246176004
of Lyme disease.[39]|23502006

On the West Coast
of the United States,|223688001
the main vector|63161005|260529001
is
the western black-legged tick|76387006
(_Ixodes pacificus_|592002
).

The tendency
of this tick species to|69658003
feed|129007004
predominantly
on host species|69658003
such as lizards|2773008
that
are
resistant|30714006
to _Borrelia_ infection|240668005
appears
to
diminish|1250004
transmission|258150004
of Lyme disease|23502006
in the West.[41][42]

While
Lyme spirochetes|115169007|419328001|418489004
have
been
found|404684003
in insects|106763003
as well as
ticks,|106831000
[43]
reports|229059009|223458004
of actual infectious transmission|258150004
appear
to
be
rare.|84638005|103356009

Lyme spirochetes|115169007|419328001|418489004
have
been
found|404684003
in semen[45]|264337003|6993007
and
breast milk,|226789007
[46]
but
transmission|258150004
has
not
been
known|36692007

take|419652001
place|257557008|421066005
through sexual contact.|365952006|11723008|365952006|70862002

Transmission|258150004
across the placenta|62669004|181455002
during pregnancy|289908002
has
not
been
demonstrated
,
and
no consistent pattern|385433004|272135003
of teratogenicity|58694006
or

has
been
identified.|7882003

As
with a number|410680006|410681005
of other spirochetal diseases,
adverse pregnancy outcomes|289908002|394617004
are
possible|371930009|60022001
with untreated infection|25265005
;
prompt treatment|276239002|416118004
with antibiotics|255631004
reduces|260400001
or
eliminates
this risk.[48][49]|30207005

Pregnant Lyme-disease patients|77386006|23502006
cannot
be
treated|28995006
with the first-choice antibiotic,|255216001|255631004|232714002|255631004
doxycycline|372478003
(
see|281004000
below
)
,
as
it
is
potentially harmful
for the fetus.|83418008

Instead,
erythromycin|372694001
is
usually
given|419582001
;
it
is
less effective|276139006|255403003|276139006|254648000|263796003|255403003|263796003|254648000
against the disease|64572001
but
harmless
for the fetus.[48]|83418008

Ticks|106831000
that transmit _B.|60117003

burgdorferi_
to humans|278412004
can
also
carry|288345009
and
transmit several other parasites,|60117003|37763007
such as _Theileria microti_|91475005
and
_Anaplasma phagocytophilum_,|420364006
which
cause|23981006|134198009
the diseases babesiosis|64572001|21061004
and
human granulocytic anaplasmosis (HGA),|427481004|256909001
respectively.

Among early Lyme disease patients,|264499004|23502006|116154003
depending
on their location,|246267002
2?12%|260306008
will
also
have
HGA
and
2?40%|260306008|259031006
will
have

Ticks|106831000
in certain regions,|17162000|410673009
including|55919000
the landscapes
along the eastern Baltic Sea,|225742004
also
transmit|60117003
tick-borne encephalitis.[52]|414093008|398783009

Coinfections
complicate|255302009
Lyme symptoms,
especially diagnosis|439401001
and
treatment.|276239002|416118004

It
is
possible|371930009|60022001
for a tick to
carry|288345009
and
transmit one|60117003|421379005
of the coinfections
and
not _Borrelia_,|112277009|23502006
making
diagnosis|439401001
difficult|52925006
and
often elusive.|70232002

The Centers for Disease Control|26216008|64572001|31509003
studied|110465008|224699009
100 ticks|106831000
in rural New Jersey,|421509005
and
found|404684003
55%|264691008
of the ticks|106831000
were
infected
with
at least
one|421379005
of the pathogens.[53]|264418008

_Borrelia burgdorferi_|76327009
can
spread|410677005
throughout the body|279495008|123037004
during the course|288524001
of the disease,|64572001
and
has
been
found|404684003
in the skin,|119325001|39937001|181469002

peripheral nervous system,|3058005
and
central nervous system.|21483005|278199004

Many
of the signs|72670004
and
symptoms
of Lyme disease|23502006
are
a consequence|103332005
of the immune response|35024006
to the spirochete|38732005|115169007|418489004
in those tissues.[14]|85756007

_B.

burgdorferi_
is
injected|422145002
into the skin|119325001|39937001|181469002
by the bite|3404009|25272006

Tick saliva,|256897009
which
accompanies
the spirochete|38732005|115169007|418489004
into the skin|119325001|39937001|181469002
during the feeding process,|129007004|415178003
contains|42504009
substances|105590001
that
disrupt
the immune response|35024006
at the site|10546003
of the bite.|3404009|25272006

This
provides
a protective environment|276339004
where the spirochete|38732005|115169007|418489004
can
establish|263748003
infection.

The spirochetes multiply|115169007|421206002|421206002|419328001|421206002|418489004|421206002
and
migrate
outward|255543005
within the dermis.|53534000

The host inflammatory response|35024006
to the bacteria|409822003
in the skin|119325001|39937001|181469002
causes|134198009
the characteristic circular EM lesion.|354652004

Neutrophils,|116712007
however,
which
are
necessary to
eliminate
the spirochetes|115169007|419328001|418489004
from the skin,|119325001|39937001|181469002
fail
to
appear
in the developing EM lesion.

This
allows
the bacteria to|409822003
survive
and
eventually
spread|410677005
throughout the body.[57]|279495008|123037004

Days|258703001
to weeks|258705008
following|255260001
the tick bite,|409983009
the spirochetes|115169007|419328001|418489004
spread|410677005
via the bloodstream
to joints,|39352004|81087007
heart,|80891009|302509004
nervous system,|25087005|278196006

where
their presence|386397008
gives|419582001
rise
to the variety
of symptoms
of disseminated disease.|65709003|64572001

The
spread|410677005
of _B.

burgdorferi_
is
aided|62479008|246088000
by the attachment|1431002
of the host protease plasmin|116536008|416117009
to the surface|410678000
of the spirochete.[58]|38732005|115169007|418489004

If
untreated|25265005
,
the bacteria|409822003
may
persist
in the body|279495008|123037004
for months|258706009
or
even years,|258707000
despite
the production
of _B.

burgdorferi_ antibodies|68498002
by the immune system.|116003000

The spirochetes|115169007|419328001|418489004
may
avoid
the immune response|35024006
by decreasing expression|260371004|10012005
of surface proteins|410678000|88878007
that
are
targeted
by antibodies,|68498002
antigenic variation|64392009
of the VlsE surface protein,|410678000|88878007
inactivating
key immune components|255386009|246093002
such as complement,|20823009
and
hiding|6080000|421332005
in the extracellular matrix,|69320009
which
may
interfere|78235001
with the function|246464006
of immune factors.[59][60]|106181007

In the brain,|12738006|258335003
_B.

burgdorferi_
may
induce|16404004
astrocytes to|78399007
undergo
astrogliosis
(proliferation|30217000
followed|367409002
by apoptosis,|20663007
which
may
contribute
to neurodysfunction.

The spirochetes|115169007|419328001|418489004
may
also
induce|16404004
host cells to|4421005
secrete
products
toxic
to nerve cells,|47220008
including|55919000
quinolinic acid|34957004
and
the cytokines IL-6|75777003|30965005
and
TNF-alpha,|8612007
which
can
produce
fatigue|84229001
and
malaise.|367391008

Both
microglia|63483002
and
astrocytes|78399007
secrete
IL-6|30965005
and
TNF-alpha|8612007
in the presence|386397008
of the spirochete.|38732005|115169007|418489004

This cytokine response|75777003
may
contribute
to cognitive impairment.[66]|386806002

disrupt
grey matter connections,|263538003

have
a greater potential|263768009|30207005

that
the chronic secretion|90734009|46242002
of stress hormones|262188008|87568004
as a result|394617004

via the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis.|442320004

Additionally tryptophan,|54821000
a precursor
to serotonin,|33635003|50880007
appears
to
be
reduced|260400001
within the central nervous system (CNS)|21483005|278199004
in a number|410680006|410681005
of infectious diseases|191415002
that
affect|4065008
the brain,|12738006|258335003
including|55919000
Lyme.

Researchers
are
investigating|116698004
if
this neurohormone secretion|46242002
is
the cause|134198009
of neuropsychiatric disorders|64572001
developing
in some patients|116154003
with borreliosis.[71]|240668005|264699005

Exposure|71677004|24932003
to the _Borrelia_ bacterium|112277009
during Lyme disease possibly|23502006|60022001
causes|134198009
a long-lived|255511005|224130005|255511005|419749002
and
damaging inflammatory response,
[72]
a form|246176004
of pathogen-induced autoimmune disease.|264418008|16404004|85828009

The production
of this reaction|263851003
might
be
due to a form|246176004
of molecular mimicry,|290005005|31271002
where _Borrelia_|112277009|23502006
avoid
being
killed|248007002
by the immune system|116003000
by resembling normal parts|17621005|260726005|258744000|260726005
of the body's tissues.[74][75]|85756007

It
is
therefore possible|371930009|60022001
that
if
some chronic symptoms|90734009
come
from an autoimmune reaction,|263680009
this
could
explain
why
some symptoms
persist
even
after the spirochetes|115169007|419328001|418489004
have
been
eliminated
from the body.|279495008|123037004

This hypothesis
may
explain
chronic arthritis|35908007
that
persists
after antibiotic therapy,|281789004
similar
to rheumatic fever,|58718002
but
its wider application|90522003|410618006
is
controversial.[76][77]

Lyme disease|23502006
is
diagnosed clinically|439401001
based|418836005
on symptoms,
objective physical findings|410518001|72670004|260224007|72670004
(
such as erythema migrans,|59032001
facial palsy|280816001
or
arthritis|3723001
or
a history|392521001
of possible exposure|371930009|71677004|371930009|24932003|60022001|71677004|60022001|24932003
to infected ticks,|106831000
as well as
serological blood tests.|68793005|87612001|68793005|119273009|27377004|252275004

The EM rash|271807003
is
not always
a bullseye,
i.e.,|42146005|22971001
it
can
be
red|386713009|371240000
all the way
across.

When
making
a diagnosis|439401001
of Lyme disease,|23502006
health care providers
should
consider
other diseases|74964007|64572001
that
may
cause|23981006|134198009
similar illness.|39104002

Not
all patients|116154003
infected
with Lyme disease|23502006
will
develop
the characteristic bullseye rash,|271807003
and
many
may
not
recall
a tick bite.[78]|409983009

Because of the difficulty|371157007
in culturing _Borrelia_ bacteria|104178000|112277009|104178000|23502006|252398009|112277009|61594008|112277009
in the laboratory,|261904005
diagnosis|439401001
of Lyme disease|23502006
is
typically
based|418836005
on the clinical exam findings|404684003|225886003
and
a history|392521001
of exposure|71677004|24932003
to endemic Lyme areas.|42798000

The EM rash,|271807003
which
does
not
occur|272120004
in all cases,|398241000|413769002
is
considered sufficient to|51117008
establish|263748003
a diagnosis|439401001
of Lyme disease even|23502006
when
serologic blood tests|68793005|87612001|68793005|119273009|27377004|252275004
are
negative.|260385009

Serological testing|27377004|27377004|272393004
can
be
used|394850002
to
support|9096001|243114000
a clinically suspected case,|398241000|415684004|398241000
but
is
not diagnostic|439401001|261004008
by itself.[2]|260306008

Diagnosis|439401001
of late-stage Lyme disease|260383002|21191007|23502006|260383002|371508000|23502006|260383002|261612004|23502006
is
often|70232002
complicated|255302009
by a multifaceted appearance|3988004|386548000|3988004|255412001
and
nonspecific symptoms,|10003008
prompting
one reviewer to|421379005
call
Lyme
the new "great imitator."[81] Lyme disease|7147002|255509001|23502006|7147002|263768009|23502006
may
be
misdiagnosed
as multiple sclerosis,|24700007
rheumatoid arthritis,|69896004
fibromyalgia,|203102006
chronic fatigue syndrome,|51771007

Crohn's disease|34000006
or
other autoimmune|74964007|263680009
and
neurodegenerative diseases.|64572001

Several forms|261028005|246176004
of laboratory testing|269814003
for Lyme disease|23502006
are
available,|103328004
some
of which
have
not
been
adequately
validated.

The most widely used tests|4757001|394850002|269814003|4757001|394850002|272393004
are
serologies,|68793005
which
measure|246445000|272391002
levels|258395000
of specific antibodies|404263002
in a patient's blood.|116154003|87612001|116154003|119273009

These tests|269814003|272393004
may
be
negative|260385009
in early infection,|264499004
as
the body|279495008|123037004
may
not
have
produced
a significant quantity|386134007|107651007
of antibodies,|68498002
but
they
are
considered
a reliable aid|246088000
in the diagnosis|439401001
of later stages|260383002|261612004
of Lyme disease.|23502006

Serologic tests|68793005
for Lyme disease|23502006
are
of limited use|255469002|277889008|255469002|419385000
in people|125676002
lacking|41277001
objective signs|410518001|72670004|260224007|72670004
of Lyme disease|23502006
because of false positive results|90213003|394617004
and
cost.[83]

The serological laboratory tests most widely available|68793005|261904005|103328004|27377004|269814003|103328004
and
employed|224363007
are
the Western blot|48745007
and
ELISA.|76978006

A two-tiered protocol|420797005|258049002
is
recommended
by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|26216008|64572001|31509003|169443000
(CDC
)
:
the sensitive ELISA test|83185005|76978006|269814003|83185005|76978006|83185005|76978006|272393004
is
performed first,|398166005|255216001|398166005|232714002
and
if
it
is
positive|258758003|10828004
or
equivocal, then|42425007
the more specific Western blot|242762006|69658003|48745007
is
run.|418060005|282476009

The reliability
of testing|272393004
in diagnosis|439401001
remains
controversial.

Studies|110465008|224699009
show
the Western blot IgM|48745007
has
a specificity|69658003
of 94?96%
for patients|116154003
with clinical symptoms|58147004
of early Lyme disease.|264499004|23502006

The initial ELISA test|884001|76978006|269814003|884001|76978006|884001|76978006|272393004|232714002|76978006|269814003|232714002|76978006|232714002|76978006|272393004
has
a sensitivity|35209006|365705006
of about 70%,
and
in two-tiered testing,|420797005|420797005|272393004
the overall sensitivity|35209006|365705006
is
only 64%,|50607009|420295001
although
this rises
to 100%
in the subset
of people|125676002
with disseminated symptoms,|65709003
such as arthritis.[87]|3723001

Erroneous test results|277775005
have
been
widely
reported|229059009|223458004
in
both
early|264499004
and
late|260383002
stages|261612004
of the disease,|64572001
and
can
be
caused|23981006|134198009
by several factors,|261028005
including|55919000
antibody cross-reactions|68498002|65145006|263851003|112133008|65145006|263851003
from other infections,|74964007
including|55919000
Epstein-Barr virus|40168006
and
cytomegalovirus,|407444007
[88]
as well as
herpes simplex virus.|314797000

The overall rate
of false positives|90213003
is
low, only about 1|62482003|371880002
to 3%,|260313008
in comparison
to a false negative rate|61707005
of
up to 36%
using|260676000
two-tiered testing.[87]|420797005|420797005|272393004

Polymerase chain reaction (PCR)|258066000
tests|269814003|272393004
for Lyme disease|23502006
have
also
been
developed
to
detect|260373001
the genetic material|256926007
(DNA|24851008
of the Lyme disease spirochete.|23502006|38732005|23502006|115169007|23502006|23502006|418489004

PCR tests|258066000|269814003|258066000|272393004|103338009|269814003|103338009|272393004
are
susceptible|131196009
to false positive results|90213003|394617004
from poor laboratory technique.|11403006|261904005|272394005|255351007|261904005|272394005

Even
when
properly
performed|398166005
,
PCR often|258066000|70232002|103338009|70232002
shows
false negative results|61707005|394617004
with blood|87612001|119273009
and
cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) specimens.|258450006

Hence,
PCR|258066000|103338009
is
not widely
performed|398166005
for diagnosis|439401001
of Lyme disease,|23502006
but
it
may
have
a role
in diagnosis|439401001
of Lyme arthritis,|33937009
because
it
is
a highly sensitive way|255383001
of detecting _ospA_ DNA|260373001|24851008
in synovial fluid.[92]|431898009

With the exception
of PCR,|258066000|103338009
there
is
currently|15240007
no practical means|255586005
for detecting|260373001
the presence|386397008
of the organism,|410653004
as
serologic studies only|27377004|110465008|27377004|224699009
test|269814003|272393004
for antibodies|68498002
of _Borrelia_.|112277009|23502006

High titers|75540009|118590008|371879000|118590008
of
either
immunoglobulin G (IgG)|29246005

immunoglobulin M (IgM) antibodies|74889000|68498002
to _Borrelia_ antigens|112277009|7120007|23502006|7120007
indicate|410535002
disease,|64572001
but
lower titers|261122009|118590008
can
be
misleading,
because
the IgM antibodies|74889000|68498002
may
remain
after the initial infection,|884001|232714002
and
IgG antibodies|29246005|68498002
may
remain
for years.[93]|258707000

Western blot,|48745007
ELISA|76978006
and
PCR|258066000|103338009
can
be
performed|398166005
by
either
blood test|252275004
via venipuncture|396540005|22778000
or
CSF
via lumbar puncture.|277762005|265232001

Though
lumbar puncture|277762005|265232001
is
more definitive|242762006|261002007
of diagnosis,|439401001
antigen capture|7120007
in the CSF
is
much more elusive|242762006|4757001
;
reportedly CSF
yields
positive results|258758003|394617004|10828004|394617004

The diagnosis|439401001
of neurologic infection|128116006
by _Borrelia_|112277009|23502006
should
not
be
excluded|77765009
solely
on the basis|418836005
of normal routine CSF|17621005|50811001|258744000|50811001

such as LTT-MELISA,
[95]
although
the results|394617004

under investigation.|386053000

New research|7147002
indicates|410535002
chemokine CXCL13

be
a possible marker|371930009|60022001

Lyme disease testing|23502006|23502006|272393004
using|260676000
assays|58779000|272392009
whose accuracy|263656005

The CDC
does

these tests,|269814003|272393004
and
a 2005 review

In addition|260364009
to laboratory testing|269814003
on patients,|116154003
ticks|106831000

Neuroimaging
does
not
provide
specific patterns|69658003|272135003
unique
to neuroborreliosis,
but
may
aid|246088000
in differential diagnosis|47965005
and
in understanding|66216009
the pathophysiology|386585008
of the disease.[100]|64572001

Protective clothing|272180002
includes|55919000
a hat,|261368003
long-sleeved shirts|255511005|228194007

long trousers|255511005|228205009
tucked|10942006
into socks|262156000
or
boots.|16056004

Light-colored clothing|371268001|272180002

the tick more easily visible|36203004|24054004
before
it
attaches|102491009
itself.

People|125676002
should
use|277889008|419385000
special care|67995009
in handling
and
allowing outdoor pets
inside homes|261770009

they
can
bring|68369002
ticks|106831000
into the house.|261770009|257630004

and
is
sold
for this purpose.|363675004

Attached ticks|102491009|102491009|106831000
should
be
removed|127485006
promptly,
as
removal|118292001|128303001
within 36 hours|258702006
can
reduce|260400001
transmission rates.|258150004

One study|421379005|110465008|421379005|224699009
concluded
that
a single dose|125681006|277406006|125681006|408102007|50607009|277406006|50607009|408102007
of doxycycline|372478003
given|419582001
within 72 hours|123028004
after a high-risk tick exposure|15508007|409983009
can
prevent
the development|278923009
of Lyme disease.[102]|23502006

A community|133928008
can
prevent
Lyme disease|23502006
by reducing|260400001
the numbers|410680006|410681005
of primary hosts|63161005|261424001
on which
the deer tick|76387006
depends
,
such as rodents,|388077003
other small mammals,|74964007|255507004|387976007
and
deer.|107003000

Reduction|58294000|260400001|289928003
of the deer population|107003000|385436007|107003000|389109008
may
,
over time,|410669006
help
break
the reproductive cycle|44180009
of the deer ticks|76387006
and
their ability to|371150009
flourish
in suburban
and
rural areas.[103]|42798000

An unusual, organic approach to
control|31509003
of ticks|106831000
and
prevention|169443000
of Lyme disease|23502006
involves|248448006
the use|277889008|419385000
of domesticated guineafowl.|107062008|21785004|445025006

Guineafowl|107062008|21785004|445025006
are
voracious consumers
of insects|106763003
and
arachnids,|76222001
and
have
a particular fondness
for ticks.|106831000

Localized use|255471002|277889008|255471002|419385000
of domesticated guineafowl|107062008|21785004|445025006
may
reduce|260400001
dependence|255338002
on chemical pest-control methods.[104]|55284006|275824000

Lyme
and
all other deer tick-borne diseases|74964007|107003000|414018003
can
be
prevented|116699007
on a regional level|410673009|258395000|410673009|276625007|255470001|258395000|255470001|276625007
by reducing|260400001
the deer population|107003000|385436007|107003000|389109008
on which
the ticks|106831000
depend
for reproductive success.|385669000

This
has
been
demonstrated
in the communities|133928008
of Monhegan,
Maine[105]|224064006
and
Mumford Cove,
Connecticut.|224045000

The black-legged|315240009|413464008|15086000|371252007
or
deer tick|76387006
(_Ixodes scapularis_|76387006
)
depends
on the white-tailed deer|82978004
for successful reproduction.|385669000|263767004

For example,
in the
US,
reducing|260400001
the deer population|107003000|385436007|107003000|389109008
to levels|258395000
of 8
to 10
per square mile|56924007|258678002
(
from the current levels|15240007|258395000
of 60
or
more deer|242762006|107003000
per square mile|56924007|258678002
in the areas|42798000
of the country|223369002
with the highest Lyme disease rates|75540009|23502006|371879000|23502006
)
,
the tick numbers|410680006|410681005
can
be
brought|68369002
down
to levels too low to|258395000|62482003|258395000|371880002
spread|410677005
Lyme
and
other tick-borne diseases.|74964007|414018003

However,
such
a drastic reduction|58294000|260400001|289928003
may
be
impractical
in many areas.|42798000

Routine veterinary control|50811001|53216000|31509003
of ticks|106831000
of domestic animals,
including|55919000
livestock,
by use|277889008|419385000
of chemical acaricides|441900009|24686008
can
contribute
to reducing exposure|260400001|71677004|260400001|24932003
of humans|278412004
to ticks.|106831000

Action|129264002
can
be
taken|419652001
to
avoid
getting bitten|3404009|25272006
by ticks|106831000
by
using|260676000
insect repellants,|75627006
for example
those that
contain|42504009
DEET|16968005
(N,N-Diethyl-meta-toluamide|258310009|16968005
).

DEET-containing repellants|16968005|42504009
are
thought|88952004
to
be
moderately effective|255403003|254648000
in the prevention|169443000
of tick bites.[108]|409983009

A recombinant vaccine|398827000
against Lyme disease,|23502006
based|418836005
on the outer surface protein A (OspA)|261074009|410678000|88878007
of _B.

burgdorferi_,
was
developed
by GlaxoSmithKline.

In clinical trials|110465008
involving|248448006
more
than 10,000 people,|125676002
the vaccine,|398827000
called LYMErix,
was
found|404684003
to
confer
protective immunity|58915005
to _Borrelia_|112277009|23502006
in 76%
of adults|133936004
and
100%
of children|410601007|160499008
with only mild|50607009|255604002|420295001|255604002
or
moderate|6736007
and
transient adverse effects.|14803004

LYMErix
was
approved|9571008
on the basis|418836005
of these trials|110465008
by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA)|255620007|18629005
on December 21,
1998.

Following|255260001
approval|9571008
of the vaccine,|398827000
its entry
in clinical practice|58147004
was
slow|419443000
for a variety
of reasons,|410666004
including|55919000
its cost,
which
was
often|70232002
not
reimbursed
by insurance companies.

Subsequently,
hundreds
of vaccine recipients|398827000
reported|229059009|223458004
they
had
developed autoimmune side effects.|263680009

Supported|9096001|243114000
by some patient advocacy groups,|370770001|261586004|370770001|160481000
a number|410680006|410681005
of class-action lawsuits|258391009|129264002
were
filed|12953007
against GlaxoSmithKline,
alleging
the vaccine|398827000
had
caused|23981006|134198009
these health problems.|263775005|55607006

These claims
were
investigated|116698004
by the FDA
and
the [U.S.|223688001

Centers for Disease Control]|26216008|64572001|31509003
(/wiki/U.S._Centers_for_Disease_Control|223688001|26216008|64572001|31509003

,
who
found|404684003
no connection|263538003
between the vaccine|398827000
and
the autoimmune complaints.[111]|263680009|409586006

Despite the lack|41277001
of evidence|18669006
that
the complaints|409586006
were
caused|23981006|134198009
by the vaccine,|398827000
sales
plummeted
and
LYMErix
was
withdrawn|247755007
from the U.S.|223688001

market|284440009
by GlaxoSmithKline
in February 2002,
[112]
in the setting
of negative media coverage|260385009|61695000
and
fears
of vaccine side effects.|398827000

The fate|399166001
of LYMErix
was
described
in the medical literature|74188005
as a "cautionary tale"
;[113]
an editorial
in _Nature_|277302009
cited
the withdrawal
of LYMErix
as an instance
in which "unfounded public fears
place|257557008|421066005
pressures|279046003|13543005
on vaccine developers|398827000
that
go
beyond reasonable safety considerations."[114]|410666004
The original developer|19535007
of the OspA vaccine|398827000
at the Max Planck Institute told _Nature_|385437003|277302009
:
"
This just
shows
how irrational|78205008
the world
can
be...

There
was
no scientific justification|410666004
for the first OspA vaccine LYMErix|255216001|398827000|232714002|398827000
being
pulled."[111]|303370007

New vaccines|7147002|398827000
are
being
researched
using|260676000
outer surface protein C (OspC)|261074009|410678000|25525005
and
glycolipoprotein
as methods|260686004|272394005
of immunization.|127785005

Vaccines|398827000
have
been
formulated
and
approved|9571008
for prevention|169443000
of Lyme disease|23502006
in dogs.|448771007

There
are
currently three Lyme disease vaccines|15240007|421291004|397236006
available.|103328004

The first|255216001|232714002
is
LymeVax,
formulated
by Fort Dodge Laboratories.|261904005

This vaccine|398827000
contains|42504009
intact dead spirochetes|11163003|419620001|115169007|11163003|419620001|11163003|419620001|419328001|11163003|419620001|418489004
which
expose|24932003
the host
to the organism.|410653004

The second vaccine|81170007|398827000|257997001|398827000|288495006|398827000
is
Galaxy Lyme,
or
Intervet-Schering-Plough's vaccine.|398827000

This formula
targets
proteins OspC|88878007
and
OspA.

The OspC antibodies|68498002
kill|248007002
any
of the bacteria|409822003
that
has
not
been
killed|248007002
by the OspA antibodies.|68498002

The third vaccine,|70905002|398827000
Canine Recombinant Lyme,|448771007
formulated
by Merial,
generates
antibodies|68498002
against the OspA protein|88878007
so
that
a tick feeding|129007004
on a vaccinated dog draws|448771007
in blood|87612001|119273009
full|261015003
of anti-OspA antibodies,|68498002
which
kill|248007002
the spirochetes|115169007|419328001|418489004
in the tick's gut|122865005
before
they
are
transmitted|60117003|258150004
to the dog.[117]|448771007

Folk remedies
for tick removal|118292001|128303001
tend
to
be
ineffective,
offer|410527000
no advantages
in preventing|116699007
the transfer|302265009
of disease,|64572001
and
may
increase|260366006
the risks|30207005
of transmission|258150004
or
infection.

The best method|260686004|272394005
is
simply to
pull|303370007
the tick out
with tweezers|32871007
as close|29179001
to the skin|119325001|39937001|181469002
as possible,|371930009|60022001
without twisting,|51795009|129256008
and
avoiding
crushing|60726007|410715000
the body|279495008|123037004
of the tick
or
removing|127485006
the head|69536005|302548004
from the tick's body.|279495008|123037004

The risk|30207005
of infection
increases|260366006
with the time|410669006
the tick
is
attached,|102491009
and
if
a tick
is
attached|102491009
for less|276139006|263796003
than 24 hours,|123027009|259029002
infection
is
unlikely.

However,
since
these ticks|106831000
are
very small, especially|260358002|255507004
in the nymph stage,|362240001|21191007|362240001|371508000|362240001|261612004
prompt detection
is
quite difficult.[101]|52925006

Prevention|169443000
of Lyme disease|23502006
is
an important step in keeping dogs|398298007|448771007|398298007
safe
in endemic areas.|42798000

Prevention education|418526005
and
a number|410680006|410681005
of preventative measures|246445000|367346004
are
available.|103328004

First|255216001|232714002
of all,
for dog owners|448771007
who
live|419749002
near|277752003

who often frequent tick-infested areas,|70232002|70232002|42798000
routine vaccinations|50811001
for their dogs|448771007
is
an important step.[119]|398298007

Another crucial preventative measure|246445000|272391002
is
the use|277889008|419385000
of persistent acaricides,|24686008

(Fipronil,
or
permethrin|410457007|333111009

primarily
the adult stages|133936004|261612004
of Lyme-carrying ticks|288345009|288345009|106831000

the most appropriate antibiotic treatment|4757001|255631004|276239002|4757001|255631004|416118004

with treatment|276239002|416118004
lasting
10
to 28 days.|258703001

If Lyme arthritis symptoms|33937009
fail
to
respond
to a 30-day antibiotic regimen,|258703001|255631004|259032004|255631004
some
recommend
an additional 30 days|260364009|258703001
of antibiotics.|255631004

Alternative choices
are
cefuroxime|372833007
and
cefotaxime.|372704003

Treatment|276239002|416118004
of pregnant women|255409004
is
similar,
but
doxycycline|372478003
should
not
be
used.[124]|394850002

A double blind,|1305003|1305003

placebo-controlled multicenter clinical study|31509003|58147004|110465008|31509003|58147004|224699009
indicated|410535002
three weeks|421291004|258705008
of treatment|276239002|416118004
with intravenous ceftriaxone,|372670001|255560000|372670001
followed|367409002
by 100 days|258703001
of treatment|276239002|416118004
with oral amoxicillin|260548002|372687004

of treatment|276239002|416118004
with ceftriaxone.|372670001

The researchers
noted
the outcome|394617004
should
not
be
evaluated
after the initial antibiotic treatment,|884001|255631004|276239002|884001|255631004|416118004|232714002|255631004|276239002|232714002|255631004|416118004
but
rather 6?12 months afterwards.|258706009

In patients|116154003
with chronic posttreatment symptoms,|90734009
persistent positive levels|258758003|258395000|10828004|258395000
of antibodies|68498002
did
not
seem
to
provide
any useful information
for further care|46053002
of the patient.[127]|116154003

In later stages,|260383002|261612004
the bacteria disseminate|409822003|65709003
throughout the body|279495008|123037004
and
may
cross|65145006
the blood?brain barrier,|20245001
making
the infection more difficult to|52925006
treat.|395077000

Late diagnosed Lyme|260383002|439401001
is
treated|28995006
with oral|260548002
or
intravenous antibiotics,|255631004|255560000|255631004

for a minimum|255605001|255604002
of four weeks.|421534005|258705008

Minocycline|372653009
is
also
indicated|410535002
for neuroborreliosis
for its ability to|371150009
cross|65145006
the blood?brain barrier.[128]|20245001

A number|410680006|410681005
of other alternative therapies
have
been
suggested
,
though
clinical trials|110465008
have
not
been
conducted|844005
,
so
the therapies|276239002
are
not
known|36692007
to
be
scientifically sound.|68325009

For example,
the use|277889008|419385000
of hyperbaric oxygen therapy|18678000
has
been
discussed
by CAM enthusiasts|225471004
as an adjunct
to antibiotics|255631004
for Lyme.

Though
there
are
no published data
from clinical trials to|110465008
support|9096001|243114000
its use,|277889008|419385000
preliminary results|261420005|394617004
using|260676000
a mouse model|447612001|447482001
suggest
its effectiveness|255403003
against _B.

burgdorferi_
both
_
in vitro_
and
_
in vivo_.

Anecdotal clinical research|58147004
has
suggested antifungal azole medications,|373219008|300903003|410942007
such as fluconazole,|387174006
could
be
used|394850002
in the treatment|276239002|416118004
of Lyme,
but
the use|277889008|419385000
of these drugs|410942007
has
yet to
be
tested|272393004
in a controlled study.[131]|31509003|110465008|31509003|224699009

Alternative medicine approaches|350084001|350084001|103379005
include|55919000
bee venom,|421919008
because
it
contains|42504009
the peptide melittin,|52642002
which
has
been
shown
to
exert|19487008
inhibitory effects|61511001|253861007
on Lyme bacteria _|409822003
in vitro_
;[132] however,
no clinical trials|110465008
of this treatment|276239002|416118004
have
been
carried|288345009
out.|255529000

For early cases,|264499004|398241000|264499004|413769002
prompt treatment|276239002|416118004
is
usually curative.

However,
the severity|272141005
and
treatment|276239002|416118004
of Lyme disease|23502006
may
be
complicated|255302009
due to late diagnosis,|260383002|439401001|260383002
failure|76797004
of antibiotic treatment,|255631004|276239002|255631004|416118004
and
simultaneous infection|79970003
with other tick-borne diseases|74964007|414018003
(coinfections
)
,
including|55919000
ehrlichiosis,|77361002
babesiosis,|21061004
and
immune suppression|86553008
in the patient.|116154003

A meta-analysis|272389005
published
in 2005
found|404684003
some patients|116154003
with Lyme disease|23502006
have
fatigue,|84229001
joint|39352004|81087007|302536002
or
muscle pain,|68962001
and

persisting
for years,|258707000
despite
antibiotic treatment.|255631004|276239002|255631004|416118004

Patients|116154003
with late stage Lyme disease|260383002|21191007|23502006|260383002|371508000|23502006|260383002|261612004|23502006
have
been
shown
to
experience
a level|258395000|276625007
of physical disability equivalent|32572006|9726003|32572006|258726008
to that

in congestive heart failure.[134]|42343007

In dogs,|448771007
a serious long-term prognosis|42745003|20481000
may
result|394617004
in glomerular disease,|197679002
[135]
which
is
a category
of kidney|64033007|17373004|181414000
damage|37782003
that
may
cause|23981006|134198009
chronic kidney disease.|46177005|236425005

Dogs|448771007
may
also
experience
chronic joint disease|27624003|39352004|27624003|81087007|27624003|302536002|90734009|399269003
if
the disease|64572001
is
left|7771000
untreated.|25265005

However,
the majority
of cases|398241000|413769002
of Lyme disease|23502006
in dogs|448771007
result|394617004
in a complete recovery|255594003
with,
and
sometimes
without,
treatment|276239002|416118004
with antibiotics.|255631004

In rare cases,|84638005|398241000|84638005|413769002|103356009|398241000|103356009|413769002
Lyme disease|23502006
can
be
fatal|399166001
to
both
humans|278412004
and
dogs.[137]|448771007

Many patients|260396001|116154003
report|229059009|223458004
a lack|41277001
of understanding|66216009
among employers,|394571004
family,|35359004
and
friends|113163005
as
being
the most frustrating aspect|4757001|224973000
of Lyme disease.|23502006

The fatigue|84229001
that accompanies
it
may
be
perceived|81742003
as malingering,|23268009
especially
after the disease|64572001
enters|417985001
its second|81170007|257997001|288495006
and
third week|70905002|258705008|70905002|259038000

Lyme disease|23502006
is
endemic
in Northern Hemisphere temperate regions.[138][139]|410673009

In northern Africa,|223498002
_B.

burgdorferi
sensu lato_
has
been
identified|7882003
in Morocco,|223513007
Algeria,|223510005
Egypt|223511009
and
Tunisia.[140][141][142]|223514001

Lyme disease|23502006
in sub-Saharan Africa|409988000
is
presently
unknown|261665006
,
but
evidence|18669006
indicates|410535002
it
may
occur|272120004
in humans|278412004
in this region.|410673009

The abundance
of hosts
and
tick vectors|260529001
would
favor
the establishment
of Lyme infection
in Africa.|223498002

In East Africa,|223498002
two cases|420797005|398241000|420797005|413769002
of Lyme disease|23502006
have
been
reported|229059009|223458004
in Kenya.[144]|223534000

_B.

being
found more frequently|404684003|70232002|70232002
in Japan,|223583001

in northwest China,|223581004
Nepal,|223602002

_Borrelia_|112277009|23502006
has
also
been
isolated|46651001
in Mongolia.[147]|223575007

In Australia,|223621005
there
is
definitive evidence|261002007|18669006
for the existence
of endemic _B.

burgdorferi_ infection.

The matter
has
been
controversial
for nearly 20 years|258707000
and
has
been
described
as a local lyme-|255470001
like syndrome
and
sometimes
as Lyme disease.|23502006

Cases|398241000|413769002
of neuroborreliosis
have
been
documented|397934002
in Australia,|223621005
but
are
often|70232002
ascribed to
travel|420008001
to other continents.|74964007|223497007

However,
the author|308004006
of the new study|7147002|110465008|7147002|224699009
states|398070004
it
is
entirely
a neurological disease|118940003
in Australia.[148]|223621005

Owing to changing climate,|243326001|263703002
the range
of ticks able to|371150009|106831000|371150009
carry|288345009
Lyme disease|23502006
has
expanded|70955005
from a limited area|255471002
of Ontario to|224020003

of Saskatchewan|224023001

as far east|223580003
as the island|288560006

A model-based prediction|418836005
by Leighton _
et

(2012
)
suggests
that
the range
of the _I.|42146005|22971001

will
expand|70955005
into Canada|223686002
by 46 km/year|258707000|259039008
over the next decade,|18769003|255260001
with warming climactic temperatures|246508008
as the main driver|63161005|236320001
of increased speed|35105006|260366006
of spread.[155]|410677005

In Europe,|223502009
Lyme disease|23502006
is
caused|23981006|134198009
by infection
with one|421379005

have
been
isolated|46651001
in almost
every country|223369002

Incidence
in southern Europe,|223502009

Portugal,|223675004
is
much lower.[158]|242762006|261122009|4757001|261122009

In the United Kingdom|223860005
the number|410680006|410681005

of Lyme disease|23502006
has
been
rising
steadily since voluntary reporting|255375007|223458004
was
introduced|127487003
in 1986[159]
when
68 cases|264697007|398241000|264697007|413769002
were
recorded
in the UK
and
Republic
of Ireland|223676003
combined.|89780004

In the UK there
were
23 confirmed cases|264657009|59156000|398241000|264657009|59156000|413769002

and
19
in 1990,
[161]
but
973
in 2009[159]
and
953
in 2010.

Provisional figures
for the first 3 quarters|255216001|232714002
of 2011
show
a 26% increase|260366006
on the same period|262126009|259037005
in 2010.[163]

It
is
thought,|88952004
however,
that
the actual number|410680006|410681005
of cases|398241000|413769002
is
significantly higher|75540009|371879000
than
suggested
by the above figures,|261183002
with the UK's Health Protection Agency|263775005|224877003

that there
are
between 2,000|260306008

it
is
believed
that
many GPs|51720005

unaware|418107008|406124004

widespread,|85333001
and

be
found|404684003
in the parks|284589001

A 1989 report|229059009|223458004
found|404684003
that 25%
of forestry workers|34484007

seropositive,|4879001

that
around 2.5%|264655001

in the UK
may
be
infected
,
considerably higher|75540009|371879000
than previously
thought.|88952004

It
is
thought|88952004
that global warming|60132005
may
lead|88488004
to an increase|260366006
in tick activity|48761009|55561003|258745004|257733005
in the future,
as well as
an increase|260366006
in the amount|107651007
of time|410669006
that people|125676002
spend
in public parks,|257677009
thus
increasing|260369004
the risk|30207005
of infection.[176]

In South America,|223504005

Lyme disease|23502006
is
the most common tick-borne disease|4757001|72906007|414018003
in North America|223503004
and
Europe,|223502009
and
one|421379005
of the fastest-growing infectious diseases|16985007|191415002|277748003|191415002
in the United States.|223688001

Of cases|398241000|413769002
reported|229059009|223458004
to the United States CDC,|223688001
the ratio|118586006
of Lyme disease infection|23502006
is
7.9 cases|398241000|413769002
for every 100,000 persons.|125676002

In the ten states|23067006|398070004|420258001|398070004

is
most common,|4757001|72906007

of the disease|64572001
has
been
increasing,|260369004
as
are
endemic regions|410673009
in North America.|223503004

For example,
_B.

burgdorferi
sensu lato_
was
previously
thought|88952004
to
be
hindered
in its ability to|371150009
be
maintained|385630006
in an enzootic cycle|44180009
in California,|224043007|25997004
because
it
was
assumed
the large lizard population|255509001|2773008|385436007|255509001|2773008|389109008
would
dilute|421399004
the prevalence
of _B.

burgdorferi_
in local tick populations|255470001|385436007
;
this
has
since
been
brought|68369002
into question,|42425007
as
some evidence|18669006
has
suggested lizards|2773008
can
become
infected.[186]

Except for one study|421379005|110465008|421379005|224699009
in Europe,|223502009
[187] much
of the data implicating lizards|2773008
is
based|418836005
on DNA detection|24851008
of the spirochete|38732005|115169007|418489004
and
has
not demonstrated lizards|2773008
are
able to|371150009
infect
ticks|106831000
feeding|129007004
upon them.

As some experiments
suggest
lizards|2773008
are
refractory|20646008
to infection
with _Borrelia_,|112277009|23502006
it
appears
likely|2931005
their involvement|248448006
in the enzootic cycle|44180009
is
more complex|242762006|103360007
and
species-specific.[42]|69658003

While
_B.

burgdorferi_
is
most|4757001
associated|47429007
with ticks|106831000
hosted
by white-tailed deer|82978004
and
white-footed mice,|384653004
_Borrelia afzelii_|416551001
is
most frequently|4757001|70232002
detected|260373001
in rodent-feeding vector ticks,|388077003|129007004|260529001|388077003|129007004|260529001|106831000
and
_Borrelia garinii_|113497007
and
_Borrelia valaisiana_|113503004
appear
to
be
associated|47429007
with birds.|387972009

Both
rodents|388077003
and
birds|387972009
are
competent reservoir hosts|32082000|257687008
for _B.

A regionally restricted condition|263856008|260905004
that
may
be
related|272151006|262094002
to Borrelia infection|240668005
is
southern tick-associated rash illness (STARI),|444100007
also
known|36692007
as Masters' disease.|261666007|64572001

Amblyomma americanum,|54089000
known|36692007
commonly
as the lone-star tick,|54089000
is
recognized
as the primary vector|63161005|260529001|261424001|260529001
for STARI.

In some parts|260726005
of the geographical distribution|255464007
of STARI,
Lyme disease|23502006
is
quite rare|84638005|103356009
(
e.g.
,
Arkansas|224042002
)
,
so
patients|116154003
in these regions|410673009
experiencing
Lyme-
like symptoms?especially
if
they
follow|367409002|421939007
a bite|3404009|25272006
from a lone-star tick?|54089000
should
consider
STARI
as a possibility.

It
is
generally
a milder condition|255604002|260905004
than Lyme
and
typically
responds
well|20572008
to antibiotic treatment.|255631004|276239002|255631004|416118004

Although
Montana|224071001
is
the only|50607009|420295001
state|398070004
that
has
not
reported|229059009|223458004
a confirmed case|59156000|398241000

in recent years there|6493001|258707000
have
been
5
to 10 cases|398241000|413769002
a year|258707000|259039008
of a disease|64572001
similar
to Lyme.

It
occurs|272120004
primarily
in pockets
along the Yellowstone River|420531007
in central Montana.|26216008|224071001

People|125676002
have
developed
a red bull's-eye rash|75705005|271807003
around a tick bite|409983009
followed|367409002
by weeks|258705008
of fatigue|84229001
and

The evolutionary history|392521001
of _Borrelia burgdorferi_ genetics|76327009
has
been
the subject
of recent studies.|6493001|110465008|6493001|224699009

One study|421379005|110465008|421379005|224699009
has
found|404684003
that
prior to the reforestation
that
accompanied
post colonial farm abandonment|288563008|224816003
in New England|7147002|223664003
and
the wholesale migration|74118003
into the mid-west|255562008
that
occurred|272120004
during the early 19th century,|264499004
Lyme disease|23502006
was
present|52101004|246105001
for thousands
of years|258707000
in America
and
had
spread|410677005
along
with its tick
hosts
from the Northeast
to the Midwest.[191]

John Josselyn,
who
visited
New England|7147002|223664003
in 1638
and
again
from 1663?1670,
wrote|12261009
"there
be
infinite numbers|410680006|410681005
of tikes
hanging
upon the bushes|112591004
in summer time|410669006
that
will
cleave|227389000|9094003|58604003
to man's garments|248153007|272180002|339947000|272180002|278412004|272180002

into the very flesh|260358002
of a man.|248153007|339947000|278412004

I|42146005|22971001
have
seen
the stockins
of those
that
have
gone
through the woods|14402002|264347000
covered|255334000
with them."[192]

This
is
also
confirmed|59156000
by the writings
of Peter Kalm,
a Swedish botanist|5334003
who
was
sent
to America
by Linnaeus,
and
who
found|404684003
the forests|257616009
of New York "|420278009
abound
"
with ticks|106831000
when
he
visited
in 1749.

When
Kalm's journey
was
retraced
100 years later,|258707000
the forests|257616009
were
gone
and
the Lyme bacterium|409822003
had
probably
become
isolated|46651001
to a few pockets|57176003
along the northeast coast,
Wisconsin,|427726005
and
Minnesota.[193]|224068009

Perhaps
the first detailed description|255216001|232714002
of what
is
now
known|36692007
as Lyme disease|23502006
appeared
in the writings
of Reverend Dr John Walker|309343006|49338004
after a visit
to the Island|288560006
of Jura
(Deer Island|107003000|288560006
)
off the west coast
of Scotland|223678002
in 1764.

He
gives|419582001
a good description|20572008
both
of the symptoms
of Lyme disease|23502006
(
with "exquisite pain [|41226008
in]
the interior parts|260726005
of the limbs"|66019005
)
and
of the tick vector|260529001
itself,
which
he
describes
as a "worm"|27601005|37017009
with a body|279495008|123037004
which
is
"
of a reddish colour|263714004
and
of a compressed shape|37204000|107644003|37204000|246176004|37204000|300842002
with a row
of feet|56459004|259051005
on each side"|182353008
that "
penetrates|53568006
the skin".|119325001|39937001|181469002

Many people|260396001|125676002
from this area|42798000
of Great Britain|223861009
immigrated
to North America|223503004
between 1717
and
the end|261782000|422117008
of the 18th century.

The examination|5880005
of preserved museum specimens|277405005|264370008|123038009
has
found|404684003
_Borrelia_ DNA|112277009|24851008|23502006|24851008
in an infected _Ixodes ricinus_ tick|89126000
from Germany|223637004
that dates|410671006
back
to 1884,
and
from an infected mouse|447612001|447482001
from Cape Cod|228230007|260174003

died|419620001|419099009

Poland|223640004
(then
known|36692007
as Breslau,
Free State|37837009|398070004
of Prussia,
where physician Alfred Buchwald|309343006
described
a man|248153007|339947000|278412004
who
had
suffered
for 16 years|258707000
with a degenerative skin disorder now|396325007
known|36692007
as acrodermatitis chronica atrophicans.[197]|4340003

At a 1909 research conference,
Swedish dermatologist Arvid Afzelius|18803008
presented|246105001
a study|110465008|224699009
about an expanding,|70955005
ring-like lesion|112627000|257380004
he
had
observed
in an older woman|70753007|224526002
following|255260001
the bite|3404009|25272006
of a sheep tick.|89126000

He
named|27468005
the lesion _erythema migrans_.|59032001

The skin condition now|422000003
known|36692007
as borrelial lymphocytoma|112277009|19750001|23502006|19750001
was
first|255216001|232714002
described
in 1911.[198]

Neurological problems|299960009
following|255260001
tick bites|409983009
were
recognized
starting|255395001|385652002
in the 1920s.

French physicians Garin|19434008|309343006
and
Bujadoux
described
a farmer|106388008
with a painful sensory radiculitis|82473003
accompanied
by mild meningitis|255604002|7180009
following|255260001
a tick bite.|409983009

A large, ring-shaped rash|255509001|112627000|271807003
was
also
noted
,
although
the doctors|309343006
did
not
relate|272151006|262094002
it
to the meningoradiculitis.

In 1930,
the Swedish dermatologist Sven Hellerstr?m|18803008
was
the first to|255216001|232714002
propose
EM
and
neurological symptoms|267070008
following|255260001
a tick bite|409983009
were
related.|272151006|262094002

In the 1940s,
German neurologist Alfred Bannwarth|7695005|56397003
described
several cases|261028005|398241000|261028005|413769002
of chronic lymphocytic meningitis|230154004
and
polyradiculoneuritis,
some
of which
were
accompanied
by erythematous skin lesions.|444827008|95324001

Carl Lennhoff,
who
worked|261041009
at the Karolinska Institute|385437003
in Sweden,|223681007
believed
many skin conditions|95320005
were
caused|23981006|134198009
by spirochetes.|115169007|419328001|418489004

In 1948,
he
used|394850002
a special stain to microscopically|67995009|397165007|67995009|127790008
observe
what he
believed
were
spirochetes|115169007|419328001|418489004
in various types|256220008|261664005
of skin lesions,|95324001
including|55919000
EM.

Although
his conclusions
were
later
shown to
be
erroneous, interest|225469004
in the study|110465008|224699009
of spirochetes|115169007|419328001|418489004
was
sparked.

In 1949,
Nils Thyresson,|260386005
who also
worked|261041009
at the Karolinska Institute,|385437003
was
the first to|255216001|232714002
treat|395077000
ACA|60176003
with penicillin.|373270004

In the 1950s,
the relationship|272151006
among tick bite,|409983009
lymphocytoma,|19750001
EM
and
Bannwarth's syndrome|48982009
was
recognized
throughout Europe|223502009
leading|236874000
to the widespread use|85333001|277889008|85333001|419385000
of penicillin|373270004
for treatment|276239002|416118004
in Europe.[202][203]|223502009

In 1970,
a dermatologist|18803008
in Wisconsin|427726005
named|27468005
Rudolph Scrimenti
recognized
an EM lesion
in a patient|116154003
after recalling
a paper|50833004
by Hellerstr?m
that
had
been
reprinted
in an American science
journal|433497004
in 1950.

This
was
the first documented case|255216001|397934002|398241000|232714002|397934002|398241000
of EM
in the United States.|223688001

Based|418836005
on the European literature,|414152003
he
treated|28995006
the patient|116154003
with penicillin.[204]|373270004

The full syndrome now|261015003
known|36692007
as Lyme disease|23502006
was
not
recognized
until a cluster
of cases originally|398241000|413769002
thought|88952004
to
be
juvenile rheumatoid arthritis|410796000
was
identified|7882003
in three towns|421291004|288521009
in southeastern Connecticut|224045000
in 1975,
including|55919000
the towns Lyme|288521009
and
Old Lyme,|70753007
which
gave|419582001
the disease|64572001
its popular name.

This
was
investigated|116698004
by physicians David Snydman|309343006
and
Allen Steere
of the Epidemic Intelligence Service,|22851009|224930009
and
by others|74964007
from Yale University.|224871002

The recognition|312020002
that
the patients|116154003
in the United States|223688001
had
EM
led|88488004|236874000
to the recognition|312020002
that "Lyme arthritis"|33937009
was
one manifestation|421379005|250255003|421379005|251190009
of the same tick-borne condition|262126009|106970005|260905004|262126009|81827009|260905004|262126009|398209006|260905004
known|36692007
in Europe.[206]|223502009

Before 1976,
elements|57795002
of _B.

burgdorferi sensu lato_ infection
were
called
or
known|36692007
as tick-borne meningopolyneuritis,|48982009
Garin-Bujadoux syndrome,
Bannwarth syndrome,|48982009
Afzelius' disease,|64572001
[207] Montauk Knee|304679005|49076000|361291001|72696002
or
sheep tick fever.|89126000|386661006|388254009|13906002|388254009|388254009|83937008|255392003|13906002|255392003|255392003|83937008

Since 1976
the disease|64572001
is
most often|4757001|70232002
referred to|439980006
as
Lyme disease,|23502006
[208][209] Lyme borreliosis|23502006
or
simply borreliosis.|240668005

In 1980,
Steere,
_
et
al._,
began|255395001
to
test|269814003|272393004
antibiotic regimens|255631004
in adult patients|133936004|116154003
with Lyme disease.|23502006

In the same year,|262126009|258707000|262126009|259039008
New York State Health Dept.|420278009|398070004|263775005

epidemiologist Jorge Benach
provided
Willy Burgdorfer,
a researcher
at the Rocky Mountain Biological Laboratory,|257644005|12893009|261904005
with collections
of _I.|42146005|22971001

dammini_ [_scapularis_]
from Shelter Island,|288560006
NY,|420278009
a known Lyme-endemic area|36692007|42798000
as part|260726005
of an ongoing investigation|255238004|386053000
of Rocky Mountain spotted fever.|186772009

In examining|64049009
the ticks|106831000
for rickettsiae,|62065006|115178001
Burgdorfer noticed "poorly|556001
stained,|397165007|127790008
rather long, irregularly coiled spirochetes."|255511005|261363007|115169007|255511005|261363007|255511005|261363007|419328001|255511005|261363007|418489004
Further examination revealed spirochetes|46053002|5880005|263857004|115169007|46053002|5880005|263857004|46053002|5880005|263857004|419328001|46053002|5880005|263857004|418489004
in 60%
of the ticks.|106831000

Burgdorfer
credited
his familiarity|36692007
with the European literature|414152003
for his realization
that
the spirochetes|115169007|419328001|418489004
might
be
the "long-sought cause|255511005|134198009
of ECM
and
Lyme disease."|23502006
Benach
supplied|425398004
him
with more|242762006
ticks|106831000
from Shelter Island|288560006
and
sera|67922002
from patients|116154003
diagnosed|439401001
with Lyme disease.|23502006

University of Texas Health Science Center researcher Alan Barbour "|224871002|421662006|264361005
offered|410527000
his expertise
to culture|252398009|61594008
and
immunochemically
characterize
the organism."|410653004
Burgdorfer subsequently
confirmed|59156000
his discovery
by isolating|46651001
from patients|116154003
with Lyme disease|23502006
spirochetes|115169007|419328001|418489004
identical|20323000
to those
found|404684003
in ticks.|106831000

In June 1982,
he
published
his findings|404684003
in Science,
and
the spirochete|38732005|115169007|418489004
was
named|27468005
_Borrelia burgdorferi_|76327009
in his honor.[212]

After the identification|286672002|7882003
of _B.

burgdorferi_
as the causative agent|362944004
of Lyme disease,|23502006
antibiotics|255631004
were
selected
for testing,|272393004
guided|106384005|303479009
by _
in vitro_ antibiotic sensitivities,|255631004|365705006
including|55919000
tetracycline antibiotics,|282831004
amoxicillin,|372687004
cefuroxime axetil,|89678001
intravenous|255560000
and
intramuscular penicillin|76601001|373270004|76601001|255559005|373270004|255559005
and
intravenous ceftriaxone.|372670001|255560000|372670001

The mechanism|257544000
of tick transmission|258150004
was
also
the subject
of much discussion.|223482009

_B.

burgdorferi_ spirochetes|115169007|419328001|418489004
were
identified|7882003
in tick saliva|256897009
in 1987,
confirming|59156000
the hypothesis
that transmission|258150004
occurred|272120004
via tick salivary glands.[215]|75535001

Jonathan Edlow,
Professor
of Medicine|410942007
at Harvard Medical School,|74188005|257698009
quotes
the late Ed Masters|260383002|397803000|261666007|260383002|225728007|261666007
(discoverer
of STARI,
a Lyme-
like illness|39104002
)
in his book _Bull's-Eye_,|278212002|81745001|278212002|244486005
on the history|392521001
of Lyme disease.|23502006

Edlow writes|12261009
:

Urbanization
and
other anthropogenic factors|74964007
can
be
implicated
in the
spread|410677005
of Lyme disease|23502006
to humans.|278412004

In many areas,|42798000
expansion
of suburban neighborhoods
has
led|88488004|236874000
to gradual deforestation|255343009
of surrounding wooded areas|355648006|272500005
and
increased border contact|35105006|112233002|11723008|35105006|112233002|70862002|260366006|112233002|11723008|260366006|112233002|70862002
between humans|278412004
and
tick-dense areas.|255596001|42798000

Human expansion|278412004
has
also
resulted|42752001|394617004
in reduction|58294000|260400001|289928003
of predators
that hunt deer|107003000
as well as
mice,|447612001|447482001
chipmunks|392596000
and
other small rodents ?|74964007|255507004|388077003
the primary reservoirs|63161005|257687008|261424001|257687008
for Lyme disease.|23502006

As a consequence|103332005
of increased human contact|35105006|278412004|11723008|35105006|278412004|70862002|260366006|278412004|11723008|260366006|278412004|70862002
with host
and
vector,|260529001
the likelihood|2931005
of transmission|258150004
of the disease|64572001
has
greatly
increased.|35105006|260366006

Researchers
are
investigating|116698004
possible links|371930009|60022001
between global warming|60132005
and
the
spread|410677005
of vector-borne diseases,|418833002
including|55919000
Lyme disease.[219]|23502006

The deer tick|76387006
(_Ixodes scapularis_,|76387006
the primary vector|63161005|260529001|261424001|260529001
in the northeastern U.S.|223688001
)
has
a two-year life cycle,|420797005|258707000|224130005|44180009|420797005|259039008|224130005|44180009
first|255216001|232714002
progressing|255314001
from larva
to nymph,|362240001
and
then
from nymph|362240001
to adult.|133936004

The tick feeds only|129007004
once
at each stage.|21191007|371508000|261612004

In the fall,|1912002
large acorn|255509001|261273007
forests|257616009
attract deer,|107003000
as well as
mice,|447612001|447482001
chipmunks|392596000
and
other small rodents|74964007|255507004|388077003
infected
with _B.

burgdorferi_.

During the following spring,|255260001
the ticks|106831000
lay|40199007|255576009
their eggs.|102263004

The rodent population then "|388077003|385436007|388077003|389109008
booms
".

Tick eggs hatch|102263004
into larvae,
which
feed|129007004
on the rodents|388077003
;
thus
the larvae
acquire|255396000
infection
from the rodents.|388077003

At this stage,|21191007|371508000|261612004
tick infestation|17322007|33042004
may
be
controlled|31509003
using|260676000
acaricides|24686008
(miticides.|24686008

Adult ticks|133936004|133936004|106831000
may
also
transmit|60117003
disease|64572001
to humans.|278412004

After feeding,|129007004
female adult ticks|248152002|133936004|248152002|133936004|106831000|224526002|133936004|224526002|133936004|106831000
lay|40199007|255576009
their eggs|102263004
on the ground,
and
the cycle|44180009
is
complete.|255594003

On the West Coast
of the United States,|223688001
Lyme disease|23502006
is
spread|410677005
by the western black-legged tick|76387006
(_Ixodes pacificus_|592002
)
,
which
has
a different life cycle.|263735002|224130005|44180009

The risk|30207005
of acquiring Lyme disease|255396000|23502006
does
not
depend
on the existence
of a local deer population,|255470001|107003000|385436007|255470001|107003000|389109008
as is commonly
assumed.

New research|7147002
suggests
eliminating deer|107003000
from smaller areas|263796003|42798000|255507004|42798000
(less
than 2.5 ha|264655001
or
6 acres|282386006
may
in fact
lead|88488004
to an increase|260366006
in tick density|125146005
and
the rise
of "tick-borne disease|414018003

The term "chronic Lyme disease"|27624003
or
"
post-Lyme disease syndrome"|23502006
is
not
recognized
in the medical literature,|74188005
[235]
and
most medical authorities|74188005
advise|424900004
against long-term antibiotic treatment|255631004|276239002|255631004|416118004
for chronic Lyme disease,|27624003
[83][236][237] however,
The Center for Disease Control|26216008|64572001|31509003
does
state|398070004
that "approximately 10|26175008
to 20%
of patients|116154003
treated|28995006
for Lyme disease|23502006
with a recommended 2-4 week course|258705008|288524001|259038000|288524001
of antibiotics|255631004
will
have
lingering symptoms
of fatigue,|84229001
pain,|22253000
or
joint|39352004|81087007|302536002
and
muscle aches.|68962001

In some cases,|398241000|413769002
these
can
last
for more
than 6 months.|258706009

Although
often|70232002
called 'chronic Lyme disease,|27624003
'
this condition|260905004
is
properly
known|36692007
as 'Post-treatment Lyme disease Syndrome' (PTLDS)".|288563008|276239002|23502006|288563008|416118004|23502006

(http

//www.cdc.gov/lyme/postLDS/index.html|419205000
The term
is
often|70232002
applied|410618006
to several different sets|261028005|263735002
of patients.|116154003

One usage refers|421379005|277889008|439980006
to people|125676002
suffering
from the symptoms
of untreated|25265005
and
disseminated|65709003
late-stage Lyme disease|260383002|21191007|23502006|260383002|371508000|23502006|260383002|261612004|23502006
:
arthritis,|3723001
peripheral neuropathy|42658009
and/or
encephalomyelitis.|62950007

The term
is
also
applied|410618006
to people|125676002
who
have
had
the disease|64572001
in the past|410513005
and
some symptoms
remain
after antibiotic treatment,|255631004|276239002|255631004|416118004
which
is
also
called
post-Lyme disease syndrome.|23502006

A third|70905002
and
controversial use|277889008|419385000
of the term applies|410618006|417924000
to patients|116154003
with nonspecific symptoms,|10003008
such as fatigue,|84229001
who
show
no objective evidence|410518001|18669006|260224007|18669006
they
have
been
infected
with Lyme disease|23502006
in the past,|410513005
since
the standard diagnostic tests|103693007
for infection
are
negative.[6][235]|260385009

Up to one third|421379005|70905002
of Lyme disease patients|23502006|116154003
who
have
completed|255594003
a course|288524001
of antibiotic treatment|255631004|276239002|255631004|416118004
continue|255238004
to
have
symptoms,
such as severe fatigue,|24484000|84229001
sleep disturbance,|53888004|44186003
unconsciousness,|418107008
and
cognitive difficulties,|371157007
with these symptoms
being
severe|24484000
in about 2%
of cases.|398241000|413769002

While
it
is
undisputed
these patients|116154003
can
have
severe symptoms,|162470006
the cause|134198009
and
appropriate treatment|276239002|416118004
is
controversial.

The symptoms
may
represent
"
for all intents|363675004
and
purposes" fibromyalgia|363675004|203102006
or
chronic fatigue syndrome.|51771007

A few doctors|57176003|309343006
attribute|246061005
these symptoms
to persistent infection|115648009
with _Borrelia_,|112277009|23502006
or
coinfections
with other tick-borne infections,|74964007|106970005|74964007|81827009|74964007|398209006
such as _Ehrlichia_|27334000
and
_Babesia_.|35029001

Other doctors|74964007|309343006
believe
that
the initial infection|884001|232714002
may
cause|23981006|134198009
an autoimmune reaction|263680009
that
continues|255238004
to
cause|23981006|134198009
serious symptoms even|42745003
after the bacteria|409822003
have
been
eliminated
by antibiotics.[72]|255631004

A review
looked|386548000
at several animal studies|261028005|387961004|110465008|261028005|387961004|224699009
that found persistence|404684003|130965009|130965009
of live|419749002
but
disabled spirochetes|115169007|419328001|418489004
following|255260001
treatment|276239002|416118004
of _B.

burgdorferi_ infection
with antibiotics.|255631004

The authors|308004006
noted
that none|260413007
of the lingering spirochetes|115169007|419328001|418489004
were
associated|47429007
with inflamed tissues|85756007
and
criticized
the studies|110465008|224699009
for
not
considering
adequately
the different pharmacodynamics|263735002
and
pharmacokinetics
of the antibiotics|255631004
used|394850002
to
treat|395077000
the animals|387961004
in the trials|110465008
versus
what
would
be
expected
to
be
used|394850002
to
treat|395077000
humans.|278412004

The authors|308004006
concluded
,
"There
is
no scientific evidence to|18669006
support|9096001|243114000
the hypothesis
that
such spirochetes,|115169007|419328001|418489004
should
they
exist
in humans,|278412004
are
the cause|134198009
of post-Lyme disease syndrome."|288563008|23502006

An advocacy group|372038002|261586004|372038002|160481000|372038002|389109008
called
the International Lyme And Associated Diseases Society (ILADS)[243]|23502006|47429007
argues
the persistence|130965009
of B.

may
be
responsible|394851003
for manifestations|250255003|251190009
of late Lyme disease symptoms.|260383002|23502006

It
has
questioned
the generalizability
and

of some
of the above trials|261183002|110465008

the reliability
of the current diagnostic tests.|15240007|103693007

Major|255603008
US medical authorities,|74188005

the Infectious Diseases Society|191415002
of America,
the American Academy of Neurology,|394591006
and
the National Institutes of Health,|385437003|263775005
have
stated|398070004
there
is
no convincing evidence|18669006
that _Borrelia_|112277009|23502006
is
involved|248448006
in the various symptoms|256220008
classed|258391009
as chronic Lyme disease,|27624003
and
advise|424900004
against long-term antibiotic treatment|255631004|276239002|255631004|416118004
as ineffective
and
possibly harmful.|60022001

Prolonged antibiotic therapy|255224006|281789004
presents|52101004|246105001
significant risks|386134007|30207005
and
can
have
dangerous side effects.

One death|421379005|419620001|421379005|268923008
has
been
reported|229059009|223458004
from an infected catheter|19923001
as a complication|116223007|263718001
of a 27-month course|258706009|288524001|259036001|288524001
of intravenous antibiotics|255631004|255560000|255631004
for an unsubstantiated diagnosis|439401001
of chronic Lyme disease.[247]|27624003

Antibiotic treatment|255631004|276239002|255631004|416118004
is
the central pillar|26216008
in the management|413454004|119270007
of Lyme disease.|23502006

However,
in the late stages|260383002|261612004
of borreliosis,|240668005
symptoms
may
persist
despite extensive|41118005
and
repeated antibiotic treatment.|27582007|255631004|276239002|27582007|255631004|416118004

Although
these chronic symptoms|90734009
are
possibly|60022001
due to
either
autoimmunity|4301008
or
residual bacteria|65320000|409822003
(
see|281004000

after antibiotic treatment,|255631004|276239002|255631004|416118004
which
suggests
the arthritis|3723001

continue|255238004

not
recommended
for any stage|21191007|371508000|261612004
of Lyme arthritis.[250]|33937009

Patients|116154003
with chronic neuropathic pain|90734009|247398009
responded
well|20572008
to gabapentin monotherapy|386845007
with residual pain|65320000|22253000
after intravenous ceftriaxone treatment|372670001|276239002|372670001|416118004|255560000|372670001|276239002|255560000|372670001|416118004
in a pilot study.|308040008|110465008|308040008|224699009

Some antibiotics|255631004
may
have
a dual effect|253861007
on Lyme disease,|23502006
since
minocycline|372653009
and
doxycycline|372478003
have
anti-inflammatory effects|330901000|253861007
in addition|260364009
to their antibiotic actions,|255631004|129264002
including|55919000
anti-inflammatory effects|330901000|253861007
specific|69658003
to the inflammation|257552002
caused|23981006|134198009
by Lyme disease.|23502006

Indeed,
minocycline|372653009
has
been
suggested
for other neurodegenerative|74964007
and
inflammatory disorders,|128139000
such as multiple sclerosis,|24700007
Parkinson's disease,|49049000
Huntington's disease,|58756001
rheumatoid arthritis|69896004
and
ALS.[254]

While
there
is
general agreement|60132005
on the optimal treatment|276239002|416118004
for early Lyme disease,|264499004|23502006
there
is
considerable controversy
over the existence,
prevalence,
diagnostic criteria,|439401001|261004008
and
treatment|276239002|416118004
of "chronic" Lyme disease.|27624003

The evidence-based perspective|18669006|18669006|418836005
is
exemplified
by a 2007 review
in _
The New England Journal|7147002|223664003
of Medicine,|410942007
_
which
noted
the diagnosis|439401001
of chronic Lyme disease|27624003
is
used|394850002
by a few physicians|57176003|309343006
despite a lack|41277001
of "reproducible
or
convincing scientific evidence",|18669006
leading|236874000
the authors to|308004006
describe
this diagnosis|439401001
as "
the latest|260383002
in a series|13039001
of syndromes
that
have
been
postulated
in an attempt to
attribute|246061005
medically unexplained symptoms
to particular infections."[235] Most medical authorities|74188005
agree
with this viewpoint
:
the IDSA,
the American Academy of Neurology,|394591006
the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|26216008|64572001|31509003|169443000
(CDC
)
,
and
the NIH advise|424900004
against long-term antibiotic treatment|255631004|276239002|255631004|416118004
for chronic Lyme disease,|27624003
given|419582001
the lack|41277001
of supporting evidence|9096001|18669006|243114000|18669006
and
the potential toxicities.[83][236][237]|30207005

A minority view|410599005|246516004|255606000|246516004
holds|421139008
that chronic Lyme disease|27624003
is
responsible|394851003
for a range
of unexplained symptoms,
sometimes
in people|125676002
without any evidence|18669006
of past infection.|410513005

This viewpoint
is
promoted
by many patient advocates,|116154003
notably
an advocacy organization,|372038002|21139007
[243]
the International Lyme
And
Associated Diseases Society.|47429007|64572001

Groups|261586004|160481000
of patients,|116154003
patient advocates,|116154003
and
the small number|255507004|410680006|255507004|410681005
of physicians|309343006
who
support|9096001|243114000
the concept
of chronic Lyme disease|27624003
have
organized|385650005
to lobby
for recognition|312020002
of this diagnosis,|439401001
as well as
to
argue
for insurance coverage
of long-term antibiotic therapy,|281789004
which
most
insurers
deny,|441889009
as
it
is
at odds
with the guidelines
of major medical organizations.[255][256]|255603008|74188005|21139007

In 2006,
Richard Blumenthal,
the Connecticut Attorney General,|224045000|12877000|60132005
opened|56116003
an antitrust investigation|386053000
against the IDSA,
accusing
the IDSA Lyme disease panel|23502006|261586004
of undisclosed conflicts of interest|15863006|225469004
and
of unduly
dismissing
alternative therapies|276239002
and
chronic Lyme disease.|27624003

The investigation|386053000
was
closed|29179001
on May 1,
2008,
without charges
when
the IDSA
agreed
to
submit
to a review
of its guidelines
by a panel|261586004
of independent scientists|371153006|308027003
and
physicians|309343006
which
would
occur|272120004
on July 30,
2009.

Views|246516004
on the motivation|106121005
and
outcome|394617004
of the investigation|386053000
varied.

Blumenthal's press release|58000006|68776005|258760001|129299003|115956009
described
the agreement
as a vindication
of his investigation|386053000
and
repeated|27582007
his conflict-of-interest allegations.[258]|15863006|225469004

The IDSA
focused|87017008|363702006
on the fact
that
the medical validity|74188005
of the IDSA guidelines
was
not
challenged
,
[259]
and
cited
mounting|246143003
legal costs|398165009
and
the difficulty|371157007
of presenting scientific arguments|246105001|9182005
in a legal setting|398165009
as their rationale|410666004
for accepting|385645004
the settlement.

A journalist writing|308004006|12261009
in _Nature Medicine_|277302009|410942007
suggested
some IDSA members|394852005
may
not
have
disclosed potential conflicts of interest,|30207005|15863006|225469004
[255]
while
a _Forbes_ piece
described
Blumenthal's investigation|386053000
as "intimidation"|279497000
of scientists|308027003
by an elected official
with close ties|29179001|228197000
to Lyme advocacy groups.|372038002|261586004|372038002|160481000

The _Journal
of the American Medical Association_|74188005|263534001|74188005|272151006
described
the decision
as an example
of the "politicization
of health policy"|263775005
that
went
against the weight|27113001|272102008|39857003

and
may
have
a chilling effect|43724002|253861007
on future decisions
by medical associations.[261]|74188005|263534001

The state|398070004

New Hampshire[266]|421753003

The expert panel's review|261586004
was
published
in 2010,
with the independent doctors|303134001
and
scientists|308027003
in the panel unanimously|261586004
endorsing
the guidelines,
stating|398070004
"
No changes|243326001|263703002
or
revisions|272129003
to the 2006 Lyme guidelines
are
necessary

and
concluding long-term antibiotic treatments|255631004|276239002

unproven|277026000

potentially dangerous.

The IDSA
welcomed
the final report,|445665009
stating|398070004
that "
Our number one concern|410680006|421379005|410681005|421379005
is
the patients|116154003
we
treat|395077000
,
and
we
're
glad patients|116154003
and
their physicians now|309343006
have
additional reassurance|260364009|79441000
that
the guidelines
are
medically sound."[269]|68325009

The campaign
of Mitt Romney
and
Paul Ryan
favored
a law
that
would
provide
"physicians|309343006
with protection
from lawsuits to
ensure
they
can
treat|395077000
the disease|64572001
with the aggressive antibiotics|61372001|255631004|255631004
that
are
required."

In 2001,
_
The New York|420278009
Times Magazine_
reported|229059009|223458004
that Allen Steere,
chief
of immunology|37523008

rheumatology|394810000|45440000
at Tufts Medical Center|288565001

a co-discoverer

at his refusal to
substantiate
their diagnoses|439401001
of "chronic" Lyme disease|27624003

endorse long-term antibiotic therapy.|281789004

Because
this intimidation|279497000

cited
the political controversy
and
high emotions|75540009|285854004|371879000|285854004
as contributing
to a "poisonous atmosphere"|35331000|304607008
around Lyme disease,|23502006
which
he
believes
has
led|88488004|236874000
to doctors|309343006
trying
to
avoid
having
Lyme patients|116154003
in their practices.[257]
