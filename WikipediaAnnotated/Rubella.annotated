[1]|260305007
is
a disease|64572001
caused|23981006|134198009
by the rubella virus.|5210005

The name "rubella"|36653000
is
derived
from Latin,
meaning|255586005
_little red_.|281411007|386713009|281411007|371240000|255507004|386713009|255507004|371240000

Rubella|36653000
is
also
known|36692007
as German measles|36653000
because
the disease|64572001
was
first|255216001|232714002
described
by German physicians|7695005|309343006
in the mid-eighteenth century.|255562008

This disease|64572001
is
often mild|70232002|255604002
and
attacks|216299002
often|70232002
pass
unnoticed.

The disease|64572001
can
last
one|421379005
to three days.|421291004|258703001

Children|410601007|160499008
recover|74822006
more quickly|242762006
than adults.|133936004

Infection
of the mother|72705000
by Rubella virus|5210005
during pregnancy|289908002
can
be
serious|42745003
;
if
the mother|72705000
is
infected
within the first 20 weeks|255216001|258705008|232714002|258705008
of pregnancy,|289908002
the child|410601007|160499008
may
be
born|106970005|81827009|398209006
with congenital rubella syndrome (CRS),|1857005
which
entails
a range
of serious incurable illnesses.|42745003|39104002

Spontaneous abortion|17369002
occurs|272120004
in
up to 20%
of cases.[2]|398241000|413769002

Rubella|36653000
is
a common childhood infection usually|72906007|68433009
with minimal systemic upset|255605001|31099001|224977004|255604002|31099001|224977004
although
transient arthropathy|66191007
may
occur|272120004
in adults.|133936004

Serious complications|42745003|116223007
are
very rare.|260358002|84638005|260358002|103356009

Apart from the effects|253861007
of transplacental infection|260607005
on the developing fetus,|83418008
rubella|36653000
is
a relatively trivial infection.

Acquired|255396000
(i.e.|42146005|22971001

not congenital|6160004|255399007
)
rubella|36653000
is
transmitted|60117003|258150004
via airborne droplet emission|81059003
from the upper respiratory tract|58675001|361381009
of active cases|55561003|398241000|55561003|413769002
(
can
be
passed
along
by the breath|11891009
of people sick|125676002
from Rubella|36653000
).

The virus|49872002
may
also
be
present|52101004|246105001
in the urine,|78014005
feces|39477002
and
on the skin.|119325001|39937001|181469002

There
is
no carrier state|29679002
:
the reservoir|257687008
exists
entirely in active human cases.|55561003|278412004|398241000|55561003|278412004|413769002

The disease|64572001
has
an incubation period|406646006
of 2|260306008
to 3 weeks.|260313008|258705008

In most people|125676002
the virus|49872002
is
rapidly|418694008
eliminated.

However,
it
may
persist
for some months|258706009
post partum|255410009
in infants|418119000
surviving
the CRS.|57219006

These children|410601007|160499008
are
a significant source|386134007|260753009
of infection
to other infants|74964007|418119000
and
,
more importantly,|242762006
to pregnant female contacts.|255409004|11723008|255409004|70862002

The name _rubella_|36653000
is
sometimes
confused|286933003
with _rubeola_,|14189004
an alternative name
for measles|14189004
in English-speaking countries|297487008|87335007|223369002|25804004|87335007|223369002
;
the diseases|64572001
are
unrelated.|262241003

In some other European languages,|74964007|414152003|61909002|74964007|61909002
like Spanish,
_rubella_|36653000
and
_rubeola_|14189004
are
synonyms,
and
_rubeola_|14189004
is
not
an alternative name
for measles.[6]|14189004

After an incubation period|406646006
of 14?21 days,|258703001
German measles|36653000
causes|134198009
symptoms
that
are
similar
to the flu.|6142004

The primary symptom|63161005|261424001
of rubella virus infection|5210005|36653000|34014006
is
the appearance|386548000|255412001
of a rash|271807003
(exanthem|271807003
)
on the face|89545001|302549007
which
spreads|410677005
to the trunk|22943007|262225004
and
limbs|66019005
and
usually
fades
after three days|421291004|258703001
(
that
is
why
it
is
often|70232002
referred to|439980006
as
three-day measles|36653000
).

The facial rash usually|89545001|271807003
clears|84989007|263707001
as
it
spreads|410677005
to other parts|74964007|260726005
of the body.|279495008|123037004

Other symptoms|74964007
include|55919000
low grade fever,|304213008
swollen glands|30746006
(sub occipital & posterior cervical lymphadenopathy|261089000|127076002|255551008|261064006|118555000|127076002|255551008|261064006
)
,
joint pains,|57676002
headache|25064002
and
conjunctivitis.[7]|9826008

The swollen glands|30746006
or
lymph nodes|59441001
can
persist
for
up to a week|258705008|259038000
and
the fever rarely|386661006|103356009
rises
above 38 oC|264670000
(100.4
oF
).

The rash|271807003
of German measles|36653000
is
typically pink|371243003
or
light red.|285330001

The rash|271807003
causes|134198009
itching|424492005
and
often lasts|70232002
for about three days.|421291004|258703001

The rash|271807003
disappears
after a few days|57176003|258703001
with no staining|127790008
or
peeling|257890000|51979000
of the skin.|119325001|39937001|181469002

When
the rash|271807003
clears|84989007|263707001
up,
the skin|119325001|39937001|181469002
might
shed
in very small flakes|260358002|255507004
where the rash|271807003
covered|255334000
it.

Forchheimer's sign|72670004
occurs|272120004
in 20%
of cases,|398241000|413769002
and
is
characterized
by small, red papules|255507004|386713009|443871003|255507004|371240000|443871003
on the area|42798000
of the soft palate.|49460000|245784004

Rubella|36653000
can
affect|4065008
anyone
of any age|424144002
and
is
generally
a mild disease,|255604002|64572001
rare|84638005|103356009
in infants|418119000
or
those over|21481007
the age|424144002
of 40.|259031006

The older|70753007
the person|125676002
is
the more severe|242762006|24484000
the symptoms
are
likely to|2931005
be.

Up to two-thirds|420797005|70905002
of older girls|70753007|431549007
or
women|224526002
experience
joint pain|57676002
or
arthritic type symptoms|261664005
with rubella.|36653000

The virus|49872002
is
contracted|78558002
through the respiratory tract|20139000|321667001|361110005
and
has
an incubation period|406646006
of 2|260306008
to 3 weeks.|260313008|258705008

During this incubation period,|406646006
the patient|116154003
is
contagious typically
for about one week|421379005|258705008|421379005|259038000
before
he/
she
develops
a rash|271807003
and
for about one week thereafter.|421379005|258705008|421379005|259038000

Rubella|36653000
can
cause|23981006|134198009
congenital rubella syndrome|1857005
in the newly
born.|106970005|81827009|398209006

The syndrome
(CRS|57219006
)
follows|367409002
intrauterine infection|398236008
by the Rubella virus|5210005
and
comprises
cardiac, cerebral, ophthalmic|80891009
and
auditory defects.|128540005

It
may
also
cause|23981006|134198009
prematurity,|44247006
low birth weight,|276610007
and
neonatal thrombocytopenia,|82835005|240305000
anaemia|271737000
and
hepatitis.|128241005|40468003|396423004

The risk|30207005
of major defects|255603008|6920004
or
organogenesis
is
highest|75540009|371879000
for infection
in the first trimester.|255246003

CRS|57219006
is
the main|63161005
reason|410666004
a vaccine|398827000
for rubella|36653000
was
developed.[9]

Many mothers|260396001|72705000
who
contract|78558002
rubella|36653000
within the first critical trimester|255246003
either
have
a miscarriage|17369002
or
a still born baby.|106970005|418119000|81827009|418119000|398209006|418119000

If
the baby|418119000
survives
the infection,
it
can
be
born|106970005|81827009|398209006
with severe heart disorders|24484000|56265001
(Patent ductus arteriosus|83330001
being
the most common|4757001|72906007
)
,
blindness,
deafness,|343087000|8531006
or
other life threatening organ disorders.|74964007|224130005|410653004|64572001

The skin manifestations|119325001|250255003|119325001|251190009|39937001|250255003|39937001|251190009|181469002|250255003|181469002|251190009
are
called
"blueberry muffin|412061001|226704004
lesions
".

[9]
For these reasons,|410666004
Rubella|36653000
is
included|55919000
on the TORCH complex|41679006|103360007
of perinatal infections.|206331005

The disease|64572001
is
caused|23981006|134198009
by Rubella virus,|5210005
a togavirus|129231002
that
is
enveloped
and
has
a single-stranded RNA genome.|125681006|27888000|18470003|50607009|27888000|18470003

The virus|49872002
is
transmitted|60117003|258150004
by the respiratory route|258162000|284009009|258162000|449071006|284009009|449071006
and
replicates|1305003
in the nasopharynx|264105008|181200003
and
lymph nodes.|59441001

The virus|49872002
is
found|404684003
in the blood 5|87612001|119273009
to 7 days|258703001
after infection
and
spreads|410677005
throughout the body.|279495008|123037004

The virus|49872002
has
teratogenic properties|45986006|370130000|45986006|116685008|58694006|370130000|58694006|116685008
and
is
capable
of crossing
the placenta|62669004|181455002
and
infecting
the fetus|83418008
where it
stops|260890000
cells|4421005
from developing
or
destroys
them.[7]

Increased susceptibility|35105006|76522002|35105006|118588007|260366006|76522002|260366006|118588007
to infection
might
be
inherited|255404009
as
there
is
some indication|410666004
that HLA-A1|37287005
or
factors
surrounding|355648006
A1
on extended haplotypes|255536004|288467006|255590007
are
involved|248448006
in virus infection|34014006
or
non-resolution
of the disease.|64572001

[12]

Rubella virus specific IgM antibodies|120737006|69658003
are
present|52101004|246105001
in people recently|125676002|6493001
infected
by Rubella virus|5210005
but
these antibodies|68498002
can
persist
for over|21481007
a year|258707000|259039008
and
a positive test result|258758003|277775005|258758003|118246004|10828004|277775005|10828004|118246004
needs|410525008|103325001
to
be
interpreted|363714003
with caution.

The presence|386397008
of these antibodies|68498002
along
with,
or
a short time|359530003|410669006|367450005|410669006
after,
the characteristic rash|271807003
confirms|59156000
the diagnosis.[14]|439401001

Rubella infections|36653000
are
prevented|116699007
by active immunisation programs|33879002
using|260676000
live, disabled virus vaccines.|419749002|37362000

Two live attenuated virus vaccines,|420797005|419749002|24588000|49872002|398827000|420797005|419749002|24588000|398827000
RA 27/3
and
Cendehill strains,|48532005|276768000
were
effective|255403003|254648000
in the prevention|169443000
of adult disease.|64342008

However
their use|277889008|419385000
in prepubertile females|248152002
did
not
produce
a significant fall|386134007|1912002
in the overall incidence rate
of CRS|57219006
in the UK.

Reductions|58294000|289928003
were
only
achieved
by immunisation|127785005
of all children.|410601007|160499008

The vaccine|398827000
is
now usually
given|419582001
as part|260726005
of the MMR vaccine.|396429000

The
WHO
recommends
the first dose|255216001|277406006|255216001|408102007|232714002|277406006|232714002|408102007
is
given|419582001
at 12
to 18 months|258706009
of age|424144002
with a second dose|81170007|277406006|81170007|408102007|257997001|277406006|257997001|408102007|288495006|277406006|288495006|408102007
at 36 months.|258706009

Pregnant women|255409004
are
usually
tested|272393004
for immunity|58915005
to rubella early|36653000|264499004
on.

Women|224526002
found|404684003
to
be
susceptible|131196009
are
not
vaccinated
until
after
the baby|418119000
is
born|106970005|81827009|398209006
because
the vaccine|398827000
contains|42504009
live virus.[15]|419749002|49872002|419749002

The immunisation program|127785005
has
been
quite successful.|385669000

Cuba|223701004
declared
the disease|64572001
eliminated
in the 1990s,
and
in 2004
the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|26216008|64572001|31509003|169443000
announced
that

for all women|224526002
of childbearing age|424144002
at their first preconception counseling|255216001|409063005|255216001|265913000|232714002|409063005|232714002|265913000
visit
to
reduce|260400001
incidence
of congenital rubella syndrome|1857005
(CRS|57219006
).

It
is
recommended
that
all susceptible non-pregnant women|131196009|255409004
of childbearing age|424144002
should
be
offered|410527000
rubella vaccination.|82314000

Due to concerns
about possible teratogenicity,|371930009|58694006|60022001|58694006
use|277889008|419385000
of MMR vaccine|396429000
is
not
recommended
during pregnancy.|289908002

Instead,
susceptible pregnant women|131196009|255409004
should
be
vaccinated
as soon
as possible|371930009|60022001
in the postpartum period.[18]|255410009

There
is
no specific treatment|69658003|276239002|69658003|416118004
for Rubella|36653000
;
however,
management|413454004|119270007
is
a matter
of responding
to symptoms to
diminish|1250004
discomfort.|367391008|87128005

Treatment|276239002|416118004
of newly born babies|418119000
is
focused|87017008|363702006
on management|413454004|119270007
of the complications.|116223007

Congenital heart defects_[citation
needed|410525008|103325001

and
cataracts|247053007|95722004
can
be
corrected|370975003
by direct surgery.[19]|255589003|83578000

Management|413454004|119270007
for ocular congenital rubella syndrome (CRS)|81745001|1857005|281004000|1857005|1857005
is
similar
to that
for age-related macular degeneration,|267718000
including|55919000
counseling,|409063005|265913000
regular monitoring,|17854005|302805002
and
the provision
of low vision devices,|397540003|303607000|397540003|49062001
if
required.[20]

Rubella infection|36653000
of children|410601007|160499008
and
adults|133936004
is
usually mild, self-limiting|255604002|255469002
and
often asymptomatic.|70232002|84387000

The prognosis|20481000
in children|410601007|160499008
born|106970005|81827009|398209006
with CRS|57219006
is
poor.[21]|11403006|255351007

Rubella|36653000
is
a disease|64572001
that
occurs|272120004
worldwide.

The virus|49872002
tends
to peak|255587001
during the spring
in countries|223369002
with temperate climates.

Before the vaccine|398827000
to rubella|36653000
was
introduced|127487003
in 1969,
widespread outbreaks usually|85333001|443684005
occurred|272120004
every 6?9 years|260273003|258707000
in the United States|223688001
and
3?5 years|260280001|258707000
in Europe,|223502009
mostly affecting children|247591002|410601007|247591002|160499008|248448006|410601007|248448006|160499008
in the 5-9 year old age group.|264706000|258707000|105436006|261586004|264706000|258707000|105436006|160481000|264706000|258707000|105436006|389109008|264706000|258707000|32864002|261586004|264706000|258707000|32864002|160481000|264706000|258707000|32864002|389109008|264706000|259039008|105436006|261586004|264706000|259039008|105436006|160481000|264706000|259039008|105436006|389109008|264706000|259039008|32864002|261586004|264706000|259039008|32864002|160481000|264706000|259039008|32864002|389109008|264605009|258707000|105436006|261586004|264605009|258707000|105436006|160481000|264605009|258707000|105436006|389109008|264605009|258707000|32864002|261586004|264605009|258707000|32864002|160481000|264605009|258707000|32864002|389109008|264605009|259039008|105436006|261586004|264605009|259039008|105436006|160481000|264605009|259039008|105436006|389109008|264605009|259039008|32864002|261586004|264605009|259039008|32864002|160481000|264605009|259039008|32864002|389109008

Since
the introduction|107733003
of vaccine,|398827000
occurrences|272120004
have
become
rare|84638005|103356009
in those countries|223369002
with high uptake rates.|75540009|258763004|371879000|258763004

Vaccination
has
interrupted|261017006
the transmission|258150004
of rubella|36653000
in the Americas
:
no endemic case|398241000
has
been
observed
since
February 2009.

Since
the virus|49872002
can
always
be
reintroduced
from other continents,|74964007|223497007
the population still|385436007|389109008
need|410525008|103325001
to
remain
vaccinated
to
keep
the western hemisphere
free|37837009
of rubella.|36653000

During the epidemic
in the
US
between 1962?1965,
Rubella virus infections|5210005
during pregnancy|289908002
were
estimated|414135002
to
have
caused|23981006|134198009
30,000 still births|237364002
and
20,000 children to|410601007|160499008
be
born|106970005|81827009|398209006
impaired|260379002|40226000
or
disabled
as a result|394617004
of CRS.|57219006

Universal immunisation|73548004|127785005|73548004
producing
a high level|75540009|258395000|75540009|276625007|371879000|258395000|371879000|276625007
of herd immunity|418788006|58915005
is
important
in the control|31509003
of epidemics
of rubella.[26]|36653000

In the UK,
there
remains
a large population|255509001|385436007|255509001|389109008
of men|339947000
susceptible|131196009
to rubella|36653000
who
have
not
been
vaccinated.

Outbreaks|443684005
of rubella|36653000
occurred|272120004
amongst many young men|84422007|339947000
in the UK
in 1993
and
in 1996
the infection
was
transmitted|60117003|258150004
to pregnant women,|255409004
many
of whom
were
immigrants|161158003
and
were
susceptible.|131196009

Outbreaks still|443684005
arise|68727004
,
usually
in developing countries|223369002
where the vaccine|398827000
is
not
as accessible.[27]|260507000

Rubella|36653000
was
first|255216001|232714002
described
in the mid-eighteenth century.|255562008

Friedrich Hoffmann
made
the first clinical description|255216001|58147004|232714002|58147004
of rubella|36653000
in 1740,
[28]
which
was
confirmed|59156000
by
de Bergen
in 1752
and
Orlow
in 1758.[29]

In 1814,
George
de Maton
first
suggested
that
it
be
considered
a disease|64572001
distinct
from
both
measles|14189004
and
scarlet fever.|30242009

All
these physicians|309343006
were
German,|7695005
and
the disease|64572001
was
known|36692007
as R?theln|24028007
(contemporary German _R?teln_|7695005|24028007
)
,
hence
the common name|72906007
of "German measles".|36653000

Henry Veale,|304612009
an English Royal Artillery surgeon,|297487008|304292004|25804004|304292004
described
an outbreak|443684005
in India.|223600005

He
coined
the name "rubella"|36653000
(
from the Latin word,|255373000
meaning|255586005
"
little red"|386713009|371240000
)
in 1866.[28][31][32][33]|264664006|264667004

It
was
formally
recognised
as an individual entity|125676002|385435006
in 1881,
at the International Congress
of Medicine|410942007
in London.

In 1914,
Alfred Fabian Hess
theorised
that rubella|36653000
was
caused|23981006|134198009
by a virus,|49872002
based|418836005
on work|261041009
with monkeys.|54121002

In 1938,
Hiro
and
Tosaka
confirmed|59156000
this
by passing|223647001
the disease|64572001
to children|410601007|160499008
using|260676000
filtered nasal washings|116250002|260540009|116250002|258648006|260540009|258648006
from acute cases.[32]|272118002|398241000|272118002|413769002

In 1940,
there
was
a widespread epidemic|85333001
of rubella|36653000
in Australia.|223621005

Subsequently,
ophthalmologist Norman McAllister Gregg|422234006
found|404684003
78 cases|398241000|413769002
of congenital cataracts|79410001
in infants|418119000
and
68|264697007
of them
were
born|106970005|81827009|398209006
to mothers|72705000
who
had
caught rubella|30623001|36653000|282673009|36653000
in early pregnancy.|264499004|289908002

Gregg
published
an account,
_Congenital Cataract|79410001
Following|255260001
German Measles|36653000
in the Mother_,|72705000
in 1941.

He
described
a variety
of problems now|55607006
known|36692007
as congenital rubella syndrome (CRS)|1857005
and
noticed
that
the earlier|264499004
the mother|72705000
was
infected
,
the worse|230993007|390772001|231877006
the damage|37782003
was.

The virus|49872002
was
isolated|46651001
in tissue culture|77601007
in 1962
by two separate groups|420797005|263869007|261586004|420797005|263869007|160481000
led|88488004|236874000
by physicians Parkman|309343006
and
Weller.[31][33]|264664006|264667004

There
was
a pandemic
of rubella|36653000
between 1962
and
1965,
starting|255395001|385652002
in Europe|223502009
and
spreading|410677005
to the United States.|223688001

In the years 1964-65,|258707000|264695004
the United States|223688001
had
an estimated 12.5 million rubella cases.|414135002|36653000|398241000|414135002|36653000|413769002

This
led|88488004|236874000
to 11,000 miscarriages|17369002
or
therapeutic abortions|386641000
and
20,000 cases|398241000|413769002
of congenital rubella syndrome.|1857005

Of these,
2,100|260306008
died|419620001|419099009
as neonates,|133933007
12,000
were
deaf,
3,580|260313008
were
blind
and
1,800|260305007
were
mentally retarded.|19367006

In New York alone, CRS|420278009|105529008|57219006
affected|247591002|248448006
1%|260305007
of all births [36][37]|3950001

In 1969
a live attenuated virus vaccine|419749002|24588000|37362000
was
licensed.

In the early 1970s,|264499004
a triple vaccine|76070002|398827000
containing|42504009
attenuated measles,|24588000|14189004
mumps and rubella (MMR) viruses|50384007|36653000|412300006|49872002
