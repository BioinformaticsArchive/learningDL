In medicine,|410942007

*hypoventilation|15993004
*
*
(also
known|36692007
as
*
*respiratory depression|80954004
*
*
)
occurs|272120004
when
ventilation|258162000|45444009
is
inadequate[1]|71978007
(_hypo_ means "|255586005
below"
)
to
perform|398166005
needed gas exchange.|410525008|308698004|410525008|74947009|103325001|308698004|103325001|74947009

By definition
it
causes|134198009
an increased concentration|35105006|82742001|260366006|82742001
of carbon dioxide|421982008
(hypercapnia|29596007
and
respiratory acidosis.|12326000

It
can
be
caused|23981006|134198009
by medical conditions,|74188005|260905004
such as stroke|230690007
affecting|247591002|248448006
the brainstem,|15926001|180925009
by holding one's breath,|90480005|421379005
or
by drugs,|410942007
typically
when
taken|419652001
in overdose.|55680006

Hypocapnia also|61031008
stimulates
hypoventilation.|15993004

As a side effect
of medicines|410942007
or
recreational drugs,|410942007
hypoventilation|15993004
may
become
potentially life-threatening.|224130005

Many different CNS depressant drugs|263735002|321087001
such as alcohol,|419442005|53041004|430837008
benzodiazepines,|372664007
barbiturates,|372798009
GHB,|259470008
sedatives|372614000
and
opiates|5602001|360204007
produce
respiratory depression|80954004
when
taken|419652001
in large|255509001
or
excessive doses|260378005|277406006
;
however
this
is
most commonly|4757001
seen
as a cause|134198009
of death|419620001|268923008
with opiates|5602001|360204007
or
opioids,|404642006
particularly
when
they
are
combined|89780004
with sedatives|372614000
such as alcohol|419442005|53041004|430837008
or
benzodiazepines.|372664007

Strong opiates,|260404005|5602001|260404005|260404005|360204007
(fentanyl,|373492002
heroin,|387341002
morphine,|373529000|442759006
etc.
)
,
barbiturates,|372798009
and
the benzodiazepine,|372664007|574005
temazepam,|387300007
are
notorious
for producing
this effect|253861007
;
in an overdose,|55680006
an individual|125676002|385435006
may
cease
breathing|14910006|258162000
entirely
(
go
into respiratory arrest|248583008|87317003
which
is
rapidly fatal|418694008|399166001
without treatment.|276239002|416118004

Respiratory stimulants|418760000
such as nikethamide|387591002
were
traditionally
used|394850002
to
counteract
respiratory depression|80954004
from CNS depressant overdose,|55680006
but
were
of only limited effectiveness.|50607009|255469002|255403003|420295001|255469002|255403003

A new respiratory stimulant drug BIMU8|7147002|418760000|410942007
is
currently|15240007
being
investigated|116698004
which
seems
to
be
significantly more effective|255403003|254648000
and
may
be
useful
for counteracting
the respiratory depression|80954004
produced
by opiates|5602001|360204007
and
similar drugs|410942007
without offsetting
their therapeutic effects.|262202000|253861007

If
the respiratory depression|80954004
is
from opioid overdose,|404642006|55680006
then
the overdose|55680006
itself
is
usually
treated|28995006
with an inverse agonist,|255513008|102498003
most likely naloxone,|2931005|372890007
which
will
itself almost instantaneously
stop|422117008
the respiratory depression|80954004
if
caused|23981006|134198009
by an opioid|404642006
(
and
also,
depending
on the dose,|277406006|408102007
plunge
the patient|116154003
into precipitated withdrawal.

Disorders|64572001
referred|439980006
to
as "Congenital Central Hypoventilation Syndrome"|399040002
or
"CCHS"|399040002
and
"Rapid-Onset Obesity,|255358001|77374008|414915002
Hypothalamic Dysfunction,|111568001
Hypoventilation,|15993004
with Autonomic Dysregulation"|72167002
or
ROHHAD
are
recognized.

CCHS condition|399040002|260905004
may
be
a significant factor|386134007
in some cases|398241000|413769002
of sudden infant death syndrome|51178009
or
SIDS,|51178009
often|70232002
termed "cot death"|51178009
or
"crib death."|51178009

The opposite condition|260905004
is
hyperventilation|68978004
(too
much ventilation|258162000|45444009
)
,
resulting|42752001
in low carbon dioxide levels|62482003|421982008|258395000|371880002|421982008|258395000
