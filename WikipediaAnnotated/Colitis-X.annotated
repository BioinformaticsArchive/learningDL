Colitis-X|86604004
is
a term
used|394850002
for colitis cases|64226004|398241000|64226004|413769002
in which
no definitive diagnosis|261002007|439401001|261002007
can
be
made
and
the horse dies.|35354009|388441000|388445009

Clinical signs|58147004|72670004
include|55919000
sudden, watery diarrhea|255363002|263930000|398032003
that
is
usually
accompanied
by symptoms
of hypovolemic shock|39419009
and
usually
leads|88488004|236874000
to death|419620001|268923008
in 3|260313008
to 48 hours,|255249005
usually
in less|276139006|263796003
than 24 hours.|123027009|259029002

Other clinical signs|74964007|58147004|72670004
include|55919000
tachycardia,|3424008|6285003
tachypnea,|271823003
and
a weak pulse.|64661000

Marked depression|46998006|46998006|35489007|46998006|366979004|46998006|255339005
is
present.|52101004|246105001

An explosive diarrhea|66113009|398032003
develops
,
resulting|42752001
in extreme dehydration.|12565001|34095006

Hypovolemic
and
endotoxic shock|371769008
are
manifest|250255003
by increased capillary refill time,|50427001
congested
or
cyanotic|119419001
(purplish
)
mucous membranes,|313268005
and
cold extremities.|15336001

While
there
may
initially|884001
be
a fever,|386661006
temperature usually|105723007|246508008
returns|7528007
to normal.[1][2]|17621005|258744000

Clinical signs|58147004|72670004
are
similar
to those
of other diarrheal diseases,|74964007|128333008
including|55919000
toxemia|15394000
caused|23981006|134198009
by _Clostridium_,|8191000
Potomac horse fever,|24466002
experimental endotoxic shock,|371769008
and
anaphylaxis.[1]|39579001

To date,|410671006
the precise causative factor
has
not
been
verified
,
and
the disease|64572001
has
been
attributed|246061005
by various sources|256220008|260753009
to viruses,|49872002
parasites,|37763007
bacteria,|409822003
use|277889008|419385000
of antibiotics|255631004
and
sulfonamides|387406002
and
heavy metal poisoning.|67181005

Other possible causes|74964007|371930009|134198009|74964007|60022001|134198009
include|55919000
peracute salmonellosis,|42338000|302231008
clostridial enterocolitis,|8191000|43752006
and
endotoxemia.|371770009

Of interest|225469004
is
that _Clostridium difficile_ toxins|12671002
isolated|46651001
in the horse|35354009|388441000|388445009
have
a genotype
that
is
also
that
of the current human "epidemic strain,|15240007|278412004|48532005|15240007|278412004|276768000
"
which
is
associated|47429007
with human _C.|278412004

difficile_-associated disease|47429007|64572001
of greater|263768009
than historical severity.|272141005|392521001|272141005

_C.

difficile_
can
cause|23981006|134198009
pseudomembranous colitis
in humans,|278412004
[5]|264706000|264605009
and
in hospitalized patients|184091000|116154003
who
develop
it,
fulminant _C.

difficile_ colitis|64226004
is
a significant|386134007
and
increasing cause|260369004|134198009
of death.[6]|419620001|268923008

Horses|35354009
under stress|262188008
appear
to
be
more susceptible|242762006|131196009
to developing colitis X.|86604004

Disease onset|217315002
is
often closely|70232002
associated|47429007
with surgery|83578000
or
transport.|57188001|360300001

Excess protein|260378005|88878007
and
lack|41277001
of cellulose content|68992005|276824008
in the diet|41829006
(
a diet|41829006
heavy|410712002
on grain|23182003|264331002
and
lacking adequate hay|41277001|51117008|41277001|88323005
or
similar roughage
)
is
thought to|88952004
be
the trigger|410658008
for the multiplication
of _clostridial_ organisms.|8191000

A similar condition|260905004
may
be
seen
after administration|413454004|416118004
of tetracycline|372809001|16355005|282831004
or
lincomycin|372677003
to horses.|35354009

These factors
may
be
one|421379005
reason|410666004
the condition often|260905004|70232002
develops
in race horses,|415229000|35354009
having
been
responsible|394851003
for the deaths|419620001|268923008
of the Thoroughbred filly Landaluce,
[7][8]
the Quarter Horse stallion Lightning Bar,|76467006|5193003|428003006
[9]
and
is
one theory|421379005
for the sudden death|26636000|95281009
of Kentucky Derby winner Swale.[7]|224062005

The link
to stress|262188008
suggests
that
the condition|260905004
may
be
brought|68369002
on
by changes|243326001|263703002
in the microflora
of the cecum|32713005|181256004
and
colon|263977005|302508007
that
lower|261122009
the number|410680006|410681005
of anaerobic bacteria,|59343002
increase|260366006
the number|410680006|410681005
of gram-negative enteric bacteria,|81325006|225770002
and
decrease|260400001|260370003
anaerobic fermentation|40336005
of soluble carbohydrates,|2331003
resulting|42752001
in damage|37782003
to the cecal|32713005
and
colonic mucosa|68502009
and
allowing increased absorption|35105006|260366006
of endotoxins|18127008
from the lumen|113342003|342806003|398252006
of the gut.[10]|122865005

The causative agent|362944004
may
be
_Clostridium perfringens_,|8331005
Type A,|261664005
but
the bacteria|409822003
are
recoverable only
in the preliminary stages|261420005|261612004
of the disease.[3]|64572001

The suspect toxin|415684004|80917008
could
also
be
a form|246176004
of _Clostridium difficile_.|5933001

In a 2009 study|110465008|224699009
at the University of Arizona,|224871002|224041009
_Clostridium difficile_ toxins|12671002
A
and
B
were
detected|260373001
,
large numbers|255509001|410680006|255509001|410681005
of _C.

difficile_
were
isolated|46651001
,
and
genetic characterization|3950001|255395001
revealed|263857004
them to
be
North American pulsed-field gel electrophoresis type 1,|160516002|252329009|258191002
polymerase chain reaction ribotype 027,|258066000
and
toxinotype III.|257471003

Genes|67271001
for the binary toxin|80917008
were
present,|52101004|246105001
and
toxin negative-regulator tcdC|80917008|260385009
contained|42504009
an 18-bp deletion.

The individual animal|125676002|387961004|385435006|387961004
studied|110465008|224699009
in this case|398241000
was
diagnosed|439401001
as
having
peracute typhlocolitis,|74744007
with lesions
and
history|392521001
typical
of those
attributed|246061005
to colitis X.[4]|86604004

Use|277889008|419385000
of antibiotics|255631004
may
also
be
associated|47429007
with some
forms|246176004
of colitis-X.|86604004

In humans,|278412004
_C.

difficile_
is
the most serious cause|4757001|42745003|134198009
of antibiotic-associated diarrhea,|301469002
often|70232002
a result|394617004
of eradication
of the normal gut flora|23506009|122865005
by antibiotics.|255631004

In one equine study,|421379005|35354009|110465008|421379005|35354009|224699009
colitis|64226004
was
induced|16404004
after pretreatment
with clindamycin|372786004
and
lincomycin,|372677003
followed|367409002
by intestinal content|84650004
from horses|35354009
which
had
died|419620001|419099009
from naturally-
occurring|272120004
idiopathic colitis.|359660000

(
A classic adverse effect|255301002|281647001|255301002|255333006|281647001|255333006
of clindamycin|372786004
in humans|278412004
is
_Clostridium difficile_-associated diarrhea.[13]|5933001|47429007|398032003
)
In the experiment,
the treated horses|28995006|35354009
died.|419620001|419099009

After necropsy,|168461002
_Clostridium cadaveris_|16616000
was
present,|52101004|246105001
and
is
proposed
as another possible causative agent|371930009|362944004|60022001|362944004
in some cases|398241000|413769002
of fatal colitis.[11]|399166001|64226004

At necropsy,|168461002
edema|423666004
and
hemorrhage|131148009
in the wall|224727009
of the large colon|255509001|263977005|255509001|302508007
and
cecum|32713005|181256004
are
pronounced
,
and
the intestinal contents|84650004
are
fluid|32457005|33463005|255765007
and
often blood-stained.|70232002|87612001|397165007|70232002|87612001|127790008|70232002|119273009|397165007|70232002|119273009|127790008

Macroscopic|255344003
and
microscopic findings|84496004|404684003|84496004
include|55919000
signs|72670004
of disseminated intravascular coagulation,|67406007
necrosis|6574001
of colonic mucosa|68502009
and
presence|386397008
of large numbers|255509001|410680006|255509001|410681005
of bacteria|409822003
in the devitalized parts|260726005
of the intestine.|261093006

Typically,
the PCV
is
>65% even shortly|264695004
after the onset|77374008
of clinical signs.|58147004|72670004

The leukogram ranges
from normal|17621005|258744000
to neutropenia|165517008
with a degenerative left shift.|33359002|87361006

Metabolic acidosis|59455009
and
electrolyte disorders|237840007
are
also
present.|52101004|246105001

There
is
leucopenia,|419188005
initially|884001
characterized
by neutropenia,|165517008
which
might
evolve|59381007
in neutrophilia.|414850009

Moreover,
haemoconcentration
is
noted
with an increase|260366006
in the packed cell volume|28317006
;
total proteins|304383000
are
initially|884001
increased|35105006|260366006
,
but
changes|243326001|263703002
into a lower|261122009
than normal value.|260395002

The most significant laboratory finding|371925005|118246004
in colitis X|86604004
is
the increase|260366006
of total cortisol concentration|258755000|396458002|82742001|255619001|396458002|82742001
in blood plasma.|419185008

Histopathologically,
the mucosa|313268005
of the large colon|255509001|263977005|255509001|302508007
is
hemorrhagic, necrotic|88880001
and
covered|255334000
with fibrohemorrhagic exudate,|247450001
while
the submucosa,|68439008
the muscular tunic|91727004|263816006
and
the local lymphonodes|255470001
are
edematous.[2]|423666004

Treatment|276239002|416118004
for colitis-X usually|86604004
does
not
save the horse.|35354009|388441000|388445009

The prognosis|20481000
is
average
to poor|11403006|255351007
and
mortality|409651001
is
90%|264705001|264703008
to 100%.

However,
there
are
ways to
treat|395077000
the condition,|260905004
and
one famous horse|421379005|35354009|421379005|388441000|421379005|388445009

Large amounts|255509001|107651007
of IV fluids|118431008
are
needed|410525008|103325001
to counter|303502004
the severe dehydration,|24484000|34095006
and
electrolyte replacement|86355000|3137001|86355000|282089006
is
often necessary.|70232002

Flunixin meglumine|96174002
(Banamine
)
may
help
block|26036001|112232007
the effects|253861007
of toxemia.|15394000

Mortality rate|409651001
has
been
theorized
to
fall|1912002
to 75%
if
treatment|276239002|416118004
is
prompt
and
aggressive,|61372001
including|55919000
administration|413454004|416118004
of
not only fluids|32457005|33463005
and
electrolytes,|86355000
but
also blood plasma,|419185008
anti-inflammatory|330901000
and
analgesic drugs|373265006
and
antibiotics.|255631004

Preventing dehydration|34095006|116699007|34095006
is
extremely important.

Nutrition|87276001|384759009
is
also important.

Either
parenteral
or
normal feeding|17621005|129007004|258744000|129007004
can
be
used|394850002
to
support|9096001|243114000
the stressed metabolism|262188008|47722004
of the sick horse.|35354009|388441000|388445009

Finally,
the use|277889008|419385000
of probiotics
is
considered beneficial
in the restoration|260938008
of the normal intestinal flora.|23506009|261093006

The probiotics most often|70232002
used|394850002
for this purpose|363675004
contain|42504009
_Lactobacillus_|43690008
