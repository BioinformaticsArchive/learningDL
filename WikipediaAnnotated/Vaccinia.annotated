*Vaccinia** virus|13126002
(

*VACV
*

)
is
a large, complex,|255509001|103360007
enveloped
virus belonging|49872002
to the poxvirus family.|424976006|35359004

It
has
a linear, double-stranded DNA genome approximately 190 kbp|50009006|13925004|18470003|26175008|304615006
in length,|410668003
and
which
encodes
for approximately 250 genes.|26175008|67271001

The dimensions|255506008
of the virion|285296008
are
roughly 360 ? 270 ? 250 nm,
with a mass|300848003|118538004
of approximately 5-10 fg.|26175008|258688001

Vaccinia virus|13126002
is
well known|20572008|36692007
for its role
as a vaccine|398827000
(
its namesake
)
that
eradicated
the smallpox disease,|67924001
making
it the first human disease to|255216001|278412004|64572001|232714002|278412004|64572001
be
successfully
eradicated
by science.

This endeavour
was
carried|288345009
out
by the World Health Organization|263775005|21139007
under the Smallpox Eradication Program.|67924001|243568000

Post eradication|288563008
of smallpox,|67924001|243568000
scientists|308027003
study|110465008|224699009
Vaccinia virus to|13126002
use|277889008|419385000
as a tool|86967005
for delivering genes|67271001
into biological tissues
(gene therapy|394613000
and
genetic engineering.|3950001|106269003|255395001|106269003

In the early 21st century,|264499004
due to concerns
about smallpox|67924001|243568000
being
used|394850002
as an agent|260872001
for bioterrorism,
there
was
renewed
interest|225469004
in studying|110465008|224699009
the Vaccinia virus.|13126002

Vaccinia infections|111852003|13126002
may
be
divided|422033008
into the following types|255260001|261664005
:
[3]|260313008
:

Vaccinia virus|13126002
is
closely
related|272151006|262094002
to the virus|49872002
that
causes|134198009
cowpox|70090004
;
historically
the two|420797005
were
often|70232002
considered to
be
one|421379005
and
the same.|262126009

The precise origin|255395001
of vaccinia virus|13126002
is
unknown|261665006
,
however,
due to the lack|41277001
of record-keeping
as the virus|49872002
was
repeatedly|27582007
cultivated
and
passaged|255592004
in research laboratories|261904005
for many decades.

The most common notion|4757001|72906007
is
that vaccinia virus,|13126002
cowpox virus,|37362000
and
variola virus|243568000
(
the causative agent|362944004
of smallpox|67924001|243568000
)
were
all
derived
from a common ancestral virus.|72906007|49872002|72906007

There
is
also
speculation
that vaccinia virus|13126002
was
originally
isolated|46651001
from horses.[4]|35354009

Poxviruses|424976006
are
unique
among DNA viruses|32478008
because
they
replicate|1305003|27582007
only
in the cytoplasm
of the host cell,|4421005|362837007
outside of the nucleus.|84640000

Therefore,
the large genome|255509001|18470003
is
required
for encoding various enzymes|256220008|90668006
and
proteins|88878007
involved|248448006
in viral DNA replication|74256009
and
gene transcription.|10589004

During its replication cycle,|74256009|44180009
VV
produces
four infectious forms|421534005|246176004
which
differ
in their outer membranes|261074009|83097008
:
intracellular mature virion (IMV),|83167003|34071009|285296008
the intracellular enveloped virion (IEV),|83167003|285296008
the cell-associated enveloped virion|4421005|47429007|285296008|362837007|47429007|285296008
(CEV
)
and
the extracellular enveloped virion|69320009|285296008
(EEV
).

Although
the issue|55607006
remains
contentious,
the prevailing view|246516004
is
that
the IMV
consists
of a single lipoprotein membrane,|125681006|301861005|83097008|50607009|301861005|83097008
while
the CEV
and
EEV
are
both
surrounded|355648006
by two membrane layers|420797005|83097008
and
the IEV
has
three envelopes.|421291004

The IMV
is
the most abundant infectious form|4757001|246176004
and
is
thought to|88952004
be
responsible|394851003
for
spread|410677005
between hosts.

On the other hand,|74964007|85562004|74964007|302539009
the CEV
is
believed to
play|300776002
a role
in cell-to-cell|4421005|362837007
spread|410677005
and
the EEV
is
thought to|88952004
be
important
for long range dissemination|255511005|65709003
within the host organism.|410653004

Vaccinia|111852003|13126002
contains|42504009
within its genome several proteins|18470003|88878007
that
give|419582001
the virus resistance|49872002|30714006|30714006
to interferons.|49327004

K3L
is
a protein|88878007
with homology
to the protein _eukaryotic initiation factor 2_|88878007|415671008|312009002
(eIF-2alpha
).

K3L protein|88878007
inhibits|61511001
the action|129264002
of PKR,
an activator
of interferons.|49327004

E3L
is
another protein|88878007
encoded
by Vaccinia.|111852003|13126002

E3L also
inhibits|61511001
PKR activation
;
and
is
also able to|371150009
bind|257768005
to double stranded RNA.[8]|102761003

A Vaccinia virus infection|13126002|111852003|34014006|13126002|34014006
is
very mild|260358002|255604002
and
is
typically asymptomatic|84387000
in healthy individuals,|263775005|125676002|263775005|385435006
but
it
may
cause|23981006|134198009
a mild rash|255604002|271807003
and
fever.|386661006

Immune responses|35024006
generated
from a Vaccinia virus infection|13126002|111852003|34014006|13126002|34014006
protects
the person|125676002
against a lethal smallpox infection.|67924001|243568000

For this reason,|410666004
Vaccinia virus|13126002
was
,
and
is
still
being
used|394850002
as a live-virus vaccine|419749002|37362000
against smallpox.|67924001|243568000

Unlike vaccines|398827000
that
use|277889008|419385000
weakened forms|246176004
of the virus|49872002
being
vaccinated
against,
the Vaccinia virus vaccine|398756008
cannot
cause|23981006|134198009
a smallpox infection|67924001|243568000
because
it
does
not
contain|42504009
the smallpox virus.|243568000

However,
certain complications|17162000|116223007
and/or
vaccine adverse effects occasionally|398827000
arise.|68727004

The chance
of this happening
is
significantly
increased|35105006|260366006
in people|125676002
who
are
immunocompromised.|370391006

Approximately|26175008
one|421379005
in one million individuals|421379005|125676002|421379005|385435006
will
develop
a fatal response|399166001
to the vaccination.

Currently,|15240007
the vaccine|398827000
is
only
administered|418283001
to health care workers
or
research personnel
who
have
a high risk|15508007
of contracting|78558002
the variola virus,|243568000
and
to the military personnel|302314004
of the United States of America.|223688001

Due to the present threat|52101004|246105001
of smallpox-related bioterrorism,|67924001|272151006|67924001|262094002|243568000|272151006|243568000|262094002
there
is
a possibility
the vaccine|398827000
may
have
to
be
widely
administered|418283001
again
in the future.

Therefore,
scientists|308027003
are
currently|15240007
developing
novel vaccine strategies|7147002|398827000
against smallpox|67924001|243568000
which
are
safer
and
much faster|242762006|16985007|242762006|277748003|4757001|16985007|4757001|277748003
to deploy
during a bioterrorism event.|272379006

On September 1,
2007,
the U.S.|223688001
Food and Drug Administration (FDA)|255620007|18629005
licensed
a new vaccine ACAM2000|7147002|398827000
against smallpox|67924001|243568000
which
can
be
produced
quickly
upon need.|410525008|103325001

Manufactured
by Acambis
of Cambridge,
England,|223664003
and
Cambridge,
Massachusetts,|224066008
the U.S.|223688001

Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|26216008|64572001|31509003|169443000
stockpiled
192.5 million doses|277406006
of the new vaccine|7147002|398827000
(
see|281004000
list
of common strains|72906007|48532005|72906007|276768000
below
).[9]

_Vaccinia_|111852003|13126002
is
also
used|394850002
in recombinant vaccines,|398827000
as
a vector|260529001
for expression|10012005
of foreign genes|67271001
within a host,
in order to
generate
an immune response.|35024006

Other poxviruses|74964007|424976006
are
also
used|394850002
as live recombinant vaccines.[10]|419749002|398827000

The original vaccine|19535007|398827000
for smallpox,|67924001|243568000
and
the origin|255395001
of the idea|363878000
of vaccination,
was
Cowpox,|70090004
reported|229059009|223458004
on
by Edward Jenner
in 1796.

The Latin term
used|394850002
for Cowpox|70090004
was
_variola vaccina_,|67924001
essentially
a direct translation|255589003
of "cow-related pox".|70090004|272151006|70090004|262094002

That term
lent
its name
to the whole idea|260232004|363878000
of vaccination.

When
it
was
realized
that
the virus|49872002
used|394850002
in smallpox vaccination|40001004
was
not,
or
was
no longer,|255511005
the same|262126009
as the Cowpox virus,|37362000
the name 'vaccinia'|111852003|13126002
stayed
with the vaccine-related virus.|37362000|272151006|37362000|262094002

(
See|281004000
OED.
)
Vaccine potency|398827000|30207005
and
efficacy
prior to the invention
of refrigerated methods|260686004|272394005
of transportation
was
unreliable.

The vaccine|398827000
would
be
rendered
impotent|397803000
by heat|88999006
and
sunlight,|49926000
and
the method|260686004|272394005
of drying samples|257791009|123038009
on quills|360321001
and
shipping|224673002
them
to countries|223369002
in need often|410525008|70232002|103325001|70232002
resulted|42752001|394617004
in an inactive vaccine.|73425007|398827000

Another method|260686004|272394005
employed|224363007
was
the "arm|40983000|53120007|182245002|302538001
to arm" method.|40983000|260686004|40983000|272394005|53120007|260686004|53120007|272394005|182245002|260686004|182245002|272394005|302538001|260686004|302538001|272394005

This involved vaccinating|248448006
an individual then transferring|125676002|129005007|385435006|129005007
it
to another
as soon
as the infectious pustule forms,|271760008|246176004
then
to another,
etc.

This method|260686004|272394005
was
used|394850002
as a form|246176004
of living transportation
of the vaccine,|398827000
and
usually employed orphans|224363007|373929005
as carriers.|47461006

However,
this method|260686004|272394005
was
problematic
due to the possibility
of
spreading|410677005
other blood diseases,|74964007|34093004
such as hepatitis|128241005|40468003|396423004
and
syphilis.|76272004

contracted|78558002
syphilis|76272004
after
being
vaccinated
by the arm|40983000|53120007|182245002|302538001

in 1861.[11]

In 1913,
E.

Steinhardt,
C.

Israeli,
and
R.|24028007

A.

Lambert
grew
vaccinia virus|13126002
in fragments|29140007
of guinea pig corneal tissue culture.[12]|392192009|28726007|77601007|125076001|28726007|77601007

In 1939 Alan Downie
showed
that
the smallpox vaccines|396439006
being
used|394850002
in the 20th century
and
cowpox virus|37362000
were
not
the same,|262126009
but
some
sorts
of cousins.[13][14]|55538000

In March 2007,
a 2-year-old Indiana boy|260306008|258707000|70753007|224059007|433152004|260306008|259039008|70753007|224059007|433152004
and
his mother|72705000
contracted|78558002
a life-threatening vaccinia infection|224130005|111852003|224130005|13126002
from the boy's father.|433152004|66839005

The boy|433152004
developed
the telltale rash|271807003
over 80 percent|118582008
of his body|279495008|123037004
after coming|237679004|288563008
into close contact|29179001|11723008|29179001|70862002
with his father,|66839005
who
was
vaccinated
for smallpox|67924001|243568000
before
being
deployed overseas
by the United States Army.|223688001

The United States military|223688001|302314004
resumed smallpox vaccinations|40001004
in 2002.

The child|410601007|160499008
acquired|255396000
the infection
due to eczema,|281104002
which
is
a known risk factor|36692007|80943009
for vaccinia infection.|111852003|13126002

The boy|433152004
was
treated|28995006
with intravenous immunoglobulin,|350344000
cidofovir,|386894007
and
an experimental drug|902003
being
developed
by SIGA Technologies.|29661001

On April 19,
2007,
he
was
sent
home|261770009
with no after effects|237679004|253861007|288563008|253861007
except for possible scarring|371930009|371930009|275322007|60022001|60022001|275322007
of the skin.[15]|119325001|39937001|181469002

In 2010,
the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|26216008|64572001|31509003|169443000
(CDC
)
reported|229059009|223458004
that
a woman|224526002
