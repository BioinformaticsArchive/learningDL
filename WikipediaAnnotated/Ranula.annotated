is
a type|261664005
of mucocele|19633006
found|404684003
on the floor
of the mouth.|74262004|123851003|21082005|181220002

Ranulas|69825009|14919007
present|52101004|246105001
as a swelling|423666004|442672001
of connective tissue|181769001
consisting
of collected mucin|425757009
from a ruptured salivary gland duct,|415747007|86961006|263862003|86961006
which
is
usually
caused|23981006|134198009
by local trauma.|255470001|255470001

The Latin _rana_ means frog,|47843009|255586005|47843009|47843009|255586005|107226004
and
a ranula|69825009|14919007
is
so|223528007
named|27468005
because
its appearance|386548000|255412001
is
sometimes
compared
to a frog's underbelly.|47843009|107226004

An oral ranula|260548002|69825009|260548002|14919007
is
a fluctuant swelling|300583006|423666004|300583006|442672001
with a bluish translucent|300828005
color|263714004
that somewhat
resembles
the underbelly
of a frog Rana.|47843009|47843009|107226004|47843009

If
it
is
deeper|131197000
it
does
not
have
this bluish appearance.|386548000|255412001

If
it
is
large|255509001
( 2|260306008
or
more cm.|242762006
)
,
it
may
hide|421332005
the salivary gland|75535001|181236000
and
affect|4065008
the location|246267002
of the tongue.|21974007|181226008

Most frequently|4757001|70232002
it
stems
from the sublingual salivary gland,|88481005
but
also
from the submandibular gland.|385296007|181235001

Though
normally
above the mylohyoid muscle,|15152006
if
a ranula|69825009|14919007
is
found deeper|404684003|131197000|131197000
in the floor
of the mouth,|74262004|123851003|21082005|181220002
it
can
appear
to
have
a normal color.|77775007

A ranula|69825009|14919007
below the mylohyoid muscle|15152006
is
referred to|439980006
as
a "plunging
or
cervical ranula",|261064006|69825009|261064006|14919007
and
produces
swelling|423666004|442672001
of the neck|45048000|302550007
with
or
without swelling|423666004|442672001
in the floor
of the mouth.|74262004|123851003|21082005|181220002

Ranulas|69825009|14919007
measure|246445000|272391002
several centimeters|261028005|258672001
in diameter|81827009
and
are
usually larger|255509001|263768009
than mucoceles.|19633006

As a result,|394617004
when
ranulas|69825009|14919007
are
present|52101004|246105001
the tongue|21974007|181226008
may
be
elevated.|75540009

As
with mucoceles,|19633006
ranulas|69825009|14919007
may
be
subject to recurrent swelling|255227004|423666004|255227004|442672001
with occasional rupturing|84638005|415747007|84638005|263862003
of its contents.|276824008

When
pressed
,
they
may
not blanch.

Ranulas|69825009|14919007
may
be
asymptomatic,|84387000
although
they
can
fluctuate|255341006
rapidly|418694008
in size,|277049003
shrinking
and
swelling,|423666004|442672001
making
most ranulas hard to|69825009|72505002|14919007|72505002
detect.|260373001

However,
if
it
gets
large enough|255509001
it
may
interfere|78235001
with swallowing.|54731003|288937009

Since
the lesion
is
deep seated one,|131197000|33586001|421379005|131197000|360297006|421379005
the overlying mucosa|255547006|313268005
is
usually intact.|11163003
the tongue|21974007|181226008
may
be
elevated|75540009
and
when
it
is
large,|255509001
it
may
hide|421332005
the salivary gland.|75535001|181236000

The swelling|423666004|442672001
is
not
fixed|102491009|261010008
and
is
non-painful|22253000
unless
it
becomes
secondarily
infected.

Microscopically,
ranulas|69825009|14919007
are
cystic saliva filled distensions|441457006|256897009|25322007|20476009|256897009|25322007
of salivary gland ducts|86961006
on the floor
of the mouth|74262004|123851003|21082005|181220002
alongside the tongue,|21974007|181226008
and
lack|41277001
a true epithelium.|31874001|31610004

Treatment|276239002|416118004
of ranulas|69825009|14919007
could
involve|248448006
either
marsupialization|118627006
or
more often excision|242762006|70232002|118292001|242762006|70232002|128303001
of both
the gland|362884007
and
lesion.

Ranulas|69825009|14919007
are
likely to|2931005
recur|246455001
if
the sublingual gland|88481005
or
other gland causing|74964007|362884007|23981006
them
is
not also
removed|127485006
with the lesion.

There
is
little morbidity
or
mortality|409651001
connected
with treatment.|276239002|416118004
