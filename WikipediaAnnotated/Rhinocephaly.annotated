*Cyclopia|205798005

*
(also
*
*cyclocephaly|205798005
*
*
or
*
*synophthalmia|205798005
*

)
is
a rare form|84638005|246176004|103356009|246176004
of holoprosencephaly|30915001
and
is
a congenital disorder|66091009
(birth defect|276654001|276720006
)
characterized
by the failure|76797004
of the embryonic prosencephalon|57991002|81861006
to properly
divide|422033008
the orbits|363654007
of the eye|81745001|244486005
into two cavities.|420797005|80967001|420797005|91806002|420797005|2483006

Its incidence
is
1
in 16,000
in born animals,|387961004
and
1
in 250
in embryos,|57991002
one|421379005
in 2,500|260306008
that end|261782000|422117008
in miscarriage.[1]|17369002

Typically,
the face|89545001|302549007
is
either
missing
or
replaced|282089006|370124000
with a non-functioning nose|246464006|260540009|246464006|181195007
in the form|246176004
of a proboscis.|95938003

Such
a proboscis generally|95938003
appears
above the central eye,|26216008|81745001|26216008|244486005
or
on the back,|123961009|255551008|281213008|302552004|77568009
and
is
characteristic
of a form|246176004
of cyclopia|205798005
called
*
*rhinencephaly
*
*
or
*
*rhinocephaly|95241002
*
*.

Most|4757001
such embryos|57991002
are
either
naturally
aborted
or
are
stillborn
upon delivery.|236973005|118215003

Although
cyclopia|205798005
is
rare, several cyclopic human babies|84638005|205798005|278412004|418119000|103356009|205798005|278412004|418119000
are
preserved|277405005
in medical museums|74188005|264370008
(e.g.|258795003

The Vrolik Museum,|264370008
Amsterdam
).[3]|260313008

Some extreme cases|12565001|398241000|12565001|413769002
of cyclopia|205798005
have
been
documented|397934002
in inbred farm animals|224816003|387961004
(horses,|35354009
sheep,|388254009|255392003
pigs,|106996007|78678003
and
sometimes chickens|409910000|226955001
).

In such cases,|398241000|413769002
the nose|260540009|181195007
and
mouth|74262004|123851003|21082005|181220002
fail
to
form|246176004
,
or
the nose|260540009|181195007
grows
from the roof|224738009
of the mouth obstructing airflow,|74262004|263821009|4601000|123851003|263821009|4601000|21082005|263821009|4601000|181220002|263821009|4601000
resulting|42752001
in suffocation shortly after birth.[4]|66466001|3950001

Genetic problems|3950001|55607006|255395001|55607006
or
toxins|80917008
can
cause|23981006|134198009
problems|55607006
in the embryonic forebrain-dividing process.|57991002|81861006|422033008|415178003

One highly teratogenic alkaloid toxin|421379005|75540009|45986006|419001004|80917008|421379005|75540009|45986006|45695000|80917008|421379005|75540009|58694006|419001004|80917008|421379005|75540009|58694006|45695000|80917008
that
can
cause|23981006|134198009
cyclopia|205798005
is
cyclopamine|11622005
or
2-deoxyjervine,|260306008
found|404684003
in the plant _Veratrum californicum_|31006001|50945007
(also
known|36692007
as
_corn lily_|50945007
or
_false hellebore_|10908002|80137008
).

The mistake
of ingesting _Veratrum californicum_|111984006|50945007
while
pregnant|77386006|127362006
is
often|70232002
because
hellebore,|84957003
a plant|31006001
with which
it
is
easily|36203004
confused|286933003
,
is
recommended
as a natural treatment|510009|276239002|510009|416118004
for vomiting,|249497008
cramps,|55300003
and
poor circulation,
three|421291004
conditions|78326006|260905004
that
are
quite common|72906007
in pregnant women.|255409004

Cyclopia|205798005
can
occur|272120004
in the womb|35039007|181452004
when
certain proteins|17162000|88878007
are
inappropriately
expressed
[7]
and
causes|134198009
the brain to|12738006|258335003
stay
whole|260232004
instead of forming|35810008
into two distinct hemispheres,|420797005
which also means|255586005
one|421379005
optic lobe|81745001
and
one olfactory lobe|421379005|360463001
resulting|42752001
in one eye.[8]|421379005|81745001|421379005|244486005

Shh
(Sonic Hedgehog Gene Regulator,|106922004|67271001|388917009|67271001
named|27468005
after the effects|253861007
a mutation|55446002
in the gene|67271001
had
on the forming embryo|35810008|57991002
of fruit flies|72511004|367378007
studied|110465008|224699009
by scientists|308027003
;
a spiky appearance|386548000|255412001
under a microscope,|65473004
similar
to that
of its video game character namesake|257194007
)
is
involved|248448006
in the separation|16640008|160788005
of the single eye field|125681006|81745001|255798002|125681006|244486005|255798002|50607009|81745001|255798002|50607009|244486005|255798002
into two bilateral fields.|420797005|51440002|255798002

Although
not
proven|277025001
,
it
is
thought|88952004
that shh
emitted|113067009
from the prechordal plate|271003
suppresses|245780008
Pax6
which
causes|134198009
the eye field to|81745001|255798002|244486005|255798002
divide|422033008
into two.|420797005

If
the shh gene|67271001
is
mutated,|55446002
the result|394617004
is
cyclopia,|205798005
a single eye|125681006|81745001|125681006|244486005|50607009|81745001|50607009|244486005
in the center|26216008
of the face|89545001|302549007
(Gilbert,
2000
).

_First_,|255216001|232714002
That
it
had
no sign|72670004
of any _Nose_|260540009|181195007
in the usual place,|257557008|421066005
nor
had
it any,
in any other place|74964007|257557008|74964007|421066005
of the Head,|69536005|302548004
unless
the double Bagg CC|1305003
that
grew
out of the midst
of the forehead,|52795006
were
some rudiment
of it.

_Next_,|18769003|255260001
That
the _two Eyes_|420797005|81745001
were
united
into one _Double Eye_|421379005|1305003|81745001|421379005|1305003|244486005
which
was
placed|257557008|421066005
just
in the middle|255562008|399488007
of the Brow.[9]
