Rakel's Textbook
of Family Medicine states,|419772000|398070004
"
A common misconception|72906007
is
that children|410601007|160499008
with crossed eyes|16596007
outgrow
the condition,|260905004
but
this
is
generally
not
the case.|398241000

This belief
stems
from the confusion|286933003
between true strabismus|31874001|22066006
and
pseudostrabismus.|313157004

When
a child's eyes|410601007|81745001|160499008|81745001
are
truly
crossed|65145006
,
it
is
always
a serious condition|42745003|260905004
and
requires
the care
of an ophthalmologist."|422234006
[1]|260305007

Pseudostrabismus|313157004
is
more likely to|242762006|2931005
be
observed
in Native American|413490006
or
East Asian infants|414978006|418119000
due to the presence|386397008
of epicanthic fold obscuring|26310004
the medial aspect|255561001
of the eye.|81745001|244486005
