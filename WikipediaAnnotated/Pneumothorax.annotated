*
*Pneumothorax|36118008
*
*
(_pl_.

*
*pneumothoraces|36118008

)
is
an abnormal collection|263654008
of air|417696007
or
gas|308698004|74947009
in the pleural space|3120008|264148002
separating|263869007
the lung|39607008|181216001
from the chest wall|78904004|181608004
which
may
interfere|78235001
with normal breathing.|22803001

A
*
*primary pneumothorax|63161005|36118008|261424001|36118008
*
*
is
one|421379005
that
occurs|272120004
without an apparent cause|134198009
and
in the absence|2667000|418560003
of significant lung disease,|386134007|19829001
while
a
*
*secondary pneumothorax|2603003|36118008|81170007|36118008
*
*
occurs|272120004
in the presence|386397008
of pre-existing lung pathology.|236874000|39607008|394595002|236874000|181216001|394595002|272113006|39607008|394595002|272113006|181216001|394595002

Occasionally,
the amount|107651007
of air|417696007
in the chest|261179002
increases|260366006
markedly|46998006
when
a one-way valve|421379005
is
formed|35810008
by an area|42798000
of damaged tissue,|37782003
leading|236874000
to a
*
*tension pneumothorax|233645004
*
*.

This condition|260905004
is
a medical emergency|74188005|25876001
that
can
cause|23981006|134198009
steadily
worsening|230993007|231877006
oxygen shortage|24099007
and
low blood pressure.|45007003

Unless
reversed
by effective treatment,|255403003|276239002|255403003|416118004|254648000|276239002|254648000|416118004
these sequelae|302049001
can
progress|385651009
and
cause death.|134198009|419620001|134198009|268923008

Pneumothoraces|36118008
can
be
caused|23981006|134198009
by physical trauma|5880005|5880005|19388002|19388002
to the chest|261179002
(
including|55919000
blast injury,|397996002
or
as a complication|116223007|263718001
of medical|74188005
or
surgical intervention.|83578000

Symptoms typically
include|55919000
chest pain|29857009
and
shortness|359530003|367450005
of breath.|11891009

Diagnosis|439401001
of a pneumothorax|36118008
by physical examination|5880005
alone|105529008
can
be
difficult|52925006
or
inconclusive|419984006
(particularly
in smaller pneumothoraces|263796003|36118008|255507004|36118008
)
,
so
a chest X-ray|399208008
or
computed tomography (CT) scan|77477000|373205008|77477000
is
usually
used|394850002
to
confirm|59156000
its presence.|386397008

Small spontaneous pneumothoraces typically|255507004|80423007
resolve
without treatment|276239002|416118004
and
require
only monitoring.|50607009|302805002|420295001|302805002

This approach
may
be
most appropriate|4757001
in subjects
who
have
no significant underlying lung disease.|386134007|19829001

In larger pneumothoraces,|255509001|36118008|263768009|36118008
or
when
there
are
marked|46998006
signs|72670004
and/or
symptoms,
the air|417696007
may
be
extracted|62972009
with a syringe|61968008
or
a chest tube|258643002
connected
to a one-way valve system.|421379005|246333005

Occasionally,
surgical interventions|83578000
are
required
when
tube drainage|257287003
is
unsuccessful,|385671000
or
as a preventative measure,|246445000|272391002
if
there
have
been
repeated|27582007
episodes.|272128006

The surgical treatments usually|83578000
involve|248448006
pleurodesis|84572006
(
which
induce|16404004
the layers
of pleura to|3120008|181609007
stick
together
)
or
pleurectomy|23979009
(
the surgical removal|118292001|128303001|128304007
of pleural membranes|3120008|83097008|264148002|83097008
).

Primary spontaneous pneumothorax (PSP)|63161005|80423007|261424001|80423007
tends
to
occur|272120004
in young adults|84422007|133936004
without underlying lung problems,|39607008|55607006|181216001|55607006
and
usually
causes|134198009
limited signs|255469002|72670004
and
symptoms.

Chest pain|29857009
and
sometimes mild breathlessness|255604002|267036007
are
the usual predominant presenting features.|246105001

People|125676002
affected|247591002|248448006
by a primary spontaneous pneumothorax|63161005|80423007|261424001|80423007
are
often|70232002
unaware|418107008|406124004
of any potential danger|30207005
and
may
wait
several days|261028005|258703001
before seeking medical attention.|74188005|6769007

PSP
occurs|272120004
more commonly|242762006
during changes|243326001|263703002
in atmospheric pressure,|40513000
explaining
to some extent|255590007
why
episodes|272128006
of pneumothorax|36118008
may
happen
in clusters.

It
is
rare|84638005|103356009
for a PSP to
cause|23981006|134198009
a tension pneumothorax.[1]|233645004

Secondary spontaneous pneumothorax (SSP),|2603003|80423007|81170007|80423007
by definition,
occurs|272120004
in individuals|125676002|385435006
with significant underlying lung disease.|386134007|19829001

Signs|72670004
and
symptoms
in SSP
tend
to
be
more severe|242762006|24484000
than
in PSP,
as
the unaffected lung|39607008|181216001
is
generally
not capable
of replacing|370124000
the loss
of function|246464006
in the affected lung.|247591002|39607008|247591002|181216001|248448006|39607008|248448006|181216001

Hypoxemia|389087006
(decreased blood oxygen levels|1250004|87612001|24099007|258395000|1250004|119273009|24099007|258395000|260400001|87612001|24099007|258395000|260400001|119273009|24099007|258395000|260371004|87612001|24099007|258395000|260371004|119273009|24099007|258395000
)
is
usually
present|52101004|246105001
and
may
be
observed
as cyanosis|119419001
(blue discoloration|405738005|47415006
of the lips|261114002
and
skin|119325001|39937001|181469002
).

Hypercapnia|29596007
(accumulation
of carbon dioxide|421982008
in the blood|87612001|119273009
)
is
sometimes
encountered
;
this
may
cause|23981006|134198009
confusion|286933003
and
-
if
very severe -|260358002|24484000
may
result|394617004
in coma.|371632003|405809000

The sudden onset|385315009|255363002
of breathlessness|267036007
in someone
with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease,|413846005
cystic fibrosis,|190905008
or
other serious lung disease|74964007|42745003|19829001
should
therefore
prompt
investigations to|386053000
identify|7882003
the possibility
of a pneumothorax.[1][3]|36118008

Traumatic pneumothorax|90070003
occurs|272120004
most commonly
when
the chest wall|78904004|181608004
is
pierced,
such as
when
a stab wound|425322008
or
gunshot wound|283545005
allows
air to|417696007
enter|417985001
the pleural space,|3120008|264148002
or
because
some other mechanical injury|74964007|261018001
to the lung|39607008|181216001
compromises
the integrity|11163003|246224005
of the involved structures.|248448006

Traumatic pneumothoraces|90070003
have
been
found|404684003
to
occur|272120004
in
up to half
of all cases|398241000|413769002
of chest trauma,|262525000
with only rib fractures|50607009|33737001|420295001|33737001
being
a more common problem|242762006|72906007|55607006
in this group.|261586004|160481000|389109008

The pneumothorax|36118008
can
be
occult|81674002|6080000
(
not readily apparent
)
in half
of these cases,|398241000|413769002
but
may
enlarge -|260376009|118452000
particularly
if
mechanical ventilation
is
required.

They
are
also
encountered
in patients already|116154003
receiving
mechanical ventilation
for some other reason.[2]|74964007|410666004

On physical examination,|5880005
breath sounds|52653008
(audible
using|260676000
a stethoscope|53639001
may
be
diminished|1250004
on the affected side,|247591002|182353008|248448006|182353008
partly
because
air|417696007
in the pleural space|3120008|264148002
dampens
the transmission|258150004
of sound.|68325009

Measures|246445000|367346004
of the conduction|251089002|278252000
of vocal vibrations|33679000
to the surface|410678000
of the chest|261179002
may
be
altered.

Percussion|75180006
of the chest|261179002
may
be
perceived|81742003
as hyperresonant|64964006
(
like a booming drum
)
,
and
vocal resonance|79466001
and
tactile fremitus
can
both
be
noticeably
decreased.|1250004|260400001|260371004

Importantly,
the volume|118565006|419569009
of the pneumothorax|36118008
can
show
limited correlation|255469002
with the intensity|103370009
of the symptoms
experienced
by the victim,
[3]|260313008
and
physical signs|72670004
may
not
be
apparent
if
the pneumothorax|36118008
is
relatively small.[2][3]|255507004

Although
multiple definitions|260396001
exist
,
a tension pneumothorax|233645004
is
generally
considered
to
be
present|52101004|246105001
when
a pneumothorax|36118008
leads|88488004|236874000
to significant impairment|386134007|40226000
of respiration|258162000
or
blood circulation.|87612001|413854007|119273009|413854007

The most common findings|4757001|72906007|404684003|4757001|72906007
in people|125676002
with tension pneumothorax|233645004
are
chest pain|29857009
and
respiratory distress,|271825005
often|70232002
with an increased heart rate|3424008
(tachycardia|3424008|6285003
and
rapid breathing|271823003
(tachypnea|271823003
in the initial stages.|884001|261612004|232714002|261612004

Other findings|74964007|404684003|74964007
may
include|55919000
quieter breath sounds|255357006|52653008
on one side|66459002
of the chest,|261179002
low oxygen levels|62482003|24099007|258395000|371880002|24099007|258395000
and
blood pressure,|75367002|392570002|386536003
and
displacement|286668001|263739008|276626008
of the trachea away|44567001|181213009
from the affected side.|247591002|182353008|248448006|182353008

Rarely,|103356009
there
may
be
cyanosis|119419001
(bluish discoloration|47415006
of the skin|119325001|39937001|181469002
due to low oxygen levels|62482003|24099007|258395000|371880002|24099007|258395000
)
,
altered level|258395000|276625007
of consciousness,|106167005
a hyperresonant percussion note|64964006
on examination|5880005
of the affected side|247591002|182353008|248448006|182353008
with hyperexpansion|73578008
and
decreased movement,|1250004|255324009|260400001|255324009|260371004|255324009
pain|22253000
in the epigastrium|27947004
(upper abdomen|279026008|80581009
)
,
displacement|286668001|263739008|276626008
of the apex beat|68031002
(heart impulse|80891009|263781002|302509004|263781002
)
,
and
resonant sound|300843007|300843007|68325009
when
tapping
the sternum.|56873002|302522007

This
is
a medical emergency|74188005|25876001
and
may
require
immediate treatment|88694003|276239002|88694003|416118004|49499008|276239002|49499008|416118004
without further investigations|46053002|386053000
(
see|281004000
below
).[3][4]|260279004

Tension pneumothorax|233645004
may
also
occur|272120004
in those receiving mechanical ventilation,
in which case|398241000
it
may
be
difficult to|52925006
spot|23840004
as the person|125676002
is
typically
receiving
sedation|72641008
;
it
is
often|70232002
noted
because of a sudden deterioration|255363002
in condition.|260905004

Recent studies|6493001|110465008|6493001|224699009
have
shown
that
the development|278923009
of tension features|53489000
may
not always
be
as rapid|255358001
as
previously
thought.|88952004

Deviation|263739008|40885006
of the trachea|44567001|181213009
(windpipe|44567001
)
to one side|66459002
and
the presence|386397008
of raised jugular venous pressure|22447003
(distended neck veins|8804002|45048000|8804002|302550007|255381004|82121006
)
are
not reliable
as clinical signs.[4]|58147004|72670004

Spontaneous pneumothoraces|80423007
are
divided|422033008
into two types|420797005|261664005
:
_primary_,|63161005|261424001
which
occurs|272120004
in the absence|2667000|418560003
of known lung disease,|36692007|19829001
and
_secondary_,|2603003|81170007
which
occurs|272120004
in someone
with underlying lung disease.|19829001

The exact cause|134198009
of primary spontaneous pneumothorax|63161005|80423007|261424001|80423007
is
unknown|261665006
,
but
established risk factors|263748003|80943009|385645004|80943009
include|55919000
male sex,|248153007
smoking|365981007
,
and
a family history|57177007
of pneumothorax.|36118008

The various suspected underlying mechanisms|256220008|257544000|256220008|415684004|257544000
are
discussed
below.[1][2]|303183002

Secondary spontaneous pneumothorax|2603003|80423007|81170007|80423007
occurs|272120004
in the setting
of a variety
of lung diseases.|19829001

The most common|4757001|72906007
is
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease,|413846005
which
accounts
for approximately 70%|26175008
of cases.|398241000|413769002

Known lung diseases|36692007|19829001
that
may
significantly
increase|260366006
the risk|30207005
for pneumothorax|36118008
are
:

In children,|410601007|160499008
additional causes|260364009|134198009
include|55919000
measles,|14189004
echinococcosis,|74942003
inhalation|14910006|422237004
of a foreign body,|125670008
and
certain congenital malformations|17162000|276654001
(congenital cystic adenomatoid malformation|111318005
and
congenital lobar emphysema.[6]|66987001

11.5%
of people|125676002
with a spontaneous pneumothorax|80423007
have
a family member|303071001
who
has
experienced
a pneumothorax previously.|36118008

The hereditary conditions Marfan's syndrome,|255404009|260905004|19346006
homocystinuria,|11282001
Ehlers?Danlos syndrome,|398114001
alpha 1-antitrypsin deficiency|30188007
(
which
leads|88488004|236874000
to emphysema|49158009|87433001
)
,
and
Birt?Hogg?Dub? syndrome
have
all
been
linked
with familial pneumothorax.|35359004|36118008|255401001|36118008

Generally,
these conditions|260905004
cause|23981006|134198009
other signs|74964007|72670004
and
symptoms
as well,|20572008
and
pneumothorax|36118008
is
not usually
the primary finding.|63161005|404684003|63161005|261424001|404684003|261424001

Birt?Hogg?Dub? syndrome
is
caused|23981006|134198009
by mutations|55446002
in the _FLCN_ gene|67271001
(
located
at chromosome 17p11.2|113354003
)
,
which
encodes
a protein|88878007
named|27468005
folliculin.|51775003|104657002

_FLCN_ mutations|55446002
and
lung lesions|301232003
have
also
been
identified|7882003
in familial cases|35359004|398241000|35359004|413769002|255401001|398241000|255401001|413769002
of pneumothorax|36118008
where other features|74964007
of Birt?Hogg?Dub? syndrome
are
absent.|2667000

In addition|260364009
to the aforementioned genetic associations,|3950001|263534001|255395001|263534001
the HLA haplotype A2B40|47038001
is
also
a genetic predisposition|47708004
to PSP.[8][9]

A traumatic pneumothorax|90070003
may
result|394617004
from
either
blunt trauma|425359009
or
penetrating injury|262560006
to the chest wall.|78904004|181608004

The most common mechanism|4757001|72906007|257544000
is
due to sharp bony points|410707003|263686003
at a new rib fracture penetrating pleura|7147002|33737001|53568006|3120008|7147002|33737001|53568006|181609007
and
damaging lung tissue.|113255004

Traumatic pneumothorax|90070003
may
also
be
observed
in those
exposed|24932003
to an explosive blast,|66113009|90391002
even
if
no visible injury|24054004
to the chest|261179002
is
apparent.[10]

Medical procedures|50731006
of the chest,|261179002
such as the insertion|71861002|257867005
of a central venous catheter|52124006
into one|421379005
of the chest veins|38809004|206486005|75912008
or
the taking
of biopsy samples|258415003
from lung tissue,|113255004
may
lead|88488004
to pneumothorax.|36118008

The administration|413454004|416118004
of positive pressure ventilation,|182687005|250854009
either
mechanical ventilation
or
non-invasive ventilation,|22762002|258162000|22762002|45444009
can
result|394617004
in barotrauma|406445001|257548002
(pressure-related injury|125665001|272151006|125665001|262094002
)
leading|236874000
to a pneumothorax.[2]|36118008

Divers|308367006
who
breathe|14910006|258162000
from an underwater apparatus
are
supplied|425398004
with breathing gas|14910006|308698004|14910006|74947009|258162000|308698004|258162000|74947009
at ambient pressure,|279046003|13543005|257893003
which
results|394617004
in their lungs|39607008
containing|42504009
gas|308698004|74947009
at higher|75540009|371879000
than atmospheric pressure.|40513000

Divers|308367006
breathing|14910006|258162000
compressed air|2275002
(
such as
when
scuba diving|63498000
may
suffer
a pneumothorax|36118008
as a result|394617004
of barotrauma|406445001|257548002
from ascending just 1 metre|79458005|258669008
(3 ft)|260313008
while
breath-holding|90480005
with their lungs fully|39607008
inflated.

An additional problem|260364009|55607006
in these cases|398241000|413769002
is
that
those
with other features|74964007
of decompression sickness|89684003
are
typically
treated|28995006
in a diving chamber|63498000
with hyperbaric therapy|18678000
;
this
can
lead|88488004
to a small pneumothorax rapidly enlarging|255507004|36118008|418694008|260376009
and
causing features|23981006
of tension.[11]|53489000

The thoracic cavity|43799004|243949006
is
the space
inside the chest|261179002
that
contains|42504009
the lungs,|39607008
heart|80891009|302509004
and
a number|410680006|410681005
of major blood vessels.|255603008|59820001

On each side|182353008
of the cavity,|80967001|91806002|2483006
a pleural membrane|3120008|83097008|264148002|83097008
covers|255334000
the surface|410678000
of lung|39607008|181216001
(visceral pleura|81623005
and
also
lines|50009006
the
inside of the chest wall|78904004|181608004
(parietal pleura.|80338007

Normally,
the two layers|420797005
are
separated|13184001|263869007
only
by a small amount|255507004|107651007
of lubricating serous fluid.

The lungs|39607008
are
fully
inflated
within the cavity|80967001|91806002|2483006
because
the pressure|279046003|13543005|257893003
inside the airways|43725001|89187006
is
higher|75540009|371879000
than the pressure|279046003|13543005|257893003
inside the pleural space.|3120008|264148002

Despite the low pressure|62482003|279046003|62482003|13543005|62482003|257893003|371880002|279046003|371880002|13543005|371880002|257893003
in the pleural space,|3120008|264148002
air|417696007
does
not
enter|417985001
it because there
are
no natural connections|510009|263538003
to an air-containing passage,|417696007|42504009|255592004
and
the pressure|279046003|13543005|257893003
of gases|74947009
in the bloodstream
is
too low|62482003|371880002
for them to
be
forced|263760002
into the pleural space.|3120008|264148002

Therefore,
a pneumothorax|36118008
can
only
develop
if air|417696007
is
allowed to
enter|417985001
,
through damage|37782003
to the chest wall|78904004|181608004
or
damage|37782003
to the lung|39607008|181216001
itself,
or
occasionally
because
microorganisms|264395009
in the pleural space|3120008|264148002
produce
gas.[2]|308698004|74947009

Chest wall defects|78904004|6920004|181608004|6920004
are
usually evident|18669006
in cases|398241000|413769002
of injury
to the chest wall,|78904004|181608004
such as stab|242879005
or
bullet wounds|86122002|13924000
("open pneumothorax"|15206007
).

In secondary spontaneous pneumothoraces,|2603003|80423007|81170007|80423007
vulnerabilities
in the lung tissue|113255004
are
caused|23981006|134198009
by a variety
of disease processes,|64572001|415178003
particularly
by rupturing|415747007|263862003
of bullae|408764000
(large air-containing lesions|255509001|417696007|42504009
)
in cases|398241000|413769002
of severe emphysema.|24484000|49158009|24484000|87433001

Areas|42798000
of necrosis|6574001
(tissue death|6574001
)
may
precipitate
episodes|272128006
of pneumothorax,|36118008
although
the exact mechanism|257544000
is
unclear.

Primary spontaneous pneumothorax|63161005|80423007|261424001|80423007
has
for many years|258707000
been
thought|88952004
to
be
caused|23981006|134198009
by "blebs"|408764000
(small air-filled lesions just|255507004|417696007
under the pleural surface|3120008|410678000|264148002|410678000
)
,
which
were
presumed
to
be
more common|242762006|72906007
in those classically at risk|30207005
of pneumothorax|36118008
(tall males|188729005|248153007|277575008|248153007
)
due to mechanical factors.|261018001

Various lines|256220008|50009006
of evidence|18669006
suggest
that
this hypothesis
may
not
be
sufficient to|51117008
explain
all episodes|272128006
of primary spontaneous pneumothorax,|63161005|80423007|261424001|80423007
such as the fact
that pneumothorax|36118008
may
recur|246455001
even
after surgical treatment|83578000
of blebs,|408764000
and
that blebs|408764000
occur|272120004
in 15%
of healthy people.|263775005|125676002

It
has
therefore
been
suggested
that PSP
may
also
be
caused|23981006|134198009
by areas|42798000
of disruption|76555007
(porosity
)
in the pleural layer,|3120008|264148002
which
are
prone to|1240000
rupture.|415747007

Smoking|365981007
may
additionally
lead|88488004
to inflammation|257552002
and
obstruction|26036001
of small airways,|255507004|43725001|255507004|89187006
accounting
for the markedly increased risk|46998006|35105006|30207005|46998006|260366006|30207005
of PSP
in smokers.|77176002

Once air|417696007
has
stopped|385654001
entering|417985001
the pleural cavity,|91381003
it
is
gradually
resorbed
spontaneously.[3]

Tension pneumothorax|233645004
occurs|272120004
when
the opening|56116003
that
allows
air to|417696007
enter|417985001
the pleural space|3120008|264148002
functions|246464006
as a one way valve,|421379005
allowing
more air to|242762006|417696007
enter|417985001
with every breath|11891009
and
but
not to
escape.

The body|279495008|123037004
compensates|17275008
by increasing|260369004
the respiratory rate|86290005
and
tidal volume|13621006
(size|277049003
of each breath|11891009
)
,
worsening|230993007|231877006
the problem.|55607006

Unless
corrected|370975003
,
hypoxia|389086002
(decreased oxygen levels|1250004|24099007|258395000|260400001|24099007|258395000|260371004|24099007|258395000
)
and
respiratory arrest eventually|248583008|87317003
follow.[4]|367409002|421939007

The symptoms
of pneumothorax|36118008
can
be
vague|25615006
and
inconclusive, especially|419984006
in those with a small PSP,|20401003|255507004|421463005|255507004
and
confirmation|74996004
with medical imaging|278395004
is
usually
required.

In contrast,
tension pneumothorax|233645004
is
a medical emergency|74188005|25876001
and
may
be
treated|28995006
before|236874000|421718005
imaging -|363679005|278395004
especially
if
there
is
severe hypoxia,|24484000|389086002
very low blood pressure,|260358002|45007003
or
an impaired level|260379002|258395000|260379002|276625007|40226000|258395000|40226000|276625007
of consciousness.|106167005

In tension pneumothorax,|233645004
X-rays|52250000|168537006
are
sometimes
required
if there
is
doubt
about the anatomical location|36298004|246267002
of the pneumothorax.[4][5]|36118008

Traditionally
a plain radiograph|168537006
of the chest,|261179002
ideally
with the X-ray beams|52250000|168537006|363680008
being
projected
from the back|123961009|255551008|281213008|302552004|77568009
(posteroanterior,
or
"PA"
)
,
has
been
the most appropriate first investigation.|4757001|255216001|386053000|4757001|232714002|386053000

These
are
usually
performed|398166005
during maximal inspiration|56851009|14910006|398303009|14910006
(holding one's breath|90480005|421379005
)
;
no added information
is
gathered
by obtaining|398092000
a chest X-ray|399208008
in expiration|58322009
(
after exhaling|58322009
).

If
the PA X-ray|52250000|168537006|363680008
does
not
show
a pneumothorax|36118008
but
there
is
a strong suspicion|260404005|22927000
of one,|421379005
lateral X-rays|49370004|49370004|52250000|49370004|168537006
(
with beams
projecting
from the side|182353008
)
may
be
performed|398166005
,
but
this
is
not routine practice.|50811001

It
is
not unusual
for the mediastinum|264099006|94931004|181217005
(
the structure
between the lungs|39607008
that
contains|42504009
the heart,|80891009|302509004
great blood vessels|3711007|340772002
and
large airways|255509001|43725001|255509001|89187006
)
to
be
shifted|9546005
away
from the affected lung|247591002|39607008|247591002|181216001|248448006|39607008|248448006|181216001
due to the pressure differences.|279046003|263735002|13543005|263735002|257893003|263735002

This
is
*
*
not
*
* equivalent|9726003|258726008
to a tension pneumothorax,|233645004
which
is
determined mainly
by the constellation
of symptoms,
hypoxia,|389086002
and
shock.[2]|27942005

The size|277049003
of the pneumothorax|36118008
(i.e.|42146005|22971001

the volume|118565006|419569009
of air|417696007
in the pleural space|3120008|264148002
)
can
be
determined
with a reasonable degree|410666004|258395000|410666004|246173007
of accuracy|263656005
by measuring|258104002|263571004
the distance|246132006
between the chest wall|78904004|181608004
and
the lung.|39607008|181216001

This
is
relevant
to treatment,|276239002|416118004
as
smaller pneumothoraces|263796003|36118008|255507004|36118008
may
be
managed|119270007
differently.

An air rim|417696007
of 2 cm means|260306008|255586005
that
the pneumothorax occupies|36118008
about 50%
of the hemithorax.|422614002

British professional guidelines
have
traditionally
stated|398070004
that
the measurement|272391002
should
be
performed|398166005
at the level|258395000|276625007
of the hilum
(
where blood vessels|59820001
and
airways|43725001|89187006
enter|417985001
the lung|39607008|181216001
)
with 2 cm|260306008
as the cutoff,
[3]|260313008
while
American guidelines
state|398070004
that
the measurement|272391002
should
be
done
at the apex|255414000
(top)|421812003
of the lung|39607008|181216001
with 3 cm|260313008
differentiating|263933003
between a "small"|255507004
and
a "large" pneumothorax.|255509001|36118008

The latter method|260686004|272394005
may
overestimate
the size|277049003
of a pneumothorax|36118008
if
it
is
located mainly
at the apex,|255414000
which
is
a common occurrence.|72906007|272120004

The various methods|256220008|260686004|256220008|272394005
correlate
poorly,|556001
but
are
the best easily available ways|20572008|36203004|103328004|3442003|36203004|103328004
of estimating pneumothorax size.|414135002|36118008|277049003

CT scanning|77477000
(
see|281004000
below
)
can
provide
a more accurate determination|242762006|263656005
of the size|277049003
of the pneumothorax,|36118008
but
its routine use|50811001|277889008|50811001|419385000
in this setting
is
not
recommended.[12]

Not
all pneumothoraces|36118008
are
uniform|27617004
;
some only|50607009|420295001
form|246176004
a pocket
of air|417696007
in a particular place|257557008|421066005
in the chest.|261179002

Small amounts|255507004|107651007
of fluid|32457005|33463005|255765007
may
be
noted
on the chest X-ray|399208008
(hydropneumothorax|65933003
;
this
may
be
blood|87612001|119273009
(hemopneumothorax.|16632002

In some cases,|398241000|413769002
the only significant abnormality|50607009|386134007|276654001|420295001|386134007|276654001
may
be
the "deep sulcus sign",|131197000|72670004
in which
the normally small space|255507004
between the chest wall|78904004|181608004
and
the diaphragm|263734003|336704008|181614006
appears
enlarged|260376009|118452000
due to the abnormal presence|43261007
of fluid.[4]|32457005|33463005|255765007

Computed tomography|77477000
(CT,
or
"CAT scan"|77477000
)
can
be
useful
in particular situations.

In some lung diseases,|19829001
especially emphysema,|49158009|87433001
it
is
possible|371930009|60022001
for abnormal lung areas|263654008|10418003|263654008|204510006
such as bullae|408764000
(large air-filled sacs|255509001|49081009
)
to
have
the same appearance|262126009|386548000|262126009|255412001
as a pneumothorax|36118008
on chest X-ray,|399208008
and
it
may
not
be
safe to
apply|410618006|417924000
any treatment|276239002|416118004
before the distinction
is
made
and
before the exact location|246267002
and
size|277049003
of the pneumothorax|36118008
is
determined.

In trauma,
where
it
may
not
be
possible to|371930009|60022001
perform|398166005
an upright film,
chest radiography|399208008
may
miss
up to a third|70905002
of pneumothoraces,|36118008
while
CT
remains
very sensitive.[5]|260358002|83185005

A further use|46053002|277889008|46053002|419385000
of CT
is
in the identification|286672002|7882003
of underlying lung lesions.|301232003

In presumed primary pneumothorax,|63161005|36118008|261424001|36118008
it
may
help
to
identify|7882003
blebs|408764000
or
cystic lesions|441457006|20476009
(
in anticipation
of treatment,|276239002|416118004
see|281004000
below
)
,
and
in secondary pneumothorax|2603003|36118008|81170007|36118008
it
can
help
to
identify|7882003
most
of the causes|134198009
listed
above.[3][6]|261183002

Ultrasound|359659005
is
commonly
used|394850002
in the evaluation|386053000
of people|125676002
who
have
sustained|263892007
physical trauma,|5880005|5880005|19388002|19388002
for example
with the FAST protocol.|16985007|258049002|277748003|258049002

Ultrasound|359659005
may
be
more sensitive|242762006|83185005
than chest X-rays|399208008
in the identification|286672002|7882003
of pneumothorax|36118008
after blunt trauma|425359009
to the chest.|261179002

Ultrasound|359659005
may
also
provide
a rapid diagnosis|255358001|439401001|255358001
in other emergency situations,|74964007|25876001
and
allow
the quantification
of the size|277049003
of the pneumothorax.|36118008

Several particular features|261028005
on ultrasonography|359659005
of the chest|261179002
can
be
used|394850002
to
confirm|59156000
or
exclude|77765009
the diagnosis.[15]|439401001

The treatment|276239002|416118004
of pneumothorax|36118008
depends
on a number|410680006|410681005
of factors,
and
may
vary
from discharge|307488001|58000006
with early follow-up|264499004|308273005
to immediate needle decompression|88694003|79068005|19484001|88694003|79068005|424128006|88694003|79068005|281613004|49499008|79068005|19484001|49499008|79068005|424128006|49499008|79068005|281613004
or
insertion|71861002|257867005
of a chest tube.|258643002

Treatment|276239002|416118004
is
determined
by the severity|272141005
of symptoms
and
indicators
of acute illness,|272118002|39104002
the presence|386397008
of underlying lung disease,|19829001
the estimated size|414135002|277049003
of the pneumothorax|36118008
on X-ray,|52250000|168537006|363680008
and
-
in some instances -
on the personal preference|225773000
of the person|125676002
involved.[3]|248448006

In traumatic pneumothorax,|90070003
chest tubes|258643002
are
usually
inserted.|257867005

If mechanical ventilation
is
required,
the risk|30207005
of tension pneumothorax|233645004
is
greatly
increased|35105006|260366006
and
the insertion|71861002|257867005
of a chest tube|258643002
is
mandatory.

Any open chest wound|127314000
should
be
covered|255334000
with an airtight seal,|19314006|106980009
as
it
carries|288345009
a high risk|15508007
of
leading|236874000
to tension pneumothorax.|233645004

Ideally,
a dressing|333453004|3895009|165235000|129003000
called
the "Asherman
seal"|19314006|106980009
should
be
utilized
,
as
it
appears
to
be
more effective|242762006|255403003|242762006|254648000
than a standard "three-sided" dressing.|421291004|182353008|333453004|421291004|182353008|3895009|421291004|182353008|165235000|421291004|182353008|129003000

The Asherman seal|19314006|106980009
is
a specially designed device|303607000|49062001
that
adheres|102491009
to the chest wall|78904004|181608004
and
,
through a valve-
like mechanism,|257544000
allows
air to|417696007
escape
but
not to
enter|417985001
the chest.[17]|261179002

Tension pneumothorax|233645004
is
usually
treated|28995006
with urgent needle decompression.|103391001|79068005|19484001|103391001|79068005|424128006|103391001|79068005|281613004

This
may
be
required
before transport|57188001|360300001
to the hospital,|285201006
and
can
be
performed|398166005
by an emergency medical technician|397897005
or
other trained professional.|74964007|118629009|74964007|62193008

The needle|79068005
or
cannula|12150006
is
left|7771000
in place|257557008|421066005
until a chest tube|258643002
can
be
inserted.|257867005

If tension pneumothorax|233645004
leads|88488004|236874000
to cardiac arrest,|397829000
needle decompression|79068005|19484001|79068005|424128006|79068005|281613004
is
performed|398166005
as part|260726005
of resuscitation|439569004
as
it
may
restore
cardiac output.[18]|82799009

Small spontaneous pneumothoraces|255507004|80423007
do
not always
require
treatment,|276239002|416118004
as
they
are
unlikely to
proceed
to respiratory failure|409622000
or
tension pneumothorax,|233645004
and
generally
resolve
spontaneously.

This approach
is
most appropriate|4757001
if
the estimated size|414135002|277049003
of the pneumothorax|36118008
is
small|255507004
(
defined
as
<50%
of the volume|118565006|419569009
of the hemithorax|422614002
)
,
there
is
no breathlessness,|267036007
and
there
is
no underlying lung disease.|19829001

It
may
be
appropriate to
treat|395077000
a larger PSP conservatively|255509001|263768009
if
the symptoms
are
limited.|255469002

Admission|32485007
to hospital|285201006
is
often|70232002
not
required
,
as long|255511005
as clear instructions|263707001|409073007
are
given|419582001
to
return|7528007
to hospital|285201006
if
there
are
worsening symptoms.|230993007|231877006

Further investigations|46053002|386053000
may
be
performed|398166005
as an outpatient,|373864002
at which time X-rays|410669006|410669006|52250000|410669006|168537006
are
repeated|27582007
to
confirm|59156000
improvement,
and
advice|420227002
given|419582001
with regard
to preventing recurrence|246455001|116699007|246455001
(
see|281004000
below
).

Estimated rates|414135002
of resorption
are
between 1.25%|260305007
and
2.2%|260306008
the volume|118565006|419569009
of the cavity|80967001|91806002|2483006
per day.|258703001|259032004

This
would
mean|255586005
that even
a complete pneumothorax|255594003|36118008
would
spontaneously
resolve
over a period|259037005
of about 6 weeks.[3]|258705008

Secondary pneumothoraces|2603003|36118008|81170007|36118008
are
only
treated conservatively|28995006
if
the size|277049003
is
very small|260358002|255507004
(1 cm|260305007
or
less air rim|276139006|417696007|263796003|417696007
)
and
there
are
limited|255469002
symptoms.

Admission|32485007
to the hospital|285201006
is
usually
recommended.

Oxygen|24099007
given|419582001
at a high flow rate|75540009|371879000
may
accelerate|14355007
resorption
as
much
as
fourfold.[3][19]

In a large primary spontaneous pneumothorax|255509001|63161005|80423007|255509001|261424001|80423007
(
>50%
)
,
or
PSP
associated|47429007
with breathlessness,|267036007
some professional guidelines
recommend
that reducing|260400001
the size|277049003
by aspiration|14910006|278847003|129316008|68052005
is
equally effective|255403003|254648000
as the insertion|71861002|257867005
of a chest tube.|258643002

This
involves|248448006
the administration|413454004|416118004
of local anesthetic|386761002|373477003
and
inserting|257867005|421532009
a needle|79068005
connected
to a three-way tap|421291004|86088003
;
up to 2.5 liters|264655001|258770004
of air|417696007
(
in adults|133936004
)
are
removed.|127485006

If
there
has
been
significant reduction|386134007|58294000|386134007|260400001|386134007|289928003
in the size|277049003
of the pneumothorax|36118008
on subsequent X-ray,|255260001|255260001|52250000|255260001|168537006|255260001|363680008
the remainder
of the treatment|276239002|416118004
can
be
conservative.

This approach
has
been
shown
to
be
effective|255403003|254648000
in over 50%|21481007
of cases.|398241000|413769002

Compared
to tube drainage,|257287003
first-line aspiration|50009006|14910006|50009006|278847003|50009006|129316008|50009006|68052005
in PSP
reduces|260400001
the number|410680006|410681005
of people|125676002
requiring
hospital admission significantly,|32485007
without increasing|260369004
the risk|30207005
of complications.[20]|116223007

Aspiration|14910006|278847003|129316008|68052005
may
also
be
considered
in secondary pneumothorax|2603003|36118008|81170007|36118008
of moderate size|6736007|277049003
(air rim 1?2 cm|417696007
)
without breathlessness,|267036007
with the difference|263735002
that ongoing observation|255238004|103705002
in hospital|285201006
is
required even
after a successful procedure.|385669000|71388002

American professional guidelines
state|398070004
that
*
*
all
*
* large pneumothoraces - even|255509001|36118008
those
due to PSP -
should
be
treated|28995006

sized|277049003
iatrogenic traumatic pneumothoraces|441536000|263904004|255405005|90070003
(
due to medical procedures|50731006
)
may
initially|884001
be
treated|28995006
with aspiration.[2]|14910006|278847003|129316008|68052005

A chest tube|258643002
(
or
intercostal drain|303481006
)
is
the most definitive initial treatment|4757001|261002007|884001|276239002|4757001|261002007|884001|416118004|4757001|261002007|232714002|276239002|4757001|261002007|232714002|416118004
of a pneumothorax.|36118008

These
are
typically
inserted|257867005
in an area|42798000
under the axilla|422543003|361288001|362732006
(armpit|422543003|361288001

called
the "safe triangle",|27237009
where
damage|37782003

an advantage.

In traumatic pneumothorax,|90070003
larger tubes|255509001|83059008|255509001|418530008|263768009|83059008|263768009|418530008
(28 F,|372639009

are
used.[17]|394850002

Chest tubes|258643002
are
required
in PSP
that
have
not
responded
to needle aspiration,|79068005|14910006|79068005|278847003|79068005|129316008|79068005|68052005
in any SSP
that
is
large|255509001
(
>50%
)
,
and
in cases|398241000|413769002
of tension pneumothorax.|233645004

They
are
connected
to a one-way valve system|421379005|246333005
that
allows
air to|417696007
escape
,
but
not to
re-enter|228877007|417985001
,
the chest.|261179002

This
may
include|55919000
a bottle|68276009|419672006
with water|11713004|119318008
that functions|246464006
like a water seal,|11713004|19314006|11713004|106980009|119318008|19314006|119318008|106980009
or
a Heimlich valve.

They
are
not normally
connected
to a negative pressure circuit,|260385009|279046003|260385009|13543005|260385009|257893003
as
this
would
result|394617004
in rapid re-expansion|255358001|228877007
of the lung|39607008|181216001
and
a risk|30207005
of pulmonary edema|19242006
("re-expansion pulmonary edema"|228877007|19242006
).

The tube|83059008
is
left|7771000
in place|257557008|421066005
until no air|417696007
is
seen to
escape
from it
for a period|259037005
of time,|410669006
and
X-rays|52250000|168537006
confirm|59156000
re-expansion|228877007
of the lung.[3][6][12]|39607008|181216001

If
after 2?4 days there|260306008|258703001
is
still evidence|18669006
of an air leak,|417696007|87952002
various options|256220008
are
available.|103328004

Negative pressure suction|260385009|279046003|274441001|260385009|13543005|274441001|260385009|257893003|274441001

of ?10
to ?20 cmH2O|259019009
at a high flow rate|75540009|371879000
may
be
attempted
,
particularly
in PSP
;
it
is
thought|88952004
that
this
may
accelerate|14355007
the healing|298005009|90910008
of the leak.|87952002

Failing
this,
surgery|83578000
may
be
required
,
especially
in SSP.[3]

Chest tubes|258643002
are
used|394850002
first-line|255216001|50009006|232714002|50009006
when
pneumothorax|36118008
occurs|272120004
in people|125676002
with AIDS,|62479008
usually
due to underlying pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP),|415125002
as
this condition|260905004
is
associated|47429007
with prolonged air leakage.|255224006|38785003

Bilateral pneumothorax|51440002|36118008
(pneumothorax|36118008
on
both
sides|182353008
)
is
relatively common|72906007
in people|125676002
with pneumocystis pneumonia,|415125002
and
surgery|83578000
is
often|70232002
required.[3]

Pleurodesis|84572006
is
a procedure|71388002
that permanently
obliterates
the pleural space|3120008|264148002
and
attaches|102491009
the lung|39607008|181216001
to the chest wall.|78904004|181608004

The best results|394617004
are
achieved
with a thoracotomy|367408005
(surgical opening|83578000|56116003
of the chest|261179002
)?
with identification|286672002|7882003
of any source|260753009
of air leakage|38785003
and
stapling|50015006|122868007
of blebs?|408764000
followed|367409002
by pleurectomy|23979009
(stripping|2677003
of the pleural lining|3120008|50009006|264148002|50009006
)
of the outer pleural layer|261074009|3120008|261074009|264148002
and
pleural abrasion|359972009
(scraping|56757003
of the pleura|3120008|181609007
)
of the inner layer.|260521003

During the healing process,|298005009|415178003|90910008|415178003
the lung|39607008|181216001
adheres|102491009
to the chest wall,|78904004|181608004
effectively
obliterating
the pleural space.|3120008|264148002

Recurrence rates|246455001
are
approximately 1%.[1][3]|26175008

A less invasive approach|276139006|10179008|263796003|10179008
is
thoracoscopy,|14671001
usually
in the form|246176004
of a procedure|71388002
called
video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS).|257194007|371152001|83578000

The results|394617004
from VATS-based pleural abrasion|223682000|359972009|223682000|418836005|359972009
are
slightly worse|425404009|230993007|425404009|390772001|425404009|231877006
than those
achieved
using|260676000
thoracotomy,|367408005
but
produce
smaller scars|263796003|70582006|263796003|275322007|255507004|70582006|255507004|275322007
in the skin.|119325001|39937001|181469002

Compared
to
open|56116003
thoracotomy,|367408005
VATS|223682000
offers|410527000
a shorter|359530003|367450005
in-hospital stays,|285201006
less
need|410525008|103325001
for postoperative pain control,|213299007|31509003|262061000|278414003|262061000|225782006
and
a reduced risk|260400001|30207005
of lung problems|39607008|55607006|181216001|55607006
after surgery.|83578000

VATS|223682000
may
be
also
be
used|394850002
to
achieve
chemical pleurodesis|54786002
;
this
involves|248448006
insufflation|68641000
of talc,|409109009
which
activates
an inflammatory reaction|257552002
that
causes|134198009
the lung to|39607008|181216001
adhere|102491009
to the chest wall.[1][3]|78904004|181608004

If
a chest tube|258643002
is
already
in place,|257557008|421066005
various agents|256220008|260872001
may
be
instilled|421538008
through the tube to|83059008
achieve
chemical pleurodesis,|54786002
specifically talc|409109009
or
the antibiotic tetracycline.|255631004|372809001|255631004|16355005|255631004|282831004

Results|394617004
of chemical pleurodesis|54786002
tend
to
be
worse|230993007|390772001|231877006
than
when
using|260676000
surgical approaches,|424876005
[1][3]|260305007
but
talc pleurodesis|302450005
has
been
found|404684003
to
have
few negative long-term consequences|57176003|260385009|103332005
in younger people.[1]|84422007|125676002

If pneumothorax|36118008
occurs|272120004
in a smoker,|77176002
this
is
considered
an opportunity to
emphasize
the markedly increased risk|46998006|35105006|30207005|46998006|260366006|30207005
of recurrence|246455001
in those
who
continue|255238004
to
smoke|64197008|102407002
,
and
the many benefits|260396001
of smoking cessation.

It
may
be
advisable
for someone to
remain
off work|261041009
for
up to a week|258705008|259038000
after a spontaneous pneumothorax.|80423007

If
the person normally|125676002
performs|398166005
heavy manual labor,|410712002|87982008|289909005|410712002|87982008|261041009
several weeks|261028005|258705008
may
be
required.

Those
who
have
undergone pleurodesis|84572006
may
need|410525008|103325001
two|420797005
to three weeks|421291004|258705008
off work to|261041009
recover.[21]|74822006

Air travel|417696007|420008001
is
discouraged
for
up to seven days|420359007|258703001
after complete resolution|255594003
of a pneumothorax|36118008
if
recurrence|246455001
does
not
occur.|272120004

Underwater diving|63498000
is
considered unsafe
after an episode|272128006
of pneumothorax|36118008
unless
a preventative procedure|71388002
has
been
performed.|398166005

Professional guidelines
suggest
that pleurectomy|23979009
be
performed|398166005
on
both
lungs|39607008
and
that lung function tests
and
CT scan normalize|77477000
before diving|63498000
is
resumed.

Aircraft pilots|308040008
may
also
require
assessment|386053000
for surgery.[3]|83578000

A preventative procedure|71388002
(thoracotomy|367408005
or
thoracoscopy|14671001
with pleurodesis|84572006
)
may
be
recommended
after an episode|272128006
of pneumothorax,|36118008
with the intention to|367565008|361269008
prevent
recurrence.|246455001

Evidence|18669006
on the most effective treatment|4757001|255403003|276239002|4757001|255403003|416118004|4757001|254648000|276239002|4757001|254648000|416118004
is
still
conflicting|15863006
in some areas,|42798000
and
there
is
variation|40885006
between treatments|276239002
available|103328004
in Europe|223502009
and
the US.

Not
all episodes|272128006
of pneumothorax|36118008
require
such interventions|225334002
;
the decision
depends
largely
on estimation|414135002
of the risk|30207005
of recurrence.|246455001

These procedures|71388002
are
often|70232002
recommended
after the occurrence|272120004
of a second pneumothorax.|81170007|36118008|257997001|36118008|288495006|36118008

Surgery|83578000
may
need|410525008|103325001
to
be
considered
if
someone
has
experienced pneumothorax|36118008
on
both
sides|182353008

The annual age-adjusted incidence rate (AAIR)|53281000|424144002|410617001

in those with secondary pneumothoraces.[1]|20401003|2603003|36118008|20401003|81170007|36118008|421463005|2603003|36118008|421463005|81170007|36118008

An early description|264499004
of traumatic pneumothorax|90070003
secondary|2603003|81170007
to rib fractures|33737001
appears
in _Imperial Surgery_|83578000
by Turkish surgeon ?erafeddin Sabuncuo?lu|304292004|115683008|304292004|223669008
(1385?1468
)
,
which also
recommends
a method|260686004|272394005
of simple aspiration.[28]|13673007|14910006|13673007|278847003|13673007|129316008|13673007|68052005

Pneumothorax|36118008
was
described
in 1803
by Jean Marc Gaspard Itard,|228210008
a student|65853000
of Ren?|64033007
Laennec,
who
provided
an extensive description|41118005
of the clinical picture|58147004|257444003|58147004|257445002
in 1819.

While
Itard
and
Laennec
recognized
that
some cases|398241000|413769002
were
not
due to tuberculosis|371569005
(then
the most common cause|4757001|72906007|134198009
)
,
the concept
of primary spontaneous pneumothorax|63161005|80423007|261424001|80423007
was
reintroduced
by the Danish physician Hans Kj?rgaard|309343006|258788007
in 1932.

In 1941,
the surgeons Tyson|304292004
and
Crandall
introduced|127487003
pleural abrasion|359972009
for the treatment|276239002|416118004
of pneumothorax.[3][31]|36118008|264664006

Prior to the advent
of anti-tuberculous medications,|371569005|410942007
iatrogenic pneumothoraces|441536000
were
intentionally
given|419582001
to people|125676002
with tuberculosis|371569005
in an effort to|19487008
collapse|27942005|16277007|271787007
a lobe,
or
entire lung,|181216001
around a cavitating lesion.|2483006

This
was
known|36692007
as "
resting|258157001
the lung".|39607008|181216001

It
was
introduced|127487003
by the Italian surgeon Carlo Forlanini|297502002|304292004|262364003|31637002|304292004|262364003
in 1888,
and
publicized
by the American surgeon John Benjamin Murphy|304292004|261702002
in the early 20th century|264499004
(
after discovering
the same procedure independently|262126009|71388002
).

Murphy
used|394850002
the
(then
)
recently discovered X-ray technology to|6493001|6493001|52250000|6493001|168537006|6493001|363680008
create
pneumothoraces|36118008
of the correct size.[32]|277049003

Animals|387961004
may
experience
both
spontaneous|5054005
and
traumatic pneumothorax.|90070003

Spontaneous pneumothorax|80423007
is
,
as
in humans,|278412004
classified|73504009
as primary|63161005|261424001
or
secondary,|2603003|81170007
while
traumatic pneumothorax|90070003
is
divided|422033008
into open|56116003
and
closed|29179001
(
with
or
without chest wall damage|78904004|37782003|181608004|37782003
).

The diagnosis|439401001
may
be
apparent
to the veterinary physician|53216000|309343006
because
the animal|387961004
exhibits
difficulty breathing|267036007
in,
or
has
shallow breathing.|386616007

Pneumothoraces|36118008
may
arise|68727004
from lung lesions|301232003
(
such as bullae|408764000
)
or
from trauma
to the chest wall.|78904004|181608004

In horses,|35354009
traumatic pneumothorax|90070003
may
involve|248448006
both
hemithoraces,|422614002
as
the mediastinum|264099006|94931004|181217005
is
incomplete|255599008|255609007
and
there
is
a direct connection|255589003|263538003
between the two halves|420797005
of the chest.|261179002

Tension pneumothorax?|233645004
the presence|386397008
of which
may
be
suspected|415684004
due to rapidly|418694008
deteriorating
heart function,|86185002
absent lung|2667000|39607008|2667000|181216001
sounds
throughout the thorax,|261179002|302551006
and
a barrel-shaped chest?|24228002|107644003|24228002|300842002
is
treated|28995006
with an incision|34896006
in the animal's chest to|387961004|261179002
relieve|397855004
the pressure,|279046003|13543005|257893003
followed|367409002
by insertion|71861002|257867005
of a chest tube.[36]|258643002
