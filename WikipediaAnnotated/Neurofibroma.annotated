*neurofibroma|89084002
*
*
is
a benign nerve sheath tumor|30807003|115242003
in the peripheral nervous system.|3058005

Usually
found|404684003
in individuals|125676002|385435006
with neurofibromatosis type I|92824003
(NF1|92824003|405830009
)
,
an autosomal dominant genetically-inherited disease,|263681008|32895009
they
can
result|394617004
in a range
of symptoms
from physical disfiguration|5880005|19388002
and
pain|22253000
to cognitive disability.|21134002

Neurofibromas|89084002
arise|68727004
from nonmyelinating-type Schwann cells|246238003
that
exhibit
biallelic inactivation
of the NF1 gene|92824003|67271001|405830009|67271001
that codes
for the protein neurofibromin.|88878007|405830009

This protein|88878007
is
responsible|394851003
for
regulating
the RAS-mediated cell growth signaling pathway.|73510009|38952000

In contrast
to schwannomas,|404022001
another type|261664005
of tumor arising|108369006|68727004
from Schwann cells,|44591005
neurofibromas|89084002
incorporate
many additional types|260364009|261664005
of cells|4421005
and
structural elements|57795002
in addition|260364009
to Schwann cells,|44591005
making
it difficult to|52925006
identify|7882003
and
understand|66216009
all the mechanisms|257544000
through which
they
originate
and
develop.[2]

Neurofibromas|89084002
have
been
subdivided
into two broad categories|420797005|90522003
:
dermal|119325001|39937001|181469002
and
plexiform.|264149005

Dermal neurofibromas|254761009
are
associated|47429007
with a single peripheral nerve,|125681006|84782009|125681006|244457007|50607009|84782009|50607009|244457007
while
plexiform neurofibromas|403818001
are
associated|47429007
with multiple nerve bundles.|260396001

According to the World Health Organization classification system,|263775005|21139007|73504009
dermal|119325001|39937001|181469002
and
plexiform neurofibromas|403818001
are
grade|258349007|371469007
I tumors.|42146005|108369006|22971001|108369006

Plexiform neurofibroma|403818001
are
more difficult to|242762006|52925006
treat|395077000
and
can
transform
into malignant tumors.|363346000

Dermal neurofibroma|254761009
do
not
become
malignant.|21594007

Dermal neurofibromas|254761009
(sometimes
referred|439980006
to
as
cutaneous neurofibromas|254761009
)
originate
in nerves|3057000
in the skin.|119325001|39937001|181469002

Three kinds|421291004|261664005
are
distinguished
:
[3]|260313008

Dermal neurofibroma typically|254761009
arise|68727004
in the teenage years|22396007|258707000
and
are
often|70232002
associated|47429007
with the onset|77374008
of puberty.|18991001

They
continue|255238004
to
increase|260366006
in number|410680006|410681005
and
size|277049003
throughout adulthood,|41847000
although
there
are
limits|255469002
to
how big|255509001
they
get.

Dermal neurofibromas|254761009
can
lead|88488004
to stinging,|72587008
itching|424492005
,
pain|22253000
and
disfiguration.

There
is
no evidence|18669006
of malignant transformation.[1]|21594007|61883002

Plexiform neurofibromas|403818001
can
grow
from nerves|3057000
in the skin|119325001|39937001|181469002
or
from more internal nerve bundles,|242762006|260521003
and
can
be
very large.|258262008

Internal plexiform neurofibromas|260521003|403818001
are
very difficult to|260358002|52925006
remove|127485006
completely
because
they
extend|255590007
through multiple layers|260396001
of tissue|85756007
and
the attempt
would
damage|37782003
healthy tissue|263775005|85756007
or
organs.|410653004

Plexiform neurofibromas|403818001
occur|272120004
earlier in life|264499004|224130005
and
are
thought|88952004
to
be
congenital defects.[3]|276654001

Plexiform neurofibroma|403818001
can
cause|23981006|134198009
pain,|22253000
disfigurement,
neurological|1199008
and
other clinical deficits.|74964007|58147004|260372006

Plexiform neurofibromas|403818001
have
the potential to|30207005
cause|23981006|134198009
severe clinical complications|24484000|58147004|116223007
if
they
occur|272120004
in certain areas.[4]|17162000|42798000

About 10%
of plexiform neurofibromas|403818001
undergo
transformation|61883002
into a malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor (MPNST).|404037002

The formation|11798007|255277001
of malignant cancers|21594007|363346000
from neurofibromas|89084002
is
associated|47429007
with the loss
of expression|10012005
of the CDKN2A
or
TP53 gene|67271001
in non-myelinating Schwann cells|23879005|44591005
that also
exhibit
biallelic inactivation
of the NF1 gene.|92824003|67271001|405830009|67271001

This section|62083003|118630004
discusses
the tumorigenesis
of neurofibroma|89084002
in terms
of genetics,
cell signaling,|38952000
histology|67151002
and
the cell cycle.|4421005|44180009|362837007|44180009

The NF1 gene|92824003|67271001|405830009|67271001
is
composed
of 60 exons|33091005
spanning
350kb
of genomic data,|18470003
and
maps|360220002
to chromosomal region 17qll.2.|113354003|410673009

This gene|67271001
codes
for neurofibromin|405830009
which
is
a large 220-250 KDa cytoplasmic protein|255509001|414556008|88878007
that
is
composed
of 2,818 amino acids|260306008|52518006
with three alternatively spliced exons|421291004|85030005|33091005
(9a,
23a
and
48a
).

The functional part|40143009|260726005|246464006|260726005
of neurofibromin|405830009
is
a GAP,
or
GTPase-activating protein.|88878007

GAP
accelerates|14355007
the conversion|272148004
of the active GTP-bound RAS|55561003|91262008|75958009|55561003|91262008|257768005|55561003|91262008|418131003
to its inactive GDP-bound form,|73425007|57858007|75958009|246176004|73425007|57858007|257768005|246176004|73425007|57858007|418131003|246176004
inactivating
RAS
and
reducing RAS-mediated growth signaling.|260400001|73510009|38952000

Loss
of RAS control|31509003
leads|88488004|236874000
to increased activity|28277004
of other signaling pathways|74964007|38952000
including|55919000
RAF,
ERK1/2,
PI3K,
PAK|223603007
and
mTOR-S6 kinase.|304257007

It
is
suspected|415684004
that
this increased activity|28277004
of downstream RAS pathways|103365002
might
work|261041009
together to
increase|260366006
cell growth|4421005|362837007
and
survival.

Genes|67271001
that
code
for proteins|88878007
that
regulate
cell growth,|4421005|362837007
such as NF1|92824003|405830009
and
TP53,
are
referred|439980006
to
as
tumor suppressor genes.|77864004

Neurofibromin|405830009
has
other growth-regulatory properties|74964007|370130000|74964007|116685008
besides its ability to|371150009
regulate
RAS activity,|48761009|55561003|258745004|257733005
but
these other functions|74964007|246464006
are
poorly|556001
understood|66216009
at this time.[8]|410669006

There
are
two kinds|420797005|261664005
of Schwann cells,|44591005
myelinating|23879005
and
nonmyelinating.

While
myelinating|23879005
Schwann cells|44591005
cover|255334000
large diameter|255509001|81827009
(
>1 micrometer|260305007|258674000
)
peripheral nervous system (PNS) axons|3058005|60436000
with myelin,|79612000|23879005
nonmyelinating
Schwann cells|44591005
encapsulate|59135002
small diameter PNS axons|255507004|81827009|3058005|60436000
with their cytoplasmic processes.|415178003

Nonmyelinating Schwann cells|44591005
are
the neoplastic element|108369006|57795002
in neurofibromas.|89084002

This conglomeration
of nonmyelinating Schwann cells|44591005
and
axons|60436000
is
called
a Remak bundle.

While
nonmyelinating
Schwann cells|44591005
are
the origin|255395001
of neurofibromas,|89084002
the mutations|55446002
that
make
them susceptible|131196009
to this transformation|61883002
occur|272120004
in Schwann cell precursors|418318001
during early nerve development.|264499004|3057000|278923009|264499004|256864008|278923009

Mutated|55446002
nonmyelinating Schwann cells|44591005
do
not
form|246176004
normal Remak bundles.|17621005|258744000

Instead,
they
fail
to properly
surround|355648006
and
segregate
target axons.|60436000

It
is
unknown|261665006
at this time|410669006
why,
if
both
types|261664005
of Schwann cells|44591005
exhibit
bilallelic inactivation
of the NF1 gene,|92824003|67271001|405830009|67271001
only
the nonmyelinating variety
give|419582001
rise
to neurofibromas.[9]|89084002

Neurofibromas|89084002
arise|68727004
from nonmyelinating Schwann cells|44591005
that
are
homozygous|22061001
for the inactive version|73425007|22303008
of the NF1 gene,|92824003|67271001|405830009|67271001
which
leads|88488004|236874000
to a complete loss|255594003
of expression|10012005
of neurofibromin_[disambiguation|405830009
needed|410525008|103325001
_].

While
one defective allele|421379005|9109004
may
be
inherited|255404009
,
loss of heterozygosity (LOH)|14556007
must
occur|272120004
before a neurofibroma|89084002
can
form|246176004
;
this
is
called
the ?two-hit hypothesis?.|420797005|30166007

This LOH happens
by the same mechanisms,|262126009|257544000
such as oxidative DNA damage,|68349007
that
causes|134198009
mutations|55446002
in other cells.|74964007|4421005

Once a nonmyelinating Schwann cell|44591005
has
suffered inactivation
of its NF1 genes,|92824003|67271001|405830009|67271001
it
begins|255395001
to
proliferate
rapidly.|418694008

This condition|260905004
is
called hyperplasia,|76197007
which
is
cell growth|4421005|362837007
beyond what
is
normally
seen.

However,
despite
increased numbers|35105006|410680006|35105006|410681005|260366006|410680006|260366006|410681005
of nonmyelinating Schwann cells,|44591005
there
is
no neurofibroma yet.|89084002

In order
for the neurofibroma to|89084002
develop
,
cells|4421005
that
are
heterozygous|14556007
for the NF1 gene|92824003|67271001|405830009|67271001
must
be
recruited
to the site.|10546003

It
has
been
hypothesized
that
the proliferating nonmyelinating Schwann cells|44591005
secrete
chemoattractants
such as the KIT ligand,
and
angiogenic factors
such as the heparin-binding growth factor midkine.|96382006|257768005|81286007

These chemicals|441900009
promote
the migration|74118003
of different kinds|263735002|261664005
of cells|4421005
that
are
heterozygous|14556007
for the NF1 gene|92824003|67271001|405830009|67271001
into the hyperplastic lesions|76197007
created
by the nonmyelinating Schwann cells.|44591005

These cell types|4421005|246238003
include|55919000
fibroblasts,|52547004
perineurial cells,|68661006|4421005
endothelial cells,|45709008
and
mast cells.|6445007

The mast cells then|6445007
secrete
mitogens|81286007
or
survival factors
that
alter
the developing tumor microenvironment|108369006
and
result|394617004
in neurofibroma formation.|89084002|11798007|89084002|255277001

Dermal|119325001|39937001|181469002
and
plexiform neurofibromas|403818001
differ
in later development stages,|260383002|278923009|261612004
but
the details
are
unclear
at this point.[7]

A blood test|252275004

may
be
used|394850002
to
detect|260373001
the presence|386397008
of neurofibromas.[10][11]|89084002

Dermal neurofibromas|254761009
are
not usually surgically|83578000
removed|127485006
unless
they
are
painful|22253000
or
disfiguring,
because
there
are
generally so many
of them
and
they
are
not dangerous.

CO2 lasers|118312003
have
been
used|394850002
to
remove|127485006
dermal neurofibromas.|254761009

In a paper|50833004
titled

said|66049007
this about treatment|276239002|416118004
by laser|122456005|38586004
: ?
The cosmetic disfigurement|81024003|261513001
is
the most important issue|4757001|55607006
in the decision to
treat|395077000
cutaneous symptoms|308926009
of neurofibromatosis.|19133005

Treating patients|28995006|116154003
with extensive neurofibromas|41118005|89084002
with [
a] CO2 laser|118312003
is
still
the best choice.

However,
it
is
strongly
advised|424900004
that
a test treatment|269814003|276239002|269814003|416118004|276239002|416118004|272393004|276239002|272393004|416118004
be
performed|398166005
to
judge|11205001
the effectiveness|255403003
of the procedure|71388002
and
whether
the developed scar|70582006|275322007
is
an acceptable trade-off.?
[12]

As of 2002,
the primary treatment option|63161005|276239002|63161005|416118004|261424001|276239002|261424001|416118004
for plexiform neurofibroma|403818001
was
surgery.[13]|83578000

Removal|118292001|128303001
of plexiform neurofibromas|403818001
is
difficult|52925006
because
they
can
be
large|255509001
and
cross tissue boundaries.|85756007

However,
besides pain,|22253000
plexiform neurofibromas|403818001
are
sometimes
removed|127485006
due to the possibility
of malignant transformation.|21594007|61883002

The following examples|255260001
show
that plexiform neurofibromas|403818001
can
form|246176004
anywhere
and
can
make
surgical resection|118292001|128303001
difficult|52925006
:

Once a plexiform neurofibroma|403818001
has
undergone malignant transformation,|21594007|61883002
radiation|30821001|82107009|108290001
and
chemotherapy|416608005|367336001
can
be
used|394850002
as treatment.|276239002|416118004

However,
radiation|30821001|82107009|108290001
is
generally
not
used|394850002
as a treatment|276239002|416118004
for plexiform neurofibromas|403818001
because of
concerns
that
this
could
actually
promote
malignant transformation.|21594007|61883002

There
has
even
been
a documented case|397934002|398241000
of a Schwannoma|404022001
being
induced|16404004
from a neurofibroma|89084002
due to radiation therapy.[17]|108290001

There
are
many drug therapies|260396001|416608005
under study|110465008|224699009
for neurofibromas.|89084002

These
are
in various stages|256220008|261612004
of research
;
more time|242762006|410669006
will
be
required
to
determine
if
these
are
viable options|263927007
for the treatment|276239002|416118004
of neurofibromas.|89084002

ACE inhibitors|372733002
have
been
proposed
as a novel treatment|7147002|276239002|7147002|416118004
of neurofibromas.|89084002

ACE inhibitors|372733002
are
currently|15240007
used|394850002
to
treat|395077000
hypertension|38341003
and
congestive heart failure,|42343007
to
avert
remodeling
and
reinfarction
after myocardial infarction,|22298006
and
to
ameliorate
diabetic nephropathy|127013003
and
other renal diseases.|74964007|90708001

ACE inhibitors|372733002
work|261041009
by indirectly
down regulating|247524003
TGF-beta,|52095000|260989008
which
is
a growth factor|81286007
that
has
been
shown
to
influence
the development|278923009
of tumors.[20]|108369006

Based|418836005
on the recent discovery|6493001
that
the nonmyelinating Schwann cells|44591005
that make up Remak bundles|255532002|353734004
are
the origin|255395001
of neurofibromas,|89084002
it
has
been
proposed
that therapies|276239002
for prevention|169443000
and
treatment|276239002|416118004
be
based|418836005
on stabilizing|409051000
the axon-Schwann cell interactions|60436000|44591005
and
reducing mast cell infiltration.|260400001|6445007|47351003|260400001|6445007|231287002

As
it
appears
that
these elements|57795002
are
needed|410525008|103325001
for neurofibroma formation,|89084002|11798007|89084002|255277001
prevention|169443000
or
reduction|58294000|260400001|289928003
could
prove|277025001
an effective treatment.[9]|255403003|276239002|255403003|416118004|254648000|276239002|254648000|416118004

Gene therapy|394613000
for the neurofibromin 1 gene|405830009|67271001
represents
the ultimate solution|8537005|77899000
to preventing|116699007
the cluster
of maladies
which
are
enabled|225791005
by the mutation.[21][22]|55446002

As of 2006,
therapy|276239002
for NF1 tumors|92824003|108369006|405830009|108369006
had
not
been
tested|272393004
due to the lack|41277001
of an appropriate NF1 tumor model.[23]|92824003|108369006|264657009|405830009|108369006|264657009
