)
is
a medical condition|74188005|260905004
in which
the eye|81745001|244486005
fails
to
produce
tears.|40431001|122594008

It
may
be
caused|23981006|134198009
by a deficiency|260372006|248325000
in vitamin A|82622003
and
is
sometimes
used|394850002
to
describe
that lack,|41277001
although
there
may
be
other causes.|74964007|134198009

Xerophthalmia|363677007
caused|23981006|134198009
by a severe vitamin A deficiency|24484000|72000004
is
described
by pathologic dryness|29458008|13880007
of the conjunctiva|29445007|181161008
and
cornea.|28726007|181162001

The conjunctiva|29445007|181161008
becomes
dry, thick|13880007|246703001
and
wrinkled.|247434009|27367001

If
untreated|25265005
,
it
can
lead|88488004
to corneal ulceration|91514001
and
ultimately
to blindness
as a result|394617004
of corneal damage.|28726007|37782003

Xerophthalmia|363677007
is
a term
that usually
implies
a destructive dryness|255303004|13880007
of the conjunctival epithelium|29445007|31610004
due to dietary vitamin A deficiency ?|41829006|72000004
a rare condition|84638005|260905004|103356009|260905004
in developed countries,|223369002
but
still
causing|23981006
much damage|37782003
in developing countries.|223369002

Other forms|74964007|246176004
of dry eye|46152009|1249004
are
associated|47429007
with aging,|248280005
poor lid closure,|11403006|112695004|255351007|112695004
scarring|275322007
from previous injury,|9130008
or
autoimmune diseases|85828009
such as rheumatoid arthritis|69896004
and
Sj?gren's syndrome,
and
these
can
all
cause|23981006|134198009
chronic conjunctivitis.|73762008

Radioiodine therapy|276239002
can
also
induce|16404004
xerophthalmia,|363677007
often transiently,|70232002
although
in some patients|116154003
late onset|260383002|77374008
or
persistent xerophthalmia|363677007
has
been
observed.[1]

The damage|37782003
to the cornea|28726007|181162001
in vitamin A associated xerophthalmia|82622003|47429007|363677007|47429007|363677007
is
quite different|263735002
from damage|37782003
to the retina|5665001|181171005
at the back of the globe,|255551008|81745001|255551008|244486005
a type|261664005
of damage|37782003
which
can
also
be
due to lack|41277001
of vitamin A,|82622003
but
which
is
caused|23981006|134198009
by lack|41277001
of other forms|74964007|246176004
of vitamin A|82622003
which
work|261041009
in the visual system.|49549006|281831001

Xerophthalmia|363677007
from _hypovitaminosis A_|85670002
is
specifically
due to lack|41277001
of the hormone-like vitamin A metabolite retinoic acid,|87568004|387305002
since
(
along
with certain growth-stunting effects|17162000|253861007
)
the condition|260905004
can
be
reversed
in vitamin A deficient rats|82622003|260372006|371565004|82622003|260372006|371564000|82622003|418446003|371565004|82622003|418446003|371564000|260372006|371565004|260372006|371564000|418446003|371565004|418446003|371564000
by retinoic acid supplementation|387305002
(however
the retinal damage|41445001
continues|255238004
).

Since
retinoic acid|387305002
cannot
be
reduced|260400001
to retinal|5665001|103067001
or
retinol,|82622003|76609004
these effects|253861007
on the cornea|28726007|181162001
must
be
specific|69658003
to retinoic acid.|387305002

This
is
in keeping
with retinoic acid's known requirement|387305002|36692007
for good health|405153007
in epithelial cells,|4212006|395202001
such as those in the cornea.|52101004|28726007|52101004|181162001|18720000|28726007|18720000|181162001

Xerophthalmia usually|363677007
affects|4065008
children|410601007|160499008
under nine years|422113007|258707000
old|70753007
and
"accounts
for 20,000-100,000 new cases|7147002|398241000|7147002|413769002
of childhood blindness|68433009
each year|258707000|259039008
in the developing countries."|223369002
The disease|64572001
is
largely
found|404684003
in developing countries|223369002
like many|260396001
of those in Africa|52101004|223498002|18720000|223498002
and
Southern Asia.|223500001

The condition|260905004
is
not congenital|6160004|255399007
and
develops
over the course|288524001
of a few months|57176003|258706009
as the lacrimal glands|13561001
fail
to
produce
tears.|40431001|122594008

Other conditions|74964007|260905004
involved|248448006
in the progression already|246453008|246450006
stated|398070004
include|55919000
the appearance|386548000|255412001
of Bitot's spots,|246871006
which
are
clumps|19202001
of keratin debris|29463007
that build up|255532002|353734004
inside the conjunctiva|29445007|181161008
and
night blindness,|65194006
which
precedes|236874000
corneal ulceration|91514001
and
total blindness.|258755000|255619001

Treatment|276239002|416118004
can
occur|272120004
in two ways|420797005
:
treating symptoms|28995006
and
treating|28995006
the deficiency.|260372006|248325000

Treatment|276239002|416118004
of symptoms usually
includes|55919000
use|277889008|419385000
of artificial tears|71967004|40431001|71967004|122594008
in the form|246176004
of eye drops,|385125006
increasing|260369004
the humidity|3525006
of the environment|276339004
with humidifiers,|71545009
and
wearing wrap around glasses|262318008|50121007
when
outdoors.

Treatment|276239002|416118004
of the deficiency|260372006|248325000
can
be
accomplished
with a Vitamin A|82622003
or
multivitamin supplement|10632007|373453009
or
by eating foods|48263008|255620007
rich|224166006
in Vitamin A.|82622003

Treatment|276239002|416118004
with supplements|373453009
and/or
diet|41829006
can
be
successful|385669000
until the disease progresses|64572001|385651009
as far as corneal ulceration,|91514001
at which
point
only
an extreme surgery|12565001|83578000
can
offer|410527000
a chance
of
returning|7528007
sight.|281004000

Prophylaxis|169443000
consists
of periodic administration|81591007|413454004|81591007|416118004
of Vitamin A supplements.|82622003|373453009|373453009
