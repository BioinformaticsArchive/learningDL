*,
colloquially
known|36692007
as "sun sneezing"_[citation|49926000|162367006
needed|410525008|103325001

)
is
a condition|260905004
of uncontrollable sneezing|162367006
in response
to numerous stimuli,|260396001|8927009
such as looking|386548000
at bright lights|221668007|56242006
or
periocular
(
surrounding|355648006
the eyeball|81745001
)
injection.|28289002|385218009|129326001

The condition|260905004
affects|4065008
18?35%
of the population,|385436007|389109008
but
its exact mechanism|257544000
of action|129264002
is
not well understood.[1]|20572008|66216009

Photic sneeze reflex,|45832002|162367006
also sometimes
referred|439980006
to
using|260676000
the backronym Autosomal dominant Compelling Helio-Ophthalmic Outburst (ACHOO) syndrome,|263681008
[2]|260306008
and
the "Peroutka Sneeze Gene",|162367006|67271001
is
a hereditary trait|85995004
which
causes|134198009
sneezing, possibly many times consecutively|162367006|60022001|410669006|162367006|60022001|417929005
(
due to naso-ocular reflex [3]|260540009|81745001|87572000|260540009|81745001|106146005|260540009|281004000|87572000|260540009|281004000|106146005|260540009|87572000|260540009|106146005
)
when
suddenly
exposed|24932003
to bright light.|221668007|56242006|221668007|371268001

The condition|260905004
affects|4065008
18-35%
of the human population.[4]|278412004|385436007|278412004|389109008

The first mention|255216001|232714002
of the phenomenon
is
probably
in the later work|260383002|261041009
attributed|246061005
to Aristotle
(Problems,|55607006
book XXXIII|278212002
).

(
between the third century BCE|70905002
to the 6th century CE
).

There
does
not
appear
to
be
evidence|18669006
that
this sneeze reflex|162367006|87572000|162367006|106146005
is
actually
inherited|255404009
in an autosomal dominant fashion.|263681008

Some SNPs
have
been
associated|47429007
with photic sneeze reflex,|45832002|162367006
yet much
of the heredity
remains
to
be
understood.[6]|66216009

While
this phenomenon
is
poorly|556001
understood,|66216009
recent research|6493001
has
shown
that antihistamines|372806008
being
used to|394850002
treat|395077000
rhinitis|70076002
due to seasonal allergies|444316004
may
also
reduce|260400001
the occurrence|272120004
of solar sneezes|49926000|162367006
in people|125676002
affected|247591002|248448006
by
both
conditions.[7]|260905004

Some people|125676002
may
find
relief|224978009
by shielding|30115002
their eyes|81745001
and/or
faces|89545001
with hats,|261368003
scarves,|226055004
and
sunglasses._[citation|420299007

The photic sneeze reflex|45832002|162367006
manifests|250255003
itself
in the form|246176004
of uncontrollable sneezing|162367006
in response
to a stimulus|8927009
which
would
not
produce
a sneeze|162367006
in people|125676002
without the disorder.|64572001

The sneezes generally|162367006
occur|272120004
in bursts|255331008
of 1
to 10 sneezes,|162367006
followed|367409002
by a refractory period|20646008|259037005
that
can
be
as long|255511005
as 24 hours.|123027009|259029002

A photic sneeze|56242006|162367006|371268001|162367006
is
the most common manifestation|4757001|72906007|250255003|4757001|72906007|251190009
of the photic sneeze reflex.|45832002|162367006

A photic sneeze|56242006|162367006|371268001|162367006
is
a sneeze|162367006
that results|394617004
from exposure|71677004|24932003
to a bright light.|221668007|56242006|221668007|371268001

The photic sneeze reflex|45832002|162367006
seems
to
be
caused|23981006|134198009
by a change|243326001|263703002
in light intensity|56242006|103370009|371268001|103370009
rather than
due to a specific wavelength|69658003|246522008
of light.|56242006|371268001

Photic sneezes|56242006|162367006|371268001|162367006
are
harmless
annoyances
for the most part,|4757001|260726005
but
can
pose
physical risk|5880005|30207005|19388002|30207005
to people|125676002
who
are
operating vehicles|412307009
or
machinery,|20273004
which
involves|248448006
precise movement|255324009
and
reactions.|263851003

A study|110465008|224699009
conducted|844005
by the School|257698009
of Optometry
at the University of Alabama|224871002|224038000
at Birmingham,
found|404684003
that females|248152002
represent
67%
of photic sneezers.|56242006|371268001

94%
of those
were
Caucasian.|413773004|185984009

The study also|110465008|224699009
found|404684003
statistically significant correlations|386134007
between photic sneezing|56242006|162367006|371268001|162367006
and
the presence|386397008
of a deviated septum.|126660000

The study also|110465008|224699009
showed
that photic sneezing|56242006|162367006|371268001|162367006
is
more likely to|242762006|2931005
be
acquired|255396000
than
inherited.[8]|255404009

During surgeries|83578000
in
and
around the eye,|81745001|244486005
such as corneal transplant surgery,|72208004|263903005|72208004|24486003|421582004|263903005|421582004|24486003|293820001|83578000
the patient often|116154003|70232002
requires
injection|28289002|385218009|129326001
of a local anesthetic|386761002|373477003
into the eye.|81745001|244486005

In patients|116154003
who
show
the photic sneeze reflex,|45832002|162367006
an injection|28289002|385218009|129326001
into the eye,|81745001|244486005
such as that
undergone
in a retrobulbar|33428000|418321004
or
peribulbar block|305115003
can
often|70232002
elicit|263516000
a sneeze|162367006
from the patient.|116154003

During these procedures,|71388002
the patient|116154003
may
be
sedated|17971005
prior to the periocular injection.|416845001

The patient|116154003
begins|255395001
to
sneeze|162367006
just
as the needle|79068005
is
inserted|257867005
into the eye,|81745001|244486005
often|70232002
resulting|42752001
in the anesthesiologist|88189002
having
to
remove|127485006
the needle|79068005
before injecting|422145002
the local anesthetic|386761002|373477003
in order to
avoid
damaging|37782003
the patient's eye.[9]|116154003|81745001|116154003|244486005

Stomach fullness|69695003|255342004|181246003|255342004
is
another example
of a stimulus|8927009
that
causes|134198009
uncontrollable sneezing|162367006
that
may
be
linked
to the photic sneeze reflex.|45832002|162367006

People|125676002
who
exhibit
this symptom
undergo
uncontrollable fits|91175000
of 3-15 sneezes immediately|260313008|162367006|49499008
after
eating|48263008
large meals|255509001
which completely
fill
the stomach.|69695003|181246003

The so-called snatiation reflex|223528007|87572000|223528007|106146005
occurs|272120004
independently of the choice
of food eaten,|255620007|48263008
and
is
not
believed
to
be
an allergic reaction|421961002
of any kind.|261664005

Although
even less well-understood|20572008|66216009
than photic sneezing|56242006|162367006|371268001|162367006
and
sneezing|162367006
in response
to periocular injection,|416845001
the trait
appears
to
be
inherited|255404009
in an autosomal dominant fashion.[11]|263681008

There
is
much
debate
about the true cause|31874001|134198009
and
mechanism|257544000
of the sneezing fits|162367006|162367006|91175000
brought|68369002
about
by the photic sneeze reflex.|45832002|162367006

Sneezing|162367006
occurs|272120004
in response
to irritation|257553007
in the nasal cavity,|279549004|263481003
which
results|394617004
in an afferent signal propagating|49530007
through the ophthalmic
and
maxillary branches|70925003|127484005
of the trigeminal nerve|27612005
to the trigeminal nerve nuclei|280164007|3057000|280164007|256864008
in the brainstem.|15926001|180925009

The signal
is
interpreted|363714003
in the trigeminal nerve nuclei,|280164007|3057000|280164007|256864008
and
an efferent signal goes|33843005
to different parts|263735002|260726005
of the body,|279495008|123037004
such as mucous glands|61001002
and
the diaphragm,|263734003|336704008|181614006
thus
producing
a sneeze.|162367006

The most obvious difference|4757001|263735002
between a normal sneeze|17621005|162367006|258744000|162367006
and
one|421379005
caused|23981006|134198009
by the photic sneeze reflex|45832002|162367006
is
the stimulus - normal sneezes|8927009|17621005|162367006|8927009|258744000|162367006
occur|272120004
due to irritation|257553007
in the nasal cavity,|279549004|263481003
while
the latter
can
result|394617004
from a wide variety|90522003
of stimuli.|8927009

Some
of the theories
regarding
the mechanism|257544000
of a sneeze|162367006
resulting|42752001
from an unusual stimulus|8927009
are
below.

Stimulation|122545008
of the ophthalmic branch|127484005
of the trigeminal nerve|27612005
may
enhance
the irritability|55929007
of the maxillary branch,|70925003|127484005
resulting|42752001
in an increased probability|35105006|2931005|260366006|2931005
of sneezing.|162367006

This
is
similar
to the mechanism|257544000
by which photophobia|409668002
develops
by persistent light exposure relaying signals|56242006|71677004|56242006|24932003|371268001|71677004|371268001|24932003
through the optic nerve|18234004|180938001
and
trigeminal nerve to|27612005
produce
increased sensitivity|35105006|35209006|35105006|365705006|260366006|35209006|260366006|365705006
in the ophthalmic branch.|127484005

If
this increased sensitivity|35105006|35209006|35105006|365705006|260366006|35209006|260366006|365705006
occurred|272120004
in the maxillary branch|70925003|127484005
instead of the ophthalmic branch,|127484005
a sneeze|162367006
could
result|394617004
instead of photophobia.[12]|409668002

The parasympathetic nervous system|23424009
has
many neighboring fibers|40415009|400293002|40415009|37202001
that
respond
to different stimuli.|263735002|8927009

When
one stimulus|421379005|8927009
activates
multiple nerve fibers|260396001|88545005
of the parasympathetic nervous system,|23424009
parasympathetic generalization
is
occurring.|272120004

There
is
a possibility
that sensory input|262139008
from the eyes|81745001
could
travel|420008001
to the neurons|47220008
in the cortex|40146001
that
interpret|363714003
such signals,
but
neighboring neurons|40415009|47220008
which
are
involved|248448006
in sneezing|162367006
are
also
activated
,
due to the generalization.

This
could
lead|88488004
to a sneeze|162367006
in response
to a stimulus|8927009
other than nasal irritation.[12]

When
the trigeminal nerve|27612005
is
directly
stimulated
,
there
is
the possibility
that increased light sensitivity|35105006|409668002|260366006|409668002
in the ocular nerve|81745001|3057000|81745001|256864008|281004000|3057000|281004000|256864008|3057000|256864008
could
result.|394617004

An example
of directly stimulating
would
be
plucking
an eyebrow|392262008|265781000
or
pulling hair.|17155009

In many people|125676002
who
show
the photic sneeze reflex,|45832002|162367006
even
this direct stimulation|255589003|122545008
can
lead|88488004
to a photic sneeze.[12]|56242006|162367006|371268001|162367006

Uncontrollable sneezing|162367006
during a periocular injection|416845001
while
sedated|17971005
by propofol|387423006
is
likely|2931005
caused|23981006|134198009
by the propofol.|387423006

Propofol|387423006
has
been
shown
to temporarily
suppress|245780008
inhibitory neurons|61511001|47220008
in the brainstem,|15926001|180925009
which
is
also
where the trigeminal nucleus -|280164007
the "sneeze center"|162367006|26216008
of the brain -|12738006|258335003
lies.|40199007|255576009

This chain|46666003
of events|272379006
leads|88488004|236874000
to increased sensitivity|35105006|35209006|35105006|365705006|260366006|35209006|260366006|365705006
to stimulation|122545008
and
reduced threshold|260400001|118589004
for involuntary responses.

In this hypersensitive state,|398070004
the periocular injection|416845001
stimulates
the ophthalmic
and/or
maxillary branch|70925003|127484005
of the trigeminal nerve,|27612005
which
results|394617004
in summation|85098000
in the trigeminal nuclei.|280164007

This summation|85098000
can
lead|88488004
to a sneeze|162367006
in the unconscious patient.[13]|418107008|116154003

Sneezing generally|162367006
does
not
present|52101004|246105001
any particular risks|30207005
to the individual,|125676002|385435006
and
is
usually more
of an annoyance
than a risk|30207005
of injury.

The fits|91175000
of sneezing|162367006
brought about|68369002
by the photic sneeze reflex|45832002|162367006
can
,
however,
have
dangerous implications
during certain scenarios|17162000
and
activities|257733005
such as driving|129060000
or
operating machinery.|20273004

Perhaps
the most universal risk|4757001|73548004|30207005
of sneezing|162367006
is
the
spread|410677005
of disease.|64572001

Bacterial infections|301811001
can
spread|410677005
to susceptible uninfected people|131196009|125676002
via the
spread|410677005
of microscopic organisms|84496004|410653004
suspended|385655000
in the droplets
expelled
by a sneeze.|162367006

Bacteria|409822003
which commonly
spread|410677005
by sneezing|162367006
include|55919000
bacterial meningitis,|95883001
strep throat,|43878008
and
tuberculosis.|371569005

Viral infections|34014006
can
also
be
spread|410677005
by sneezing.|162367006

When
a virus|49872002
is
expelled
by a sneeze,|162367006
its mucous membrane evaporates,|313268005
and
the virus|49872002
becomes
a droplet nucleus|84640000
which
can
be
inhaled|14910006
by another person,|125676002
thus
spreading|410677005
the virulent infection.

Examples
of virulent infections
that
spread|410677005
by sneezing|162367006
include|55919000
measles,|14189004
mumps,|240526004
rubella,|36653000
and
influenza.[14]|6142004|396425006

A fit|91175000|102499006
of sneezing|162367006
while
operating
a vehicle|412307009|261324000
can
cause|23981006|134198009
the operator to
lose
control|31509003
of
that vehicle,|412307009|261324000
resulting|42752001
in damage|37782003
to the person,|125676002
to the vehicle|412307009|261324000
and/or
to the surroundings.|355648006

In particular, photic sneezing|56242006|162367006|371268001|162367006
poses
a considerable risk|30207005
to pilots,|308040008
due to the frequent presence|70232002|386397008
of bright sunlight|221668007|49926000
and
the precise reactions|263851003
needed|410525008|103325001
to successfully
control|31509003
the aircraft.|21753002

For the pilot|308040008
of a fighter aircraft,|21753002
if
an uncontrollable fit|91175000|102499006
of sneezing|162367006
were
to
occur|272120004
during aerial combat,
the pilot|308040008
could
be
incapacitated
when
his
or
her situational awareness|312012004
needs|410525008|103325001
to
be
greatest.|4757001

A plane landing|260225008|224718008
on an aircraft carrier|21753002|47461006|21753002|29679002
or
shoreline also
requires
incredibly precise movements|255324009
and
quick reflexes.|255358001|87572000|255358001|106146005

The reflection
of the sun|49926000
from surrounding water|355648006|11713004|355648006|119318008
has
a high probability|75540009|2931005|371879000|2931005
of producing
at least one photic sneeze|276139006|421379005|56242006|162367006|276139006|421379005|371268001|162367006|263796003|421379005|56242006|162367006|263796003|421379005|371268001|162367006
for pilots|308040008
who
have
the reflex.|87572000|106146005

Any amount|107651007
of sneezing|162367006
while
attempting
to land|224718008
could
cause|23981006|134198009
the pilot to|308040008
lose
control,|31509003
potentially
resulting|42752001
in disaster.[1]

Uncontrollable fits|91175000
of sneezing|162367006
are
common|72906007
in patients|116154003
under propofol sedation|387423006|72641008|387423006
who
undergo
periocular
or
retrobulbar injection.|33428000|28289002|33428000|385218009|33428000|129326001|418321004|28289002|418321004|385218009|418321004|129326001

A sneeze|162367006
by a sedated patient often|17971005|116154003|70232002
occurs|272120004
upon insertion|71861002|257867005
of a needle|79068005
into
or
around their eye.|81745001|244486005

The violent
and
uncontrollable movement|255324009
of the head|69536005|302548004
during a reflexive sneeze|162367006
has
potential to|30207005
cause|23981006|134198009
damage|37782003
within the patient's eye|116154003|81745001|116154003|244486005
if
the needle|79068005
is
not
removed|127485006
before the sneeze|162367006
occurs.[13]|272120004

There
is
currently|15240007
no definitive way to|261002007
cure
the sneezing fits|162367006|162367006|91175000
brought|68369002
on
by the photic sneeze reflex.|45832002|162367006

Photic sneezing|56242006|162367006|371268001|162367006
can
be
combated
by shielding one's eyes|30115002|421379005|81745001
with hats|261368003
or
sunglasses.|420299007

There
are
many remedial fixes|260396001|102491009
for sneezing,|162367006
such as placing|257557008
a finger horizontally|7569003|302541005
below the nose|260540009|181195007
or
holding
the nose|260540009|181195007
closed|29179001
when
the beginnings|255395001
of a sneeze|162367006
are
felt.|285854004

The most helpful way to|4757001
avoid
the risks|30207005
stated|398070004
above|261183002
is
to
be
aware|312012004
of any inclination to
sneeze|162367006
in response
to strange stimuli.|8927009

If
a pilot|308040008
knows|36692007
he
is
at risk|410519009
for experiencing
a photic sneeze|56242006|162367006|371268001|162367006
during a flight,
he
can
wear
polarized goggles to|272183000
block|26036001|112232007
out
the sun,|49926000
or
at the very least|260358002
be
prepared
for a sneeze|162367006
and
have
measures|246445000|367346004
planned|397943006
to
minimize
the risk|30207005
from such
a sneeze.|162367006

Any patient|116154003
with a history|392521001
of uncontrollable sneezing|162367006
who
requires
periocular surgery|83578000
should
tell
his doctor|309343006
or
anesthesiologist,|88189002
so
that
they
can
take|419652001
appropriate measures to|246445000|367346004
minimize
the risk|30207005
of injury
in case|398241000
of a sneeze|162367006
during the surgical procedure.|83578000

People|125676002
who
know|36692007
they
have
a tendency to
experience
sneezing fits|162367006|162367006|91175000
after consuming
a large meal|255509001
can
make
an effort to|19487008
reduce|260400001
the size|277049003
of their meals,
since
snatiation
seems
to
occur|272120004
only
as a result|394617004
of an extremely full stomach.|261015003|69695003|261015003|181246003
