*Erectile dysfunction** (* * ED * *)|397803000
is
sexual dysfunction|56627002|231532002
characterized
by the inability to
develop
or
maintain|385630006
an erection|60704006
of the penis|18911002|265793009
during sexual performance.[1]|365952006

A penile erection|60704006
is
the hydraulic effect|253861007
of blood entering|87612001|417985001|119273009|417985001
and
being
retained|397909002
in sponge-like bodies|106902003|279495008|106902003|123037004|257264006|279495008|257264006|123037004
within the penis.|18911002|265793009

The process|415178003
is
often|70232002
initiated
as a result|394617004
of sexual arousal,|33105009|248762000
when
signals
are
transmitted|60117003|258150004
from the brain|12738006|258335003
to nerves|3057000
in the penis.|18911002|265793009

Erectile dysfunction|397803000
is
indicated|410535002
when
an erection|60704006
is
difficult to|52925006
produce.

There
are
various circulatory causes,|256220008|413854007|134198009
including|55919000
alteration
of the voltage-gated potassium channel,|88480006|255592004
as
in arsenic poisoning|418685002
from drinking water.|160573003|11713004|160573003|119318008|30953006|11713004|30953006|119318008

The most important organic causes|4757001|134198009
are
cardiovascular disease|49601007
and
diabetes,|73211009
neurological problems|299960009
(
for example,
trauma
from prostatectomy surgery|90470006|83578000
)
,
hormonal insufficiencies|278994005|87828008
(hypogonadism|48130008
and
drug side effects.|264519003

Psychological impotence|60224009|397803000
is
where erection|60704006
or
penetration|53568006
fails
due to thoughts|88952004
or
feelings|285854004
(psychological reasons|60224009|410666004
)
rather than
physical impossibility|5880005|19388002
;
this
is
somewhat less frequent|70232002
but
often|70232002
can
be
helped.

Notably
in psychological impotence,|60224009|397803000
there
is
a strong response|260404005
to placebo treatment.|276239002|416118004

Erectile dysfunction,|397803000
tied|228197000
closely
as
it
is
about ideas|363878000
of physical well being,|5880005|405153007|19388002|405153007
can
have
severe psychological consequences.|24484000|60224009|103332005

Besides treating|28995006
the underlying causes|134198009
such as potassium deficiency|43339004
or
arsenic contamination|413576005
of drinking water,|160573003|11713004|160573003|119318008|30953006|11713004|30953006|119318008
the first line treatment|255216001|50009006|276239002|255216001|50009006|416118004|232714002|50009006|276239002|232714002|50009006|416118004
of erectile dysfunction|397803000
consists
of a trial|110465008
of PDE5 inhibitor drugs|407313002|410942007
(
the first|255216001|232714002
of which
was
sildenafil|372572000
or
Viagra
).

In some cases,|398241000|413769002
treatment|276239002|416118004
can
involve|248448006
prostaglandin tablets|26351002|385055001|26351002|428673006
in the urethra,|264255005|302513006
injections|28289002|129326001
into the penis,|18911002|265793009
a penile prosthesis,|53996008
a penis pump|18911002|44668000|265793009|44668000
or
vascular reconstructive surgery.[3]|408463005

The Latin term _impotentia coeundi_
describes
simple inability to|13673007
insert|257867005|421532009
the penis|18911002|265793009
into the vagina.|76784001|181441005

It
is
now mostly
replaced|282089006|370124000
by more precise terms._[vague_]|242762006|25615006
The study|110465008|224699009
of erectile dysfunction|397803000
within medicine|410942007
is
covered|255334000
by andrology,
a sub-field|261089000|255798002|118555000|255798002
within urology.|394612005

Erectile dysfunction|397803000
is
characterized
by the regular|17854005
or
repeated inability to|27582007
obtain|398092000
or
maintain|385630006
an erection.|60704006

It
is
analyzed
in several ways|261028005
:

A few causes|57176003|134198009
of impotence|397803000
may
be
iatrogenic|255405005
(medically
caused|23981006|134198009
).

Surgical intervention|83578000
for a number|410680006|410681005
of conditions|260905004
may
remove|127485006
anatomical structures|91723000
necessary
to erection,|60704006
damage nerves,|37782003|3057000
or
impair|260379002|40226000
blood supply.|87612001|425398004|119273009|425398004

Complete removal|255594003|118292001|255594003|128303001
of the prostate gland|263847000
or
external beam radiotherapy|33195004
of the gland|362884007
are
common causes|72906007|134198009
of impotence|397803000
;
both
are
treatments|276239002
for prostate cancer.|399068003|254900004

ED|397803000|225728007
can
also
be
associated|47429007
with bicycling|70224005
due to
both
neurological|1199008
and
vascular problems|27550009
due to compression.|71173004|263720003

The increase risk|260366006|30207005
appears
to
be
about 1.7 fold.[14]|26310004

A recent study|6493001|110465008|6493001|224699009
suggests
an epidemiological association|263534001|272151006
between chronic periodontitis|5689008
(periodontal inflammation|245775004|257552002|8711009|257552002
and
erectile dysfunction,|397803000
[15] similarly
to the association|263534001|272151006
between periodontitis|41565005
and
coronary heart diseases,
[16]
and
cerebrovascular diseases.|62914000

In all
the three conditions|421291004|260905004
(erectile dysfunction,|397803000
coronary heart disease|53741008
and
cerebrovascular diseases|62914000
)
,
despite
the epidemiological association|263534001|272151006
with periodontitis,|41565005
no causative connection|263538003
has
proved|277025001
yet.

February 2011
:
Men|339947000
who
use|277889008|419385000
non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) 3|372665008
times a day|258703001|259032004
for more
than 3 months|260313008|258706009
are
at a 22 percent increased risk|118582008|35105006|30207005|118582008|260366006|30207005
of erectile dysfunction.|397803000

A link
between NSAID use|372665008|277889008|372665008|419385000
and
erectile dysfunction still|397803000
existed
for different age,|263735002|424144002
race,|415229000
ethnicity,|397731000
smoker,|77176002
diabetes,|73211009
hypertension,|38341003
high cholesterol,|75540009|84698008|75540009|412808005|371879000|84698008|371879000|412808005
coronary diasease|80891009
and
other health problems.|74964007|263775005|55607006

But
due to benefit
of NSAID,|372665008
it's too early|264499004
for men to|339947000
avoid
NSAIDs|372665008
based|418836005
solely
on the research
stated|398070004
at Journal
of Urology.[18]|394612005

Penile erection|60704006
is
managed|119270007
by two mechanisms|420797005|257544000
:
the reflex erection,|87572000|60704006|106146005|60704006
which
is
achieved
by directly
touching|52962008
the penile shaft,|75279004
and
the psychogenic erection,|278926001|60704006
which
is
achieved
by erotic|248092002
or
emotional stimuli.|285854004|8927009|408453002|8927009

The former|9130008
uses|277889008|394850002|260676000|419385000
the peripheral nerves|84782009
and
the lower parts|261122009|260726005
of the spinal cord,|2748008|180959008
whereas
the latter
uses|277889008|394850002|260676000|419385000
the limbic system|58590008|361342009
of the brain.|12738006|258335003

In
both
conditions,|260905004
an intact neural system|11163003|3057000|246333005|11163003|256864008|246333005
is
required
for a successful|385669000
and
complete erection.|255594003|60704006

Stimulation|122545008
of the penile shaft|75279004
by the nervous system|25087005|278196006
leads|88488004|236874000
to the secretion|46242002
of nitric oxide (NO),|409378005
which
causes|134198009
the relaxation
of smooth muscles|122447002
of corpora cavernosa|9284003
(
the main erectile tissue|63161005|60704006|85756007
of penis|18911002|265793009
)
,
and
subsequently penile erection.|60704006

Additionally,
adequate levels|51117008|258395000|88323005|258395000
of testosterone|43688007|85470006
(
produced
by the testes|36528006|279572002
and
an intact pituitary gland|11163003|56329008|11163003|181125003
are
required
for the development|278923009
of a healthy erectile system.|263775005|60704006|246333005

As
can
be
understood|66216009
from the mechanisms|257544000
of a normal erection,|17621005|60704006|258744000|60704006
impotence|397803000
may
develop
due to hormonal deficiency,|278994005|260372006|278994005|248325000
disorders|64572001
of the neural system,|3057000|246333005|256864008|246333005
lack|41277001
of adequate penile blood supply|51117008|18911002|87612001|425398004|51117008|18911002|119273009|425398004|88323005|18911002|87612001|425398004|88323005|18911002|119273009|425398004
or
psychological problems.

Restriction|263856008
of blood flow|58190003
can
arise|68727004
from impaired endothelial function|260379002|27168002|246464006|40226000|27168002|246464006
due to the usual causes|134198009
associated|47429007
with coronary artery disease,|53741008|414024009
but
can
also
be
caused|23981006|134198009
by prolonged exposure|255224006|71677004|255224006|24932003
to bright light.|221668007|56242006|221668007|371268001

There
are
no formal tests to|246176004|269814003|246176004|272393004
diagnose|439401001
erectile dysfunction.|397803000

Some blood tests|252275004
are
generally
done
to
exclude|77765009
underlying disease,|64572001
such as hypogonadism|48130008
and
prolactinoma.|134209002

Diabetes|73211009
is
considered
a disorder,|64572001
but
is
also
a risk.|30207005

Impotence|397803000
is
also
related|272151006|262094002
to generally poor physical health,|11403006|5880005|263775005|11403006|19388002|263775005|255351007|5880005|263775005|255351007|19388002|263775005
poor dietary habits,|11403006|41829006|90275003|255351007|41829006|90275003
obesity,|414915002
and
most specifically cardiovascular disease|4757001|49601007
such as coronary artery disease|53741008|414024009
and
peripheral vascular disease.|400047006

A useful
and
simple way to|13673007
distinguish
between physiological|1360005
and
psychological impotence|60224009|397803000
is
to
determine
whether
the patient _ever_|116154003
has
an erection.|60704006

If
_never_,
the problem|55607006
is
likely to|2931005
be
physiological|1360005
;
if
_sometimes_
(however rarely|103356009
)
,
it
could
be
physiological|1360005
or
psychological.|60224009

The current diagnostic and statistical manual|15240007|439401001|87982008|15240007|261004008|87982008
of mental diseases|74732009
(DSM-IV

a listing
for impotence.|397803000

Treatment|276239002|416118004
depends
on the cause.|134198009

Exercise,|61686008
particularly aerobic exercise|229072005
is
an effective treatment|255403003|276239002|255403003|416118004|254648000|276239002|254648000|416118004

When
pharmacological methods|56183000|260686004|56183000|272394005
fail
,
a purpose-designed external vacuum pump|363675004|261074009|14519003
can
be
used|394850002
to
attain
erection,|60704006
with a separate compression ring|263869007|71173004|112627000|263869007|71173004|257380004|263869007|263720003|112627000|263869007|263720003|257380004
fitted|91175000|102499006
to the penis to|18911002|265793009
maintain|385630006
it.

These pumps|44668000
should
be
distinguished
from other penis pumps|74964007|18911002|44668000|74964007|265793009|44668000
(
supplied|425398004
without compression rings|71173004|257380004|263720003|257380004
)
which,
rather than
being
used|394850002
for temporary treatment|14803004|276239002|14803004|416118004
of impotence,|397803000
are
claimed
to
increase|260366006
penis length|18911002|410668003|265793009|410668003
if
used|394850002
frequently,|70232002
or
vibrate
as an aid|246088000
to masturbation.|17704007

More drastically,|242762006
inflatable
or
rigid penile implants|16046003|53996008|261026009|53996008
may
be
fitted|91175000|102499006
surgically.|83578000

Medications|410942007
carry|288345009
risk|30207005
of priapism.|6273006

All
these mechanical methods|261018001
are
based|418836005
on simple principles|13673007
of hydraulics
and
mechanics|261018001
and
are
quite reliable,
but
have
their disadvantages.

The cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterases|44180009|71211001|130108009
constitute
a group|261586004|160481000|389109008
of enzymes|90668006
that
catalyze
the hydrolysis
of the cyclic nucleotides cyclic AMP|84835006|71211001
and
cyclic GMP.|42204005

They
exist
in different molecular forms|263735002|290005005|246176004
and
are
unevenly
distributed
throughout the body.|279495008|123037004

One|421379005
of the forms|246176004
of phosphodiesterase|130108009
is
termed PDE5.

The prescription PDE5 inhibitors sildenafil|260885003|407313002|372572000
(Viagra
)
,
vardenafil|404858007
(Levitra

and
tadalafil|407111005

are
taken|419652001

,
the most common procedure|4757001|72906007|71388002
is
prosthetic implants|14789005

are
advertised

The United States Food and Drug Administration|223688001|255620007|18629005
has

During the late 16th|260383002

17th centuries
in France,|223666001
male impotence|397803000
was
considered
a crime,
as well as
legal grounds|398165009

The practice,
which
involved|248448006
inspection|32750006

by court experts,
was
declared
obscene
in 1677.[32]

Dr.|309343006

[John R.|24028007

Brinkley]

initiated
a boom
in male impotence cures|397803000
in the
US
in the 1920s
and
1930s.

His radio programs|360004001
recommended
expensive goat gland implants|125097000|362884007|40388003|388249000|362884007|40388003|362884007|40388003
and
"mercurochrome" injections|19126005|28289002|19126005|129326001

by surgeon Serge Voronoff.|304292004

Modern drug therapy|416608005
for ED|397803000|225728007
made
a significant advance|386134007|86005002
in 1983,
when
British physiologist Giles Brindley,|78841004
Ph.D.|27327002|264723009|264724003|264725002|365723003

his trousers|228205009

demonstrated
to a shocked Urodynamics Society audience|27942005|252895004
his papaverine-induced erection.|372784001|16404004|60704006

The drug Brindley|410942007
injected|422145002
into his penis|18911002|265793009
was
a non-specific vasodilator,|10003008|372787008
an alpha-blocking agent,|263660008|2899008|260872001|263660008|112232007|260872001
and
the mechanism|257544000
of action|129264002
was
clearly corporal smooth muscle relaxation.|372894003

The effect|253861007
that Brindley
discovered
established|263748003|385645004
the fundamentals
for the later development|260383002|278923009
