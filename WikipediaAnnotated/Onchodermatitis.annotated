is
a parasitic disease|17322007
caused|23981006|134198009
by infection
by _Onchocerca volvulus_,|52397001
a nematode|421727006
(roundworm|421727006|84706005
).

Onchocerciasis|38539003
is
second|81170007|257997001|288495006
in the world only
to trachoma|2576002
as an infectious cause|134198009
of blindness.

It
is
not
the nematode,|421727006
but
its endosymbiont,
_Wolbachia pipientis_,|424472003
that
causes|134198009
the severe inflammatory response|103624008
that
leaves|90737002
many blind.

The parasite|37763007
is
transmitted|60117003|258150004
to humans|278412004
through the bite|3404009|25272006
of a black fly|106779002|421049008
of the genus _Simulium_.|14280005

The larval nematodes|421727006
spread|410677005
throughout the body.|279495008|123037004

When
the worms|27601005|26089000
die|419620001|399069006|419099009
,
their _Wolbachia_ symbionts|415847004|284686001
are
released|68776005|129299003
,
triggering|410658008
a host immune system response|35024006|116003000
that
can
cause|23981006|134198009
severe itching,|24484000|424492005
and
can
destroy optical tissue|281004000|85756007
in the eye.[3]|81745001|244486005

The vast majority
of infections
occur|272120004
in sub-Saharan Africa,|409988000
although
cases|398241000|413769002
have
also
been
reported|229059009|223458004
in Yemen
and
isolated areas|46651001|42798000
of Central|26216008
and
South America.|223504005

An estimated 18 million people|414135002|125676002
suffer
from onchocerciasis,|38539003
with approximately 270,000 cases|26175008|398241000|26175008|413769002
of blindness
related|272151006|262094002
to the infection.[1]

In 1915,
Dr.|309343006

Rodolfo Robles Valverde's study|110465008|224699009
on patients|116154003
with river blindness|240842000
in Guatemala|223693003
led|88488004|236874000
to the discovery
that
the disease|64572001
is
caused|23981006|134198009
by filaria
of _O.|257971007

volvulus_,|9707006
and
sheds
light|56242006|371268001
on the life cycle|224130005|44180009
and
transmission|258150004
of the parasite.|37763007

Using|260676000
case studies|398241000|110465008|398241000|224699009
of coffee plantation workers|29263009|106541005
in Guatemala,|223693003
Robles
hypothesized
the vector|260529001
of the disease|64572001
is
a day-biting insect,|258703001|3404009|106763003|259032004|3404009|106763003
and
more specifically,|242762006
two anthropophilic species|420797005|69658003
of _Simulium_ flies|14280005|367378007
found|404684003
to
be
endemic
to the areas.|42798000

He
published
his findings|404684003
on a ?new disease?|7147002|64572001
from Guatemala|223693003
associated|47429007
with subcutaneous nodules,|95325000

)
lesions,
dermatitis,|182782007
and
microfilariae|2105009
in 1917.[6]

Treatment|276239002|416118004
may
involve|248448006
the use|277889008|419385000
of the drug ivermectin.|410942007|387559003

For best effect,|253861007
entire communities|255503000|133928008|260232004|133928008
are
treated|28995006
at the same time.|262126009|410669006

Since
final hosts|42796001
of _O.|257971007

volvulus_|9707006
are
restricted|263856008
to primates,|388073004
it

first-stage larvae|258215001

Other drugs|74964007|410942007
are
also available,|103328004
including|55919000
the tetracycline-class antibiotic doxycycline,|282831004|258391009|372478003
which
kills|248007002
the _Wolbachia_|415847004
and
renders
the female|248152002|224526002

sterile.|261029002|15296000

The removal|118292001|128303001

Ocular involvement|81745001|248448006|281004000|248448006|248448006
provides
the common name|72906007
associated|47429007
with onchocerciasis,|38539003
river blindness,|240842000
and
may
involve|248448006
any part|260726005
of the eye|81745001|244486005
from conjunctiva|29445007|181161008
and
cornea|28726007|181162001
to uvea|74862005

including|55919000
the retina|5665001|181171005

optic nerve.|18234004|180938001

The microfilariae|2105009
migrate
to the surface|410678000
of the cornea.|28726007|181162001

Punctate keratitis|416069001
occurs|272120004
in the infected area.|42798000

This clears|84989007|263707001
up
as
the inflammation subsides.|257552002

However,
if
the infection
is
chronic, sclerosing keratitis|90734009|417290008
can
occur|272120004
,
making
the affected area|247591002|42798000|248448006|42798000
become
opaque.|125149003|134295003

Over time,|410669006
the entire cornea|181162001
may
become
opaque,|125149003|134295003
thus
leading|236874000
to blindness.

Some evidence|18669006
suggests
the effect|253861007
on the cornea|28726007|181162001
is
caused|23981006|134198009
by an immune response|35024006
to bacteria present|409822003|52101004|409822003|246105001

after undergoing treatment|276239002|416118004
of onchocerciasis|38539003
with the medication diethylcarbamazine (DEC).|410942007|387340001

Mazzotti reactions|430479006
can
be
life-threatening,|224130005
and
are
characterized
by fever,|386661006
urticaria,|126485001

within seven days|420359007|258703001
of treatment|276239002|416118004
of microfilariasis.

The phenomenon
is
so common|223528007|72906007
when
DEC
is
used,|394850002
this drug|410942007

Various control programs|256220008|31509003
aim
to
stop|422117008
onchocerciasis|38539003
from
being
a public health problem.|310115006|55607006

The first|255216001|232714002
was
the Onchocerciasis Control Programme (OCP),|38539003|31509003
which
was
launched
in 1974,
and
at its peak,|255587001
covered|255334000
30 million people|125676002
in 11 countries.|223369002

Through the use|277889008|419385000
of larvicide spraying|55573003
of fast-flowing rivers to|16985007|420531007|277748003|420531007

and
from 1988 onwards,
the use|277889008|419385000
of ivermectin to|387559003
treat|395077000
infected people,|125676002
the OCP|314757003
eliminated
onchocerciasis|38539003
as a public health problem.|310115006|55607006

The OCP,|314757003
a joint effort|39352004|19487008|81087007|19487008|302536002|19487008
of the World Health Organisation,|263775005|21139007
the World Bank,|257568008
the United Nations Development Programme,|386399006
and
the UN Food and Agriculture Organization,|255620007|21139007
was
considered
to
be
a success,|385669000
and
came
to an end|261782000|422117008
in 2002.

Continued monitoring ensures onchocerciasis|255238004|302805002|38539003
cannot
reinvade
the area|42798000
of the OCP.[15]|314757003

In 1992,
the Onchocerciasis Elimination Programme|38539003|63911002
for the Americas,
which also
relies
on ivermectin,|387559003
was
launched.[16]

In 1995,
the African Programme|413464008
for Onchocerciasis Control|38539003|31509003
began|255395001
covering|255334000
another 19 countries,|223369002
mainly
relying
upon the use|277889008|419385000
of ivermectin.|387559003

Its goal|410518001
is
to set up|255532002|353734004
a community-directed supply|133928008|425398004
of ivermectin|387559003
for those
who
are
infected.

In these ways,
transmission|258150004
has
declined.[17]

No vaccine to|398827000
prevent
onchocerciasis infection|38539003
is
available.|103328004

In mass drug administration (MDA) programmes,|300848003|18629005|118538004|18629005
the treatment|276239002|416118004
for onchocerciasis|38539003
is
ivermectin|387559003
(trade name|27468005
:
Mectizan
)
;
infected people|125676002
can
be
treated|28995006
with two doses|420797005|277406006
of ivermectin,|387559003
six months apart,|422218008|258706009
repeated|27582007
every three years.|421291004|258707000

The drug paralyses|410942007|44695005
and
kills|248007002
the microfilariae causing fever,|2105009|23981006|386661006
itching|424492005
,
and
possibly oedema,|60022001|423666004
arthritis|3723001
and
lymphadenopathy.|111590001|30746006

Intense skin itching|103370009|424492005
is
eventually
relieved|398004007
,
and
the progression|246453008|246450006
towards blindness
is
halted.

In addition,|260364009
while
the drug|410942007
does
not
kill|248007002
the adult worm,|133936004|27601005|133936004|37017009
it
does
prevent
them
from producing additional offspring.|260364009|160499008

The drug therefore|410942007
prevents|116699007
both
morbidity

Ivermectin treatment|387559003|276239002|387559003|416118004
is
particularly effective|255403003|254648000
because
it only|50607009|420295001
needs|410525008|103325001
to
be
taken|419652001
once
or
twice a year,|258707000|259039008
needs|410525008|103325001
no refrigeration,
and
has
a wide margin|90522003|112233002|90522003|82868003|90522003|372249001
of safety,
with the result|394617004
that
it
has
been
widely
given|419582001
by minimally trained community health workers.[18]|118629009|133928008|263775005|106541005|62193008|133928008|263775005|106541005

For the treatment|276239002|416118004
of individuals,|125676002|385435006
doxycycline|372478003
is
used to|394850002
kill|248007002
the _Wolbachia_ bacteria|415847004|409822003
that
live|419749002
in adult worms.|133936004|27601005|133936004|26089000

This adjunct therapy|276239002
has
been
shown
to significantly
lower|261122009
microfilarial loads|2105009
in the host,
and
may
have
activity|48761009|55561003|258745004|257733005
against the adult worms,|133936004|27601005|133936004|26089000
due to the symbiotic relationship|49105004|272151006
between _Wolbachia_|415847004
and
the worm.|27601005|37017009

In four separate trials|421534005|263869007|110465008
over 10 years|258707000
with various dosing regimens|256220008|277406006|256220008|408102007
of doxycycline|372478003
for individualized treatment,|276239002|416118004
doxycycline|372478003
was
found|404684003
to
be
effective|255403003|254648000
in sterilizing
the female worms|248152002|27601005|248152002|26089000|224526002|27601005|224526002|26089000
and
reducing|260400001
their numbers|410680006|410681005
over a period|259037005
of four|421534005
to six weeks.|422218008|258705008

Research
on other antibiotics,|74964007|255631004
such as rifampicin,|387159009
has
shown
it to
been
effective|255403003|254648000
in animal models|387961004
at reducing _Wolbachia_|260400001|415847004
both
as an alternative
and
as an adjunct
to doxycycline.|372478003

However,
doxycycline treatment|372478003|276239002|372478003|416118004
requires
daily dosing|69620002
for
at least four|276139006|421534005|263796003|421534005
to six weeks,|422218008|258705008
making
it more difficult|242762006|52925006
to administer|418283001
in the affected areas.[18]|247591002|42798000|248448006|42798000

Ivermectin|387559003
kills|248007002
the parasite|37763007
by
interfering|78235001
with the nervous system|25087005|278196006
and
muscle function,|78718001
in particular,
by enhancing inhibitory neurotransmission.|61511001|55859003

The drug|410942007
binds|257768005
to
and
activates
glutamate-gated chloride channels.|430503006|50213009|255592004|430503006|255592004|104697004|50213009|255592004|104697004|255592004

These channels,|255592004
present|52101004|246105001
in neurons|47220008
and
myocytes,
are
not
invertebrate-|272608008
specific,|69658003
but
are
protected
in vertebrates|387967000
from the action|129264002
of ivermectin|387559003
by the blood?brain barrier.|20245001

Ivermectin|387559003
is
thought to irreversibly|88952004
activate
these channel receptors|255592004|116647005
in the worm,|27601005|37017009
eventually
causing|23981006
an inhibitory postsynaptic potential.|70054006

The chance
of a future action potential|129264002|30207005
occurring|272120004
in synapses|69147006
between neurons|47220008
decreases|260370003
and
the nematodes|421727006
experience
flaccid paralysis|39157001
followed|367409002
by death.[22][23][24]|419620001|264657009|268923008|264657009

Ivermectin|387559003
is
directly effective|255403003|254648000
against the larval stage microfilariae|21191007|2105009|371508000|2105009|261612004|2105009
of _O.|257971007

volvulus_|9707006
;
they
are
paralyzed|44695005
and
can
be
killed|248007002
by eosinophils|14793004|365601007
and
macrophages.|58986001

It
does
not
kill|248007002
adult females|224526002
(macrofilariae
)
,
but
does
cause|23981006|134198009
them to
cease
releasing microfilariae,|129299003|2105009
perhaps
by paralyzing|44695005
the reproductive tract.[18]

Since 1988,
ivermectin|387559003
has
been
provided free|37837009
of charge
for use|277889008|419385000
in humans|278412004
by Merck
through the Mectizan donation program (MDP).

The MDP
works|261041009
together with ministries of health|263775005
and
nongovernmental development organisations,|278923009|21139007
such as the World Health Organization,|263775005|21139007
to
provide
free ivermectin|37837009|387559003
to those
who
need|410525008|103325001
it
in endemic areas.[25]|42798000

A study|110465008|224699009
of 2501 people|125676002
in Ghana|223557006
showed
the prevalence rate
doubled|1305003
between 2000
and
2005
despite treatment,|276239002|416118004
suggesting
the parasite|37763007
is
developing
resistance|30714006
to the drug.|410942007

A clinical trial|110465008
of another antiparasitic agent,|333032003
moxidectin
(
manufactured
by Wyeth,
began|255395001
on July 1,
2009
(NCT00790998.[28]

About 99%
of onchocerciasis cases|38539003|398241000|38539003|413769002
occur|272120004
in Africa.|223498002

As of 2008,
about 18 million people|125676002
were
infected
with this parasite|37763007
;
about 300,000
of those
had
been
permanently
blinded.

Onchocerciasis|38539003
is
currently endemic|15240007
in 30 African countries,|223508008
Yemen,
and
isolated regions|46651001|410673009
of South America.|223504005

Over 85 million people|125676002
live|419749002
in endemic areas,|42798000
and
half
of these
reside
in Nigeria.|223565009

Another 120 million people|125676002
are
at risk|410519009
for contracting|78558002
the disease.|64572001

Due to the vector?s|260529001
breeding
habitat,
the disease|64572001
is
more severe|242762006|24484000
along the major rivers|255603008|420531007
in the northern
and
central areas|26216008|42798000
of the continent,|261001000|223497007
and
severity|272141005
declines
in villages farther|224806006|46053002
from rivers._[citation|420531007

_] Travelers
who
do
not
stay
long|255511005
in those areas|42798000
have
little risk|30207005
of developing
the disease,|64572001
as
it
requires
prolonged exposure|255224006|71677004|255224006|24932003
to the fly bites|283345006
and
parasite introduction.|37763007|107733003

According to a 2002
WHO
report|229059009|223458004
,
onchocerciasis|38539003
has
not
caused|23981006|134198009
a single death,|125681006|419620001|125681006|268923008|50607009|419620001|50607009|268923008
but
its global burden|60132005
is
987,000 disability adjusted life years (DALYs).|21134002|410617001|224130005|258707000

The severe pruritus alone accounts|24484000|424492005|105529008
for 60%
of the DALYs.

Infection
reduces|260400001
the host?s immunity|58915005
and
resistance|30714006
to other diseases,|74964007|64572001
which
results|394617004
in an estimated reduction in life expectancy|414135002|58294000|224130005|410517006|414135002|260400001|224130005|410517006|414135002|289928003|224130005|410517006
of 13 years.[30]|258707000

Animal models|387961004
for the disease|64572001
are
somewhat
limited|255469002
,
as
the parasite only|37763007
lives|224130005
in primates,|388073004
but
there
are
close parallels.|29179001

_Litomosoides sigmodontis_ ,|33538008
