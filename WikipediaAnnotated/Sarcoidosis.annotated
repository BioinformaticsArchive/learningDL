is
a disease|64572001
in which abnormal collections|263654008
of chronic inflammatory cells|90734009|256923004
(granulomas|45647009
form|246176004
as nodules|27925004|279365004
in multiple organs.|260396001|410653004

The cause|134198009
of sarcoidosis|31541009
is
unknown.|261665006

The granulomas|45647009
that
appear
are
usually
not
of the necrotizing variety|255310005
and
are
most often|4757001|70232002
located
in the lungs|39607008
or
the lymph nodes,|59441001
but
virtually
any organ|410653004
can
be
affected.|247591002|248448006

Normally,
the onset|77374008
is
gradual.|255343009

Sarcoidosis|31541009
may
be
asymptomatic|84387000
or
chronic.|90734009

It commonly
improves|385425000|3442003|385633008
or
clears|84989007|263707001
up spontaneously.

More
than two-thirds|420797005|70905002
of people|125676002
with lung sarcoidosis|24369008
have
no symptoms
after 9 years.|258707000

About 50%
have
relapses.|263855007

About 10%
develop
serious disability.|42745003|21134002

Lung scarring|39607008|39607008|275322007|181216001|181216001|275322007

infection
may
lead|88488004
to respiratory failure|409622000
and
death.|419620001|268923008

Chronic patients|90734009|116154003

deal
with waxing|69637009|41508009

waning symptoms
over many years.[2]|258707000

Sarcoidosis,|31541009
as
a systemic inflammatory disease,|264578000|31099001|128139000
can
affect|4065008
any organ.|410653004

Common symptoms|72906007
are
vague,|25615006
such as fatigue|84229001
unchanged|260388006
by sleep,|258158006
lack|41277001
of energy,|248272003
weight loss,|89362005

pains,|22253000
arthritis,|3723001
dry eyes,|1249004

of the knees,|304679005
blurry vision,|246636008
shortness|359530003|367450005
of breath,|11891009
a dry, hacking cough,|409596002
or
skin lesions.|95324001

Sarcoidosis|31541009
and
cancer|363346000|372087000
may
mimic
one|421379005
another,
making
the distinction
difficult.|52925006

The cutaneous symptoms|308926009
vary
,
and
range
from rashes|271807003
and
noduli|279365004
(small bumps|255507004
)
to erythema nodosum|32861005
or
lupus pernio.|72470008

It
is
often asymptomatic.|70232002|84387000

The combination|89780004
of erythema nodosum,|32861005
bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy,|51440002|87500009
and
arthralgia|57676002
is
called L?fgren syndrome
;
it
has
a relatively good prognosis.|170968001

or
brain involvement|12738006|248448006|258335003|248448006

cause|23981006|134198009
further symptoms|46053002
and
altered functioning.|246464006

Pulmonary localization|39607008|257880008|264164005|257880008
is
by far|46053002
the most common|4757001|72906007
in individuals|125676002|385435006
with sarcoidosis.|31541009

About 90%|264705001|264703008
of patients|116154003
have
an abnormal chest X-ray|168734001
at some time|410669006
during the course|288524001
of their disease.|64572001

Overall,
about 50%
develop
permanent pulmonary abnormalities,|6934004|39607008|276654001|6934004|264164005|276654001
and
5
to 15%
have
progressive fibrosis|255314001|263756000
of the lung parenchyma.|113255004|201712001

Sarcoidosis|31541009
of the lung|39607008|181216001
is
primarily
an interstitial lung disease|51615001|233703007
in which
the inflammatory process|415178003
involves|248448006
the alveoli,
small bronchi,|255507004|955009
and
small blood vessels.|27915009

In acute|272118002
and
subacute cases,|19939008|398241000|19939008|413769002
physical examination usually|5880005
reveals|263857004
dry rales.[6]|13880007|48409008

Although
liver biopsy|86259008
reveals|263857004
liver involvement|258322007
in 60
to 90%|264705001|264703008
of cases,|398241000|413769002
liver dysfunction|75183008
is
usually
not important clinically.

About 20?30%
have
hepatomegaly|80515008
and/or
biochemical evidence|80534008|18669006
of liver involvement.|258322007

Usually,
these changes|243326001|263703002
reflect|225436004
a cholestatic pattern|33688009|272135003
and
include|55919000
an elevated alkaline phosphatase level|274770006|258395000|274770006|276625007|75540009|365771003

Jaundice|18165001
is
rare.[6]|84638005|103356009

Sarcoidosis|31541009
involves|248448006
the skin|119325001|39937001|181469002
in about 25%
of patients.|116154003

The most common lesions|4757001|72906007
are
erythema nodosum,|32861005
plaques,|38551001
maculopapular eruptions,|247471006
subcutaneous nodules,|95325000
and
lupus pernio.|72470008

Treatment|276239002|416118004
is
not
required
,
since
the lesions usually
resolve
spontaneously
in two|420797005
to four weeks.|421534005|258705008

Although
it
may
be
disfiguring,
cutaneous sarcoidosis rarely|55941000|103356009
causes|134198009
major problems.[6]|255603008|55607006

Although
cardiac involvement|80891009|248448006
is
present|52101004|246105001
in 20%
to 30%
of patients|116154003

only about 5%|50607009|420295001
of patients|116154003
with systemic sarcoidosis|31099001|31541009
are
symptomatic.|264931009

The presentation|246105001
of cardiac sarcoidosis|75403004
can
range
from asymptomatic conduction abnormalities|84387000|36358004
to fatal ventricular arrhythmia.|399166001|44103008

Myocardial sarcoidosis|74281007|31541009

The exact cause|134198009
of sarcoidosis|31541009
is
not
known.|36692007

The current working hypothesis|15240007|261041009
is
,
in genetically susceptible individuals,|131196009|125676002|131196009|385435006
sarcoidosis|31541009
is
caused|23981006|134198009
through alteration
to the immune response|35024006
after exposure|71677004|24932003
to an environmental, occupational,|276339004|87923000
or
infectious agent.[20]|36272005

Investigations|386053000
of genetic susceptibility|47708004
yielded
many candidate genes,|67271001
but
only
few
were
confirmed|59156000
by further investigations|46053002|386053000
and
no reliable genetic markers|20889005
are
known.|36692007

Currently,|15240007
the most interesting candidate gene|4757001|225469004|67271001
is
_BTNL2_
;
several _HLA-DR_ risk alleles|261028005|62038004|30207005|9109004
are
also
being
investigated.|116698004

In persistent sarcoidosis,|31541009
the HLA haplotype _HLA-B7-DR15_|8486005

either
cooperating
in disease|64572001
or
another gene|67271001

metastatic disease,|77879006|64572001
lymphoma,|118600007
septic emboli,|72237000
rheumatoid nodules,|402426007
Wegener's granulomatosis,|239934006
varicella infection,|38907003
and
atypical infections,|112231000
such as _Mycobacterium avium_ complex,|373436002
cytomegalovirus,|407444007
and
cryptococci.|89912005

Sarcoidosis|31541009
is
confused most commonly|286933003
with neoplastic diseases,|108369006|55342001
such as lymphoma,|118600007
or
with disorders|64572001
characterized
also
by a mononuclear cell granulomatous inflammatory process,|30545007|6266001
such as the mycobacterial|243368001
and
fungal disorders.[6]|414561005|64572001

Because of the wide range|90522003
of possible manifestations,|371930009|250255003|371930009|251190009|60022001|250255003|60022001|251190009
the investigations to|386053000
confirm|59156000
diagnosis|439401001
may
involve|248448006
many organs|410653004
and
methods,|260686004|272394005
depending
on initial presentation.|260916006

Very often,|260358002|70232002
sarcoidosis|31541009
presents|52101004|246105001
as a restrictive disease|64572001
of the lungs,|39607008
causing|23981006
a decrease|260400001|260370003
in lung volume|17785005
and
decreased compliance|1250004|405078008|260400001|405078008|260371004|405078008
(
the ability to|371150009
stretch|122546009
)
;
hence,
chest X-ray|399208008
and
other methods|272394005
are
used|394850002
to
assess
the severity|272141005
or
rule|10828004
out pulmonary disease.|255529000|19829001

The disease typically|64572001
limits|255469002
the amount|107651007
of air|417696007
drawn
into the lungs,|39607008
but
produces
higher|75540009|371879000
than normal expiratory flow ratios.|17621005|58322009|118586006|258744000|58322009|118586006

The vital capacity|268379003|252474003
(full breath|261015003|11891009
in,
to full breath out|261015003|11891009
)
is
decreased,|1250004|260400001|260371004
and
most
of this air|417696007
can
be
blown|387085005
out
in the first second.|255216001|81170007|255216001|257997001|255216001|288495006|232714002|81170007|232714002|257997001|232714002|288495006

This means|255586005
the FEV1/FVC ratio|59328004|268379003|118586006
is
increased|35105006|260366006
from the normal|17621005|258744000
of about 80%,
to 90%.|264705001|264703008

Obstructive lung changes,|371072008|243326001|371072008|263703002
causing|23981006
a decrease|260400001|260370003
in the amount|107651007
of air|417696007
that
can
be
exhaled|58322009
,
may
occur|272120004
when
enlarged lymph nodes|30746006
in the chest compress airways|261179002|37204000|43725001|261179002|37204000|89187006
or
when
internal inflammation|260521003|257552002
or
nodules|27925004|279365004
impede
airflow.|4601000

Chest X-ray changes|399208008|243326001|399208008|263703002
are
divided|422033008
into four stages|421534005|261612004
:
[46]

Although
patients|116154003
with stage 1 X-rays|258215001|258215001|52250000|258215001|168537006
tend
to
have
the acute|272118002
or
subacute, reversible form|19939008|35174006|246176004
of the disease,|64572001
those
with stages 2|258219007
and
3 often|260313008|70232002
have
the chronic, progressive disease|27624003|255314001
;
these patterns|272135003
do
not
represent
consecutive "
stages|261612004
"
of sarcoidosis.|31541009

Thus,
except for epidemiologic purposes,|363675004
this X-ray categorization|73504009|52250000|73504009|168537006|73504009|363680008|73504009
is
mostly
of historic interest.[6]|225469004|392521001|225469004

Investigations to|386053000
assess
involvement|248448006
of other organs frequently|74964007|410653004|70232002
involve|248448006
electrocardiogram,|29303009
ocular examination|81745001|5880005|281004000|5880005|5880005
by an ophthalmologist,|422234006
liver function tests,|26958001
renal function tests,|44277000
serum calcium,|271240001
and
24-hour urine calcium.|123027009|73668004|259029002|73668004

In sarcoidosis presenting|31541009|246105001
in the Caucasian population,|413773004|385436007|413773004|389109008|185984009|385436007|185984009|389109008
hilar adenopathy|111590001|30746006
and
erythema nodosum|32861005
are
the most common initial symptoms.|4757001|72906007|884001|4757001|72906007|232714002

In this population,|385436007|389109008
a biopsy|86273004
of the gastrocnemius muscle|35616000
is
a useful tool|86967005
in correctly
diagnosing|439401001
the patient.|116154003

The presence|386397008
of a noncaseating epithelioid granuloma|45647009
in a gastrocnemius specimen|35616000|123038009|181700004|123038009
is
definitive evidence|261002007|18669006
of sarcoidosis,|31541009
as
other tuberculoid|74964007|371569005
and
fungal diseases extremely rarely|3218000|103356009
present|52101004|246105001
histologically|67151002
in this muscle.[47]|91727004

In female patients,|248152002|116154003|224526002|116154003
sarcoidosis|31541009
is
significantly
associated|47429007
with hypothyroidism,|40930008
hyperthyroidism|34486009
and
other thyroid diseases,|74964007|14304000
hence
close|29179001
surveillance|225419007
of thyroid function|69748006|246464006|61020000|246464006
is
recommended.[34]

Sarcoidosis|31541009
may
be
divided|422033008
into the following types|255260001|261664005
:
[19]
:
708-11

Between 30
and
70%
of patients|116154003
do
not
require
therapy.|276239002

For patients|116154003
presenting|246105001
with lung symptoms,|39607008|181216001
unless
the respiratory impairment|258162000|40226000|449071006|40226000
is
devastating,
active pulmonary sarcoidosis|55561003|24369008
is
observed usually
without therapy|276239002
for two|420797005
to three months|421291004|258706009
;
if
the inflammation|257552002
does
not
subside
spontaneously,
therapy|276239002
is
instituted.|385437003

Corticosteroids,|79440004
most commonly prednisolone,|116601002
have
been
the standard treatment|276239002|416118004
for many years.|258707000

In some patients,|116154003
this treatment|276239002|416118004
can
slow|419443000
or
reverse
the course|288524001
of the disease,|64572001
but
other patients|74964007|116154003
do
not
respond
to steroid therapy.|297279009

The use|277889008|419385000
of corticosteroids|79440004
in mild disease|255604002|64572001
is
controversial because
in many cases|398241000|413769002
the disease|64572001
remits|255319006
spontaneously.

Additionally,
corticosteroids|79440004
have
many recognized dose-|277406006|408102007
and
duration-related side effects,|103335007|272151006|103335007|262094002
and
their use|277889008|419385000
is
generally
limited|255469002
to severe, progressive,|24484000|255314001
or
organ-threatening disease.|410653004|64572001

The influence
of corticosteroids|79440004
or
other immunosuppressants|74964007|372823004
on the natural history|510009|510009|392521001
is
unclear.

Severe symptoms|162470006
are
generally
treated|28995006
with steroids,|116566001
and
steroid-sparing agents|116566001|260872001
such as azathioprine|372574004
and
methotrexate|387381009
are
often|70232002
used.|394850002

Rarely,|103356009
cyclophosphamide|387420009
has
also
been
used.|394850002

As the granulomas|45647009
are
caused|23981006|134198009
by collections
of immune system cells,|116003000|4421005
particularly T cells,|57184004
there
has
been
some early indications|264499004|410666004
of success|385669000
using|260676000
immunosuppressants,|372823004
interleukin-2 inhibitors,|428693003|61511001
or
antitumor necrosis factor-alpha treatment|6574001|263660008|276239002|6574001|263660008|416118004
(
such as infliximab.|386891004

Unfortunately,
none|260413007
of these
has
provided reliable treatment,|276239002|416118004
and
there
can
be
significant side effects|386134007
such as an increased risk|35105006|30207005|260366006|30207005
of reactivating latent tuberculosis.|59086009|44104002|371569005

Antitumor necrosis factor-alpha treatment|6574001|263660008|276239002|6574001|263660008|416118004
with etanercept|387045004
in rheumatoid arthritis|69896004
has
been
observed
to
cause|23981006|134198009
sarcoidosis.[42]|31541009

Because
sarcoidosis|31541009
can
affect|4065008
multiple organ systems,|260396001|91689009
follow-up|308273005
on a patient|116154003
with sarcoidosis|31541009
should
always
include|55919000
an electrocardiogram,|29303009
ocular examination|81745001|5880005|281004000|5880005|5880005
by an ophthalmologist,|422234006
liver function tests,|26958001
serum calcium,|271240001
and
24-hour urine calcium.[34]|123027009|73668004|259029002|73668004

The disease|64572001
can
remit|255319006
spontaneously
or
become chronic,|90734009
with exacerbations
and
remissions.|277022003

In some patients,|116154003
it
can
progress|385651009
to pulmonary fibrosis|51615001
and
death.|419620001|268923008

About half
of the cases|398241000|413769002
resolve
without treatment|276239002|416118004
or
can
be
cured
within 12?36 months,|258706009
and
most
within five years.|421820001|258707000

Some cases|398241000|413769002
persist
several decades.|261028005

When
the heart|80891009|302509004
is
involved,|248448006
the prognosis|20481000
is
poor.|11403006|255351007

Patients|116154003
with sarcoidosis|31541009
appear
to
be
at significantly increased risk|35105006|30207005|260366006|30207005
for cancer,|363346000|372087000
in particular lung cancer,|363358000
malignant lymphomas,|118600007
[51]
and
cancer|363346000|372087000
in other organs|74964007|410653004
known|36692007
to
be
affected|247591002|248448006
in sarcoidosis.|31541009

In sarcoidosis-lymphoma syndrome,|31541009|118600007
sarcoidosis|31541009
is
followed|367409002
by the development|278923009
of a lymphoproliferative disorder|414629003
such as non-Hodgkin lymphoma.|118601006

This
may
be
attributed|246061005
to the underlying immunological abnormalities|37523008|276654001
that
occur|272120004
during the sarcoidosis disease process.|31541009|64572001|415178003

Sarcoidosis|31541009
can
also
follow|367409002|421939007
cancer [55]|363346000|264691008|372087000|264691008
or
occur|272120004
concurrently
with cancer.|363346000|372087000

There
have
been
reports|229059009|223458004
of hairy cell leukemia,|118613001
[58] acute myeloid leukemia,|413443009
[59]
and
acute myeloblastic leukemia [60]|413443009
associated|47429007
with sarcoidosis.|31541009

Sarcoidosis most commonly|31541009
affects|4065008
young adults|84422007|133936004
of
both
sexes,|258139002|365952006|263495000|70256003|57312000
although
studies|110465008|224699009
have
reported|229059009|223458004
more cases|242762006|398241000|242762006|413769002
in females.|248152002

Incidence
is
highest|75540009|371879000
for individuals|125676002|385435006
younger|84422007
than 40|259031006
and
peaks|255587001
in the age-group|424144002|261586004|424144002|160481000|424144002|389109008
from 20
to 29 years|258707000
;
a second peak|81170007|255587001|257997001|255587001|288495006|255587001
is
observed
for women|224526002
over 50.[48][50]

Sarcoidosis|31541009
occurs|272120004
throughout the world
in all races|415229000
with an average incidence
of 16.5
per 100,000
in men|339947000
and
19
per 100,000
in women.|224526002

The disease|64572001
is
most prevalent|4757001
in Northern European countries|223633000
and
the highest annual incidence|75540009|53281000|371879000|53281000
of 60
per 100,000
is
found|404684003
in Sweden|223681007
and
Iceland.|223667005

In the United Kingdom|223860005
the prevalence
is
16
in 100,000.

In the United States,|223688001
sarcoidosis|31541009
is
more common|242762006|72906007
in people|125676002
of African descent|413464008
than Caucasians,|413773004|185984009
with annual incidence|53281000
reported|229059009|223458004
as 35.5
and
10.9
per 100,000,
respectively.

Sarcoidosis|31541009
is
less commonly|276139006|263796003
reported|229059009|223458004
in South America,|223504005
Spain,|223680008
India,|223600005
Canada,|223686002
and
the Philippines.|223592003

There
may
be
a higher susceptibility|75540009|76522002|75540009|118588007|371879000|76522002|371879000|118588007
to sarcoidosis|31541009
in those with coeliac disease.|20401003|396331005|421463005|396331005

An association|263534001|272151006
between the two disorders|420797005|64572001
has
been
suggested.[63]

The differing incidence
across the world
may
be
at least partially attributable|276139006|263796003
to the lack|41277001
of screening programs|20135006
in certain regions|17162000|410673009
of the world,
and
the overshadowing presence|386397008
of other granulomatous diseases,|74964007|128561003
such as tuberculosis,|371569005
that
may
interfere|78235001
with the diagnosis|439401001
of sarcoidosis|31541009
where they
are
prevalent.

There
may
also
be
differences|263735002
in the severity|272141005
of the disease|64572001
between people|125676002
of different ethnicities.|263735002|397731000

Several studies|261028005|110465008|261028005|224699009
suggest
the presentation|246105001
in people|125676002
of African origin|160514004
may
be
more severe|242762006|24484000
and
disseminated|65709003
than
for Caucasians,|413773004|185984009
who
are
more likely to|242762006|2931005
have
asymptomatic disease.[64]|84387000|64572001

Manifestation|250255003|251190009
appears
to
be
slightly different|425404009|263735002
according to race|415229000
and
sex.|258139002|365952006|263495000|70256003|57312000

Erythema nodosum|32861005
is
far more common|46053002|72906007
in men|339947000
than
in women|224526002
and
in Caucasians|413773004|185984009
than
in other races.

In Japanese patients,|414551003|116154003
ophthalmologic|394594003|239005
and
cardiac involvement|80891009|248448006
are
more common|242762006|72906007
than
in other races.[48]

Sarcoidosis|31541009
is
one|421379005
of the few pulmonary diseases|57176003|19829001
with a higher prevalence|75540009|371879000
in nonsmokers.[65]|8392000|264695004

Sarcoidosis generally|31541009
does
not
prevent
successful pregnancy|385669000|289908002
and
delivery|236973005|118215003
;
the endogenous estrogen|73979006|61946003
in pregnancy|289908002
may
even
have
a slightly beneficial immunomodulatory effect.|425404009|427067006|253861007|425404009|372558009|253861007

In most cases,|398241000|413769002
the course|288524001
of the disease|64572001
is
unaffected
by pregnancy,|289908002
with improvement
in a few cases|57176003|398241000|57176003|413769002
and
worsening|230993007|231877006
of symptoms
in very few cases.[29]|260358002|398241000|260358002|413769002

Autoimmune disorders,|85828009
including|55919000
sarcoidosis,|31541009
are
listed
as a significant risk factor|386134007|80943009
for developing pre-eclampsia,|15394000
a hypertensive complication|116223007|263718001
of the second|81170007|257997001|288495006
and/or
third trimesters|255248002
of pregnancy.|289908002

Pre-eclampsia|15394000
is
a high-risk condition|15508007|260905004
and
the patient|116154003
should
be
referred|439980006
to a maternal/fetal health expert,|72705000|263775005
or
perinatologist.
