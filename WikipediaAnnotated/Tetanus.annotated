(
from Ancient Greek|1451003
: ??????? _tetanos_ "taut",
and ??????? _teinein_ "to
stretch|122546009
"
)
[1]|260305007
is
a medical condition|74188005|260905004
characterized
by a prolonged contraction|255224006|78558002
of skeletal muscle fibers.|80985008

The primary symptoms|63161005|261424001
are
caused|23981006|134198009
by tetanospasmin,|418794003
a neurotoxin|363642007
produced
by the Gram-positive, rod-shaped,|416634002|107644003|416634002|300842002
obligate
anaerobic bacterium _Clostridium tetani_.[2]|59343002|30917009|59343002|58098008

Infection generally
occurs|272120004
through wound contamination|13924000
and
often|70232002
involves|248448006
a cut|283396008
or
deep puncture wound.|262566000

As the infection progresses,|385651009
muscle spasms|45352006
develop
in the jaw|661005|181811001
(thus
the name "lockjaw"|240432006
)
and
elsewhere
in the body.|279495008|123037004

Infection
can
be
prevented|116699007
by proper immunization|127785005
and
by post-exposure prophylaxis.[3]|409516001

Tetanus often|76902006|70232002
begins|255395001
with mild spasms|255604002|45352006
in the jaw muscles|661005|91727004|181811001|91727004
(lockjaw|240432006
).

The spasms|45352006
can
also
affect|4065008
the chest,|261179002
neck,|45048000|302550007
back,
and
abdominal muscles.|28720001

Back muscle spasms often|203095000|70232002
cause|23981006|134198009
arching,|9089003
called opisthotonos.|8652009

Sometimes
the spasms|45352006
affect|4065008
muscles|91727004
that
help
with breathing,|14910006|258162000
which
can
lead|88488004
to breathing problems.[3]|386813002

Prolonged muscular action|255224006|91727004|129264002|255224006|263816006|129264002
causes|134198009
sudden, powerful,|255363002|33300005
and
painful contractions|22253000|78558002
of muscle groups.|91727004|261586004|91727004|160481000

This
is
called tetany.|10629009

These episodes|272128006
can
cause|23981006|134198009
fractures|125605004
and
muscle tears.|262966007

Other symptoms|74964007
include|55919000
drooling,|62718007
excessive sweating,|52613005
fever,|386661006
hand|85562004|302539009
or
foot spasms,|56459004|45352006|259051005|45352006|302545001|45352006
irritability,|55929007
swallowing|54731003|288937009
difficulty,|371157007
uncontrolled urination|19032002|28278009
or
defecation._[citation|111989001

Tetanus|76902006
affects|4065008
skeletal muscle,|127954009|244716004
a type|261664005
of striated muscle|127954009|118252003
used|394850002
in voluntary movement.|255375007|255324009

The other type|74964007|261664005
of striated muscle,|127954009|118252003
cardiac|80891009
or
heart muscle,|74281007
cannot
be
tetanized
because of its intrinsic electrical properties.|260521003|18213006|370130000|260521003|18213006|116685008|260521003|258096005|370130000|260521003|258096005|116685008|255406006|18213006|370130000|255406006|18213006|116685008|255406006|258096005|370130000|255406006|258096005|116685008

Mortality rates|409651001
reported|229059009|223458004
vary
from 48%
to 73%.

In recent years,|6493001|258707000
_[
when?_] approximately 11%|26175008
of reported tetanus cases|229059009|76902006|398241000|229059009|76902006|413769002|223458004|76902006|398241000|223458004|76902006|413769002
have
been
fatal.|399166001

The highest mortality rates|75540009|409651001|371879000|409651001
are
in unvaccinated people|125676002
and
people|125676002
over 60 years|258707000
of age.[3]|424144002

The incubation period|406646006
of tetanus|76902006
may
be
up to several months|261028005|258706009
but
is
usually
about eight days.|421825006|258703001

In general,|60132005
the further|46053002
the injury site|10546003
is
from the central nervous system,|21483005|278199004
the longer|255511005
the incubation period.|406646006

The shorter|359530003|367450005
the incubation period,|406646006
the more severe|242762006|24484000
the symptoms.

In neonatal tetanus,|255407002|76902006
symptoms usually
appear
from 4|260308009
to 14 days|258703001
after birth,|237679004|3950001|288563008|3950001
averaging
about 7 days.|258703001

On the basis|418836005
of clinical findings,|404684003
four different forms|421534005|263735002|246176004
of tetanus|76902006
have
been
described.[3]

This
is
the most common type|4757001|72906007|261664005
of tetanus,|76902006
representing
about 80%
of cases.|398241000|413769002

The generalized form usually|60132005|246176004
presents|52101004|246105001
with a descending pattern.|75294000|272135003

The first sign|276131009
is
trismus,|87866006
or
lockjaw,|240432006
and
the facial spasms|32402008
called
risus sardonicus,|64314006
followed|367409002
by stiffness|271587009
of the neck,|45048000|302550007
difficulty|371157007
in swallowing,|54731003|288937009
and
rigidity|16046003
of pectoral
and
calf muscles.|392565009

Other symptoms|74964007
include|55919000
elevated temperature,|386661006
sweating|161857006
,
elevated blood pressure,|24184005
and
episodic rapid heart rate.|278499009|3424008

Spasms|45352006
may
occur|272120004
frequently|70232002
and
last
for several minutes|261028005|258701004|261028005|255507004|261028005|356624006
with the body|279495008|123037004
shaped|107644003|300842002
into a characteristic form called opisthotonos.|246176004|8652009

Spasms|45352006
continue|255238004
for
up to 4 weeks,|260308009|258705008
and
complete recovery|255594003
may
take|419652001
months._[citation|258706009
needed|410525008|103325001

This
is
a form|246176004
of generalized tetanus|240434007
that
occurs|272120004
in newborns.|133933007

Infants|418119000
who
have
not
acquired|255396000
passive immunity|112122005
because
the mother|72705000
has
never
been
immunized
are
at risk.|410519009

It usually
occurs|272120004
through infection
of the unhealed umbilical stump,|78220002|38033009
particularly
when
the stump|38033009
is
cut|283396008
with a non-sterile instrument.|261029002|57134006|15296000|57134006

Neonatal tetanus|255407002|76902006
is
common|72906007
in many developing countries|223369002
and
is
responsible|394851003
for about 14%
(215,000
)
of all neonatal deaths,|276506001
but
is
very rare|260358002|84638005|260358002|103356009
in developed countries.[7]|223369002

This
is
an uncommon form|103356009|246176004
of the disease,|64572001
in which patients|116154003
have
persistent contraction|78558002
of muscles|91727004
in the same anatomic area|262126009|36298004|42798000
as the injury.

The contractions|78558002
may
persist
for many weeks|258705008
before
gradually subsiding.

Local tetanus|255470001|76902006
is
generally milder|255604002
;
only about 1%|50607009|420295001
of cases|398241000|413769002
are
fatal,|399166001
but
it
may
precede|236874000
the onset|77374008
of generalized tetanus._[citation|240434007
needed|410525008|103325001
_]

This
is
a rare form[8]|84638005|246176004|103356009|246176004
of the disease,|64572001
occasionally
occurring|272120004
with otitis media|65363002
(ear infections|129127001
)
in which _C.

tetani_|10629009
is
present|52101004|246105001
in the flora
of the middle ear,|25342003|181185000
or
following injuries|255260001
to the head.|69536005|302548004

There
is
involvement|248448006
of the cranial nerves,|25238003
especially
in the facial area._[citation|89545001|42798000
needed|410525008|103325001
_]

It
is
caused|23981006|134198009
by the tetanus bacterium _Clostridium tetani_.|76902006|409822003|30917009|76902006|409822003|58098008

Tetanus|76902006
is
often|70232002
associated|47429007
with rust,|106563001|405715007
especially rusty nails,|106563001|72651009|405715007|72651009
but
this concept
is
somewhat misleading.

Objects|260787004
that
accumulate
rust|106563001|405715007
are
often found outdoors,|70232002|404684003|70232002
or
in
places|257557008
that harbor anaerobic bacteria,|257621007|59343002
but
the rust|106563001|405715007
itself
does
not
cause|23981006|134198009
tetanus|76902006
nor
does
it
contain|42504009
more _C.|242762006

tetani_ bacteria.|10629009|409822003

The rough surface|410678000
of rusty metal merely|106563001|425620007|405715007|425620007
provides
a prime habitat
for a _C.

tetani_ endospore to|10629009|46994008
reside
,
and
the nail|72651009|119327009
affords
a means to|255586005
puncture|11639007|85921004
skin|119325001|39937001|181469002
and
deliver
endospore|46994008
into the wound.|13924000

An endospore|46994008
is
a non-metabolizing survival
structure
that
begins|255395001
to
metabolize
and
cause infection|134198009
once
in an adequate environment.|51117008|276339004|88323005|276339004

Because _C.

tetani_|10629009
is
an anaerobic bacterium,|59343002
it
and
its endospores|46994008
survive
well|20572008
in an environment|276339004
that
lacks|41277001
oxygen.|24099007

Hence,
stepping|27253007
on a nail|72651009|119327009
(rusty|106563001|405715007
or
not
)
may
result|394617004
in a tetanus infection,|76902006
as
the low-oxygen|62482003|24099007|371880002|24099007
(anaerobic
)
environment|276339004
is
provided
by the same object|262126009|260787004
that
causes|134198009
a puncture wound,|11639007
delivering
endospores|46994008
to a suitable environment|276339004
for growth.

There
are
currently|15240007
no blood tests|252275004
that
can
be
used|394850002
to
diagnose|439401001
tetanus.|76902006

The diagnosis|439401001
is
based|418836005
on the presentation|246105001
of tetanus symptoms|76902006
and
does
not
depend
upon isolation|40174006|46651001
of the bacteria,|409822003
which
is
recovered|74822006
from the wound|13924000
in only 30%|50607009|420295001
of cases|398241000|413769002
and
can
be
isolated|46651001
from patients|116154003
without tetanus.|76902006

Laboratory identification|261904005|286672002|261904005|7882003
of _C.

tetani_|10629009
can
be
demonstrated
only
by production
of tetanospasmin|418794003
in mice.[3]|447612001|447482001

The "spatula test"|269814003|272393004
is
a clinical test|58147004|269814003|58147004|58147004|272393004
for tetanus|76902006
that
involves|248448006
touching|52962008
the posterior pharyngeal wall|264159006|54066008|255551008|55609009
with a sterile, soft-tipped instrument,|261029002|37378003|233445008|57134006|15296000|37378003|233445008|57134006

is
the involuntary contraction|78558002
of the jaw|661005|181811001
(biting|3404009
down
on the "spatula"
)
,
and
a negative test result|260385009|277775005|260385009|118246004
would
normally
be
a gag reflex attempting to|249488009

in _
The American Journal
of Tropical Medicine|408448007
and
Hygiene_|284779002
states|398070004
that,
in a patient research study,|116154003|110465008|116154003|224699009
the spatula test|269814003|272393004
had
a high specificity|75540009|69658003|371879000|69658003
(zero false-positive test results|258317007|90213003|277775005
)
and
a high sensitivity|75540009|35209006|75540009|365705006|371879000|35209006|371879000|365705006
(94%
of infected patients|116154003
produced
a positive test result|258758003|277775005|258758003|118246004|10828004|277775005|10828004|118246004
).[9]

Unlike many infectious diseases,|191415002
recovery
from naturally acquired tetanus|255396000|76902006
does
not usually
result|394617004
in immunity|58915005
to tetanus.|76902006

This
is
due to the extreme potency|12565001|30207005
of the tetanospasmin toxin|418794003|80917008
;
even
a lethal dose|409644005
of tetanospasmin|418794003
is
insufficient to|71978007|423437008
provoke|410658008
an immune response.|35024006

Tetanus|76902006
can
be
prevented|116699007
by vaccination
with tetanus toxoid.|412375000|58098008

The CDC
recommends
that adults|133936004
receive
a booster vaccine|398827000
every ten years,|23067006|258707000|420258001|258707000
[11]
and
standard care practice
in many places|257557008
is
to
give|419582001
the booster
to any patient|116154003
with a puncture wound|11639007
who
is
uncertain|64957009
of
when
he
or
she
was
last vaccinated,
or
if
he
or
she
has
had
fewer|57176003
than three lifetime doses|421291004|277406006
of the vaccine.|398827000

The booster
may
not
prevent
a potentially fatal case|399166001|398241000
of tetanus|76902006
from the current wound, however,|15240007|13924000
as
it
can
take up|419652001|255532002|419652001|353734004
to two weeks|420797005|258705008
for tetanus antibodies to

In children|410601007|160499008
under the age|424144002
of seven,|420359007
the tetanus vaccine|412375000
is
often|70232002
administered|418283001
as a combined vaccine,|89780004|398827000
DPT/DTaP vaccine,|421245007|125580002
which also
includes|55919000
vaccines|398827000
against diphtheria|397428000
and
pertussis.|27836007

For adults|133936004
and
children over seven,|410601007|21481007|420359007|160499008|21481007|420359007
the Td vaccine|223523003|398827000
(tetanus|76902006
and
diphtheria|397428000
)
or
Tdap
(tetanus,|76902006
diphtheria,|397428000
and
acellular pertussis|27836007
)
is
commonly
used.[10]|394850002

The
WHO
certifies
countries|223369002
as
having
eliminated maternal|72705000
or
neonatal tetanus.|255407002|76902006

Certification
requires
at least two years|276139006|420797005|258707000|263796003|420797005|258707000
of rates
< 1 case|260305007|398241000

In 1998
in Uganda,|223538002
3,433 tetanus cases|260313008|76902006|398241000|260313008|76902006|413769002
were
recorded
in new-born babies|133933007
;
of these,
2,403|260306008
died.|419620001|419099009

After a major public health effort Uganda|255603008|310115006|19487008|223538002
in 2011
was
certified
as
having
eliminated tetanus.[13]|76902006

Mild cases|255604002|398241000|255604002|413769002
of tetanus|76902006
can
be
treated|28995006
with
:

Severe cases|24484000|398241000|24484000|413769002
will
require
admission|32485007
to intensive care.

In addition|260364009
to the measures|246445000|367346004
listed
above|261183002
for mild tetanus|255604002|76902006
:

Drugs|410942007
such as diazepam|387264003
or
other muscle relaxants|74964007
can
be
given|419582001
to
control|31509003
the muscle spasms.|45352006

In extreme cases|12565001|398241000|12565001|413769002
it
may
be
necessary to
paralyze|44695005
the patient|116154003
with curare-|77515003
like drugs|410942007
and
use|277889008|419385000
a mechanical ventilator.|449071006

In order to
survive
a tetanus infection,|76902006
the maintenance
of an airway|43725001|89187006
and
proper nutrition|87276001|384759009
are
required.

An intake
of 3500-4000 calories,|258790008
and
at least 150 g|276139006|258795003|263796003|258795003
of protein|88878007
per day,|258703001|259032004
is
often|70232002
given|419582001
in liquid form|33463005|246176004|264312008|246176004
through a tube directly|83059008
into the stomach|69695003|181246003
(percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy,|235159007
or
through a drip
into a vein|29092000|181367001
(parenteral nutrition.

This high-caloric diet maintenance|75540009|41829006|371879000|41829006
is
required
because of the increased metabolic strain|35105006|48532005|35105006|276768000|260366006|48532005|260366006|276768000
brought|68369002
on
by the increased muscle activity.|88316009

Full recovery|261015003
takes|419652001
4
to 6 weeks|258705008

Tetanus|76902006
is
an international health problem,|263775005|55607006
as
_C.

tetani_ spores|10629009|263883009
are
ubiquitous.

The disease|64572001
occurs|272120004
almost exclusively
in persons|125676002
unvaccinated
or
inadequately
immunized.

Tetanus|76902006
occurs|272120004
worldwide
but
is
more common|242762006|72906007
in hot, damp|264018002|17461003
climates
with soil|415555003
rich|224166006
in organic matter.

This
is
particularly true|31874001
with manure-treated soils,|28995006|415555003
as
the spores|263883009
are
widely
distributed
in the intestines|261093006
and
feces|39477002
of many non-human animals|278412004|387961004
such as horses,|35354009
sheep,|388254009|255392003
cattle,
dogs,|448771007
cats,|448169003|388618001
rats,|371565004|371564000
guinea pigs,|392192009
and
chickens.[3]|409910000|226955001

Spores|263883009
can
be
introduced|127487003
into the body|279495008|123037004
through puncture wounds.|11639007

In agricultural areas,|42798000
a significant number|386134007|410680006|386134007|410681005
of human adults|278412004|133936004
may
harbor|257621007
the organism.|410653004

The spores|263883009
can
also
be
found|404684003
on skin surfaces|119325001|410678000|39937001|410678000|181469002|410678000
and
in contaminated heroin.|62604006|387341002

Heroin users,|387341002
particularly
those
that
inject|422145002
the drug,|410942007
appear
to
be
at high risk|15508007
for tetanus.|76902006

Tetanus ?|76902006
in particular,
the neonatal form ?|255407002|246176004
remains
a significant public health problem|386134007|310115006|55607006
in non-industrialized countries.|223369002

The World Health Organization|263775005|21139007
estimates|414135002
that 59,000 newborns worldwide|133933007
died|419620001|419099009
in 2008
as a result|394617004
of neonatal tetanus.|255407002|76902006

In the United States,|223688001
from 2000
through 2007
an average
of 31 cases|264664006|398241000|264664006|413769002
were
reported|229059009|223458004
per year.|258707000|259039008

Nearly
all
of the cases|398241000|413769002
in the United States|223688001
occur|272120004
in unimmunized individuals|125676002|385435006
or
individuals|125676002|385435006
who
have
allowed
their inoculations
to lapse.[3]

Tetanus|76902006
is
the only vaccine-preventable disease|50607009|398827000|64572001|420295001|398827000|64572001
that
is
infectious
but
is
not contagious.[3]

Tetanus|76902006
was
well known|20572008|36692007
to ancient people|125676002
who
recognized
the relationship|272151006
between wounds|13924000
and
fatal muscle spasms.|399166001|45352006

In 1884,
Arthur Nicolaier
isolated|46651001
the strychnine-|71167000|51200005
like toxin|80917008
of tetanus|76902006
from free-living, anaerobic soil bacteria.|37837009|224130005|59343002|415555003|37837009|419749002|59343002|415555003

The etiology|134198009
of the disease|64572001
was
further|46053002
elucidated
in 1884
by Antonio Carle
and
Giorgio Rattone,
who
demonstrated
the transmissibility
of tetanus|76902006
for the first time.|255216001|410669006|232714002|410669006

They
produced
tetanus|76902006
in rabbits|88818001
by injecting pus|422145002|11311000|422145002|119323008
from a patient|116154003
with fatal tetanus|399166001|76902006
into their sciatic nerves.[3]|41519007

In 1889,
[_C.

tetani_]|10629009
(/wiki/Clostridium_tetani|30917009|58098008
)
was
isolated|46651001
from a human victim|278412004
by Kitasato Shibasabur?,
who later
showed
that
the organism|410653004
could
produce
disease|64572001
when
injected|422145002
into animals,|387961004
and
that
the toxin|80917008
could
be
neutralized
by specific antibodies.|404263002

In 1897,
Edmond Nocard
showed
that tetanus antitoxin|427004002
induced|16404004
passive immunity|112122005
in humans,|278412004
and
could
be
used|394850002
for prophylaxis|169443000
and
treatment.|276239002|416118004

Tetanus toxoid vaccine|412375000|396411005|412375000|398827000|58098008|398827000
was
developed
by P.|20304007

Descombey
in 1924,
and
was
widely
used|394850002
to
prevent
tetanus|76902006
induced|16404004
by battle wounds|13924000
during World War II.[3]
