*Gastroenteritis|25374005
*
*
is
a medical condition|74188005|260905004
characterized
by inflammation|257552002
(_"-itis"_
)
of the gastrointestinal tract|122865005|279972009
that
involves|248448006
both
the stomach|69695003|181246003
(_"gastro"_-|69695003
)
and
the small intestine|264196002|181250005
(_"entero"_-
)
,
resulting|42752001
in some combination|89780004
of diarrhea,|398032003
vomiting|249497008
,
and
abdominal pain|21522001
and
cramping.|55300003|410709000

Gastroenteritis|25374005
has
also
been
referred|439980006
to
as
*
*gastro|69695003
*
*,
*
*stomach bug|69695003|181246003
*
*,
and
*
*stomach virus|407359000
*
*.

Although
unrelated|262241003
to influenza,|6142004|396425006
it
has
also
been
called
*
*stomach flu|12463005
*
*
and
*
*gastric flu|12463005
*
*.

Globally,
most cases|398241000|413769002
in children|410601007|160499008
are
caused|23981006|134198009
by rotavirus.|417542000

In adults,|133936004
norovirus[3]|407359000
and
Campylobacter[4]|35408001
are
more common.|242762006|72906007

Less common causes|276139006|72906007|134198009|263796003|72906007|134198009
include|55919000
other bacteria|74964007|409822003
(
or
their toxins|80917008
)
and
parasites.|37763007

Transmission|258150004
may
occur|272120004
due to consumption
of improperly prepared foods|406205008|255620007
or
contaminated water|102414000
or
via close contact|29179001|11723008|29179001|70862002
with individuals|125676002|385435006
who
are
infectious.

The foundation|418836005
of management|413454004|119270007
is
adequate hydration.|51117008|405006006|88323005|405006006

For mild|255604002
or
moderate cases,|6736007|398241000|6736007|413769002
this
can
typically
be
achieved
via oral rehydration solution.|409585005

For more severe cases,|242762006|24484000|398241000|242762006|24484000|413769002
intravenous fluids|118431008
may
be
needed.|410525008|103325001

Gastroenteritis primarily|25374005
affects|4065008
children|410601007|160499008
and
those
in the developing world.

Gastroenteritis typically|25374005
involves|248448006
both
diarrhea|398032003
and
vomiting,|249497008
[5]|264706000|264605009
or
less commonly,|276139006|263796003
presents|52101004|246105001
with only one|50607009|421379005|420295001|421379005
or
the other.|74964007

Abdominal cramping
may
also
be
present.|52101004|246105001

Signs|72670004
and
symptoms usually
begin|255395001
12?72 hours|259028005|123035007
after contracting|78558002
the infectious agent.|36272005

If
due to a viral agent,|260872001
the condition usually|260905004
resolves
within one week.|421379005|258705008|421379005|259038000

Some viral causes|134198009
may
also
be
associated|47429007
with fever,|386661006
fatigue,|84229001
headache,|25064002
and
muscle pain.|68962001

If
the stool|39477002
is
bloody,|87612001|119273009|32873005
the cause|134198009
is
less likely to|276139006|2931005|263796003|2931005
be
viral[5]
and
more likely to|242762006|2931005
be
bacterial.|409822003

Some bacterial infections|301811001
may
be
associated|47429007
with severe abdominal pain|76948002|277112006|24484000|21522001
and
may
persist
for several weeks.[7]|261028005|258705008

Children|410601007|160499008
infected
with rotavirus usually|417542000
make
a full recovery|261015003
within three|421291004
to eight days.|421825006|258703001

However,
in poor countries treatment|11403006|223369002|276239002|11403006|223369002|416118004|255351007|223369002|276239002|255351007|223369002|416118004
for severe infections|24484000
is
often out of reach|70232002|282679008
and
persistent diarrhea|398032003
is
common.|72906007

Dehydration|34095006
is
a common complication|72906007|116223007|72906007|263718001
of diarrhea,|398032003
[10]
and
a child|410601007|160499008
with a significant degree|386134007|258395000|386134007|246173007
of dehydration|34095006
may
have
a prolonged capillary refill,|255224006|248753002
poor skin turgor,|11403006|26669000|255351007|26669000
and
abnormal breathing.|386813002

Repeat infections|27582007
are
typically
seen
in areas|42798000
with poor sanitation,|11403006|255351007
and
malnutrition,|248325000
[6]
stunted
growth,
and
long-term cognitive delays
can
result.[12]|394617004

Reactive arthritis|129133005
occurs|272120004
in 1%|260305007
of people|125676002
following|255260001
infections
with _Campylobacter_ species,|35408001|116457002
and
Guillain-Barre syndrome|193174005
occurs|272120004
in 0.1%.

Hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS)|111407006
may
occur|272120004
as a result|394617004
of infection
with Shiga toxin-|255835006
producing
_Escherichia coli_|112283007
or
_Shigella_ species,|77352002|116498009
resulting|42752001
in low platelet counts,
poor kidney function,|11403006|11953005|255351007|11953005
and
low red blood cell count|165423001
(
due to their breakdown|40091007|125366008
).

Children|410601007|160499008
are
more
predisposed
to getting HUS
than adults.|133936004

Some viral infections|34014006
may
produce
benign infantile seizures.[1]|30807003|3658006|91175000|30807003|263784005|91175000

Viruses|49872002
(particularly rotavirus|417542000
and
the bacteria _Escherichia coli_|409822003|112283007
and
_Campylobacter_ species|35408001|116457002
are
the primary causes|63161005|134198009|261424001|134198009
of gastroenteritis.|25374005

There
are
,
however,
many other infectious agents|74964007|36272005
that
can
cause|23981006|134198009
this syndrome.

Non-infectious causes|134198009
are
seen
on occasion,|84638005
but
they less likely|276139006|2931005|263796003|2931005
than a viral
or
bacterial etiology.|409822003|134198009

Risk|30207005
of infection
is
higher|75540009|371879000
in children|410601007|160499008
due to their lack|41277001
of immunity|58915005
and
relatively poor hygiene.[1]|11403006|284779002|255351007|284779002

Viruses|49872002
that
are
known|36692007
to
cause|23981006|134198009
gastroenteritis|25374005
include|55919000
rotavirus,|417542000
norovirus,|407359000
adenovirus,|424470006|25225006
and
astrovirus.

Rotavirus|417542000
is
the most common cause|4757001|72906007|134198009
of gastroenteritis|25374005
in children,|410601007|160499008
[14]
and
produces
similar incidence rates
in both
the developed
and
developing world.

Viruses|49872002
cause|23981006|134198009
about 70%
of episodes|272128006
of infectious diarrhea|111939009
in the pediatric age group.|394537008|424144002|261586004|394537008|424144002|160481000|394537008|424144002|389109008

Rotavirus|417542000
is
a less common cause|276139006|72906007|134198009|263796003|72906007|134198009
in adults|133936004
due to acquired immunity.[17]|192360000

Norovirus|407359000
is
the leading cause|236874000|134198009
of gastroenteritis|25374005
among adults|133936004
in America,
causing|23981006
greater|263768009
than 90%|264705001|264703008
of outbreaks.|443684005

These localized epidemics typically|255471002
occur|272120004
when
groups|261586004|160481000
of people|125676002
spend
time|410669006
in close physical proximity|29179001|5880005|29179001|19388002
to each other,
such as
on cruise ships,|225530007|224673002
[5]|264706000|264605009
in hospitals,
or
in restaurants.|257689006

People|125676002
may
remain
infectious even
after their diarrhea|398032003
has
ended.|385656004|422117008

Norovirus|407359000
is
the cause|134198009
of about 10%
of cases|398241000|413769002
in children.[1]|410601007|160499008

In the developed world _Campylobacter jejuni_|66543000
is
the primary cause|63161005|23981006|63161005|134198009|261424001|23981006|261424001|134198009
of bacterial gastroenteritis,|274080003
with half
of these cases|398241000|413769002
associated|47429007
with exposure|71677004|24932003
to poultry.|359839008|28230009

In children,|410601007|160499008
bacteria|409822003
are
the cause|134198009
in about 15%
of cases,|398241000|413769002
with the most common types|4757001|72906007|261664005
being
_Escherichia coli_,|112283007
_Salmonella_,|27268008|302231008
_Shigella_,|36188001|77352002
and
_Campylobacter_ species.|35408001|116457002

If food|255620007
becomes
contaminated|62604006
with bacteria|409822003
and
remains
at room temperature|105723007|246508008
for a period|259037005
of several hours,|261028005|258702006
the bacteria multiply|409822003|421206002
and
increase|260366006
the risk|30207005
of infection
in those
who
consume
the food.|255620007

Some foods commonly|255620007
associated|47429007
with illness|39104002
include|55919000
raw|6304003
or
undercooked meat,|28647000
poultry,|359839008|28230009
seafood,|44027008
and
eggs|102263004
;
raw sprouts|6304003
;
unpasteurized milk|3718001|119321005|70813002
and
soft cheeses|226848002
;
and
fruit|72511004
and
vegetable juices.|129561006

In the developing world,
especially sub-Saharan Africa|409988000
and
Asia,|223500001
cholera|63650001
is
a common cause|72906007|134198009
of gastroenteritis.|25374005

This infection
is
usually
transmitted|60117003|258150004
by contaminated water|102414000
or
food.[19]|255620007

Toxigenic _Clostridium difficile_|262217001|5933001
is
an important cause|134198009
of diarrhea|398032003
that
occurs|272120004
more often|242762006|70232002
in the elderly.|105436006

Infants|418119000
can
carry|288345009
these bacteria|409822003
without developing symptoms.

It
is
a common cause|72906007|134198009
of diarrhea|398032003
in those
who
are
hospitalized|184091000
and
is
frequently|70232002
associated|47429007
with antibiotic use.|255631004|277889008|255631004|419385000

_Staphylococcus aureus_ infectious diarrhea|406602003|398032003
may
also
occur|272120004
in those
who
have
used antibiotics.|394850002|255631004

"Traveler's diarrhea"|11840006
is
usually
a type|261664005
of bacterial gastroenteritis.|274080003

Acid-suppressing medication|34957004|245780008|410942007
appears
to
increase|260366006
the risk|30207005
of significant infection|386134007
after exposure|71677004|24932003
to a number|410680006|410681005
of organisms,|410653004
including|55919000
_Clostridium difficile_,|5933001
_Salmonella_,|27268008|302231008
and
_Campylobacter_ species.|35408001|116457002

The risk|30207005
is
greater|263768009
in those taking proton pump inhibitors|419652001|372525000
than
with H2 antagonists.[22]|58516001

A number|410680006|410681005
of protozoans|417396000
can
cause|23981006|134198009
gastroenteritis ? most commonly _Giardia lamblia_ ?|25374005|78181009
but
_Entamoeba histolytica_|4716008
and
_Cryptosporidium_ species|372395005
have
also
been
implicated.

As a group,|261586004|160481000|389109008
these agents|260872001
comprise
about 10%
of cases|398241000|413769002

_Giardia_|61419001|58265007
occurs|272120004
more commonly|242762006
in the developing world,
but
this etiologic agent|134198009|260872001
causes|134198009
this type|261664005
of illness|39104002
to some degree nearly everywhere.|258395000|246173007

It
occurs|272120004
more commonly|242762006
in persons|125676002
who
have
traveled|420008001
to areas|42798000
with high prevalence,|75540009|371879000
children|410601007|160499008
who
attend|410542002
day care,|258703001|259032004
men|339947000
who
have
sex|258139002|365952006|263495000|70256003|57312000
with men,|339947000
and
following|255260001
disasters.[23]|264657009

Transmission|258150004
may
occur|272120004
via consumption
of contaminated water,|102414000
or
when
people|125676002
share
personal objects.|260787004

In places|257557008
with wet|17461003
and
dry seasons,|13880007|21864008
water quality typically|11713004|263496004|119318008|263496004
worsens|230993007|390772001
during the wet season,|17461003|21864008
and
this correlates
with the time|410669006
of outbreaks.|443684005

In areas|42798000
of the world
with seasons,|21864008
infections
are
more common|242762006|72906007
in the winter.

Bottle-feeding|40043006|228946009|288996002|268472006
of babies|418119000
with improperly sanitized bottles|68276009|419672006

on a global scale.|60132005|19892000|60132005|278111002

Transmission rates|258150004
are
also
related|272151006|262094002
to poor hygiene,|11403006|284779002|255351007|284779002

After
developing tolerance,|228432001|77472006|71412006
adults|133936004
may
carry|288345009
certain organisms|17162000|410653004
without exhibiting signs|72670004
or
symptoms,
and
thus
act
as natural reservoirs|510009|257687008
of contagion.

While
some agents|260872001
(
such as _Shigella_|36188001|77352002
)
only
occur|272120004
in primates,|388073004
others|74964007
may
occur|272120004
in a wide variety|90522003
of animals|387961004
(
such as _Giardia_|61419001|58265007
).[12]

There
are
a number|410680006|410681005
of non-infectious causes|134198009
of inflammation|257552002
of the gastrointestinal tract.|122865005|279972009

Some
of the more common|242762006|72906007
include|55919000
medications|410942007
(
like NSAIDs,|372665008
certain foods|17162000|255620007
such as lactose|423291009
(
in those
who
are
intolerant
)
,
and
gluten|89811004
(
in those with celiac disease.|20401003|396331005|421463005|396331005

Crohn's disease|34000006
is
also
a non-infection source|246083009
of
(often severe|70232002|24484000
)
gastroenteritis.|25374005

Disease|64572001
secondary|2603003|81170007
to toxins|80917008
may
also
occur.|272120004

Some food related conditions|255620007|272151006|260905004|255620007|262094002|260905004
associated|47429007
with nausea,|422587007
vomiting|249497008
,
and
diarrhea|398032003
include|55919000
:
ciguatera|241774007
poisoning|75478009
due to consumption
of contaminated predatory fish,|62604006|90580008
scombroid
associated|47429007
with the consumption
of certain types|17162000|261664005
of spoiled fish,|90580008
tetrodotoxin poisoning|64815002
from the consumption
of puffer fish|286860006
among others,|74964007
and
botulism typically|414531002
due to improperly preserved food.[25]|277405005|255620007

Gastroenteritis|25374005
is
defined
as vomiting|249497008
or
diarrhea|398032003
due to infection
of the small|255507004
or
large bowel.|14742008

The changes|243326001|263703002
in the small bowel|264196002
are
typically noninflammatory,|260391006
while
the ones|421379005
in the large bowel|14742008
are
inflammatory.

The number|410680006|410681005
of pathogens|264418008
required
to
cause|23981006|134198009
an infection
varies
from
as
few
as one|421379005
(
for _Cryptosporidium_|83821001
)
to
as
many
as 108
(
for _Vibrio cholerae_|75953000
).[12]

Gastroenteritis|25374005
is
typically
diagnosed|439401001
clinically,
based|418836005
on a person's signs|125676002|72670004
and
symptoms.

Determining
the exact cause|134198009
is
usually
not
needed|410525008|103325001
as
it
does
not
alter
management|413454004|119270007
of the condition.|260905004

However,
stool cultures|117028002
should
be
performed|398166005
in those with blood|20401003|87612001|20401003|119273009|421463005|87612001|421463005|119273009
in the stool,|39477002
those
who
might
have
been
exposed|24932003
to food poisoning,|75258004
and
those who
have
recently|6493001
traveled|420008001
to the developing world.

Diagnostic testing|439401001|439401001|272393004|261004008|261004008|272393004
may
also
be
done
for surveillance.|225419007

As hypoglycemia|271327008
occurs|272120004
in approximately 10%|26175008
of infants|418119000
and
young children,|84422007|410601007|84422007|160499008
measuring|258104002|263571004
serum glucose|22569008
in this population|385436007|389109008
is
recommended.

Electrolytes|86355000
and
kidney function|11953005
should
also
be
checked|360160009
when
there
is
a concern
about severe dehydration.[16]|24484000|34095006

A determination
of
whether
or
not
the person|125676002
has
dehydration|34095006
is
an important part|260726005
of the assessment,|386053000
with dehydration typically|34095006
divided|422033008
into mild|255604002
(3?5%|260280001
)
,
moderate|6736007
(6?9%|260273003
)
,
and
severe|24484000
(?10%
)
cases.|398241000|413769002

In children,|410601007|160499008
the most accurate signs|4757001|263656005|72670004
of moderate|6736007
or
severe dehydration|24484000|34095006
are
a prolonged capillary refill,|255224006|248753002
poor skin turgor,|11403006|26669000|255351007|26669000
and
abnormal breathing.|386813002

Other useful findings|74964007|404684003|74964007
(
when
used|394850002
in combination|89780004
)
include|55919000
sunken eyes,|246923005
decreased activity,|255385008
a lack|41277001
of tears,|40431001|122594008
and
a dry mouth.|56893005

A normal urinary output|17621005|130953005|258744000|130953005
and
oral fluid intake|251853006
is
reassuring.|223476006

Laboratory testing|269814003
is
of little clinical benefit|58147004
in determining
the degree|258395000|246173007
of dehydration.[1]|34095006

Other potential causes|74964007|30207005|134198009
of signs|72670004
and
symptoms
that
mimic
those
seen
in gastroenteritis|25374005
that
need|410525008|103325001
to
be
ruled|10828004
out
include|55919000
appendicitis,|74400008|85189001
volvulus,|9707006
inflammatory bowel disease,|24526004
urinary tract infections,|68566005
and
diabetes mellitus.|73211009

Pancreatic insufficiency,|37992001|47367009
short bowel syndrome,|26629001
Whipple's disease,|41545003
coeliac disease,|396331005
and
laxative abuse|280982009
should
also
be
considered.

The differential diagnosis|47965005
can
be
complicated|255302009
somewhat
if
the person|125676002
exhibits
_only_ vomiting|50607009|249497008|420295001|249497008
or
diarrhea|398032003
(
rather than
both
).[1]|260305007

Appendicitis|74400008|85189001
may
present|52101004|246105001
with vomiting,|249497008
abdominal pain,|21522001
and
a small amount|255507004|107651007
of diarrhea|398032003
in
up to 33%|264667004
of cases.|398241000|413769002

This
is
in contrast
to the large amount|255509001|107651007
of diarrhea|398032003
that
is
typical
of gastroenteritis.|25374005

Infections
of the lungs|39607008
or
urinary tract|122489005
in children|410601007|160499008
may
also
cause|23981006|134198009
vomiting|249497008
or
diarrhea.|398032003

Classical diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA)|255333006|420422005|260997001|420422005
presents|52101004|246105001
with abdominal pain,|21522001
nausea,|422587007
and
vomiting,|249497008
but
without diarrhea.|398032003

One study|421379005|110465008|421379005|224699009
found|404684003
that 17%
of children|410601007|160499008
with DKA|420422005
were
initially|884001
diagnosed|439401001
as
having
gastroenteritis.[1]|25374005

A supply|425398004
of easily accessible uncontaminated water|36203004|260507000|11713004|36203004|260507000|119318008
and
good sanitation practices|20572008
are
important
for reducing rates|260400001
of infection
and
clinically significant gastroenteritis.|386134007|25374005

Personal measures|246445000|367346004
(
such as
hand washing|258154008
have
been
found|404684003
to
decrease|260400001|260370003
incidence
and
prevalence rates
of gastroenteritis|25374005
in both
the developing
and
developed world
by
as
much
as 30%.

Alcohol-based gels|419442005|385100002|419442005|418836005|385100002|53041004|385100002|53041004|418836005|385100002|430837008|385100002|430837008|418836005|385100002
may
also
be
effective.|255403003|254648000

Breastfeeding|169741004
is
important, especially
in places|257557008
with poor hygiene,|11403006|284779002|255351007|284779002
as is improvement
of hygiene generally.|284779002

Breast milk|226789007
reduces|260400001
both
the frequency|260864003|272123002
of infections
and
their duration.|103335007

Avoiding contaminated food|228034007
or
drink|226465004
should
also
be
effective.[28]|255403003|254648000

Due to
both
its effectiveness|255403003
and
safety,
in 2009
the World Health Organization|263775005|21139007
recommended
that
the rotavirus vaccine|398866008
be
offered|410527000
to all children globally.|410601007|160499008

Two commercial rotavirus vaccines|420797005|398866008
exist
and
several more|261028005
are
in development.|278923009

In Africa|223498002
and
Asia|223500001
these vaccines|398827000
reduced|260400001
severe disease|24484000|64572001
among infants[29]|418119000
and
countries|223369002
that
have
put
in place national immunization programs|257557008|127785005|257557008|421066005|127785005|421066005
have
seen
a decline
in the rates
and
severity|272141005
of disease.|64572001

This vaccine|398827000
may
also
prevent
illness|39104002
in non-vaccinated children|410601007|160499008
by reducing|260400001
the number|410680006|410681005
of circulating infections.|65929005

Since 2000,
the implementation
of a rotavirus vaccination program|415354003
in the United States|223688001
has
substantially
decreased|1250004|260400001|260371004
the number|410680006|410681005
of cases|398241000|413769002
of diarrhea|398032003
by
as
much
as 80 percent.|118582008

The first dose|255216001|277406006|255216001|408102007|232714002|277406006|232714002|408102007
of vaccine|398827000
should
be
given|419582001
to infants|418119000
between 6
and
15 weeks|258705008
of age.|424144002

The oral cholera vaccine|260548002|396422009
has
been
found|404684003
to
be
50?60% effective|255403003|254648000
over 2 years.[36]|260306008|258707000

Gastroenteritis|25374005
is
usually
an acute|272118002
and
self-limiting disease|255469002|64572001
that
does
not
require
medication.|410942007

The preferred treatment|225773000|276239002|225773000|416118004
in those with mild to moderate dehydration|20401003|371923003|34095006|421463005|371923003|34095006
is
oral rehydration therapy (ORT).|243222002

Metoclopramide|372776000
and/or
ondansetron,|372487007
however,
may
be
helpful
in some children,|410601007|160499008
[37]
and
butylscopolamine|395739004
is
useful
in treating abdominal pain.[38]|28995006|21522001|264670000

The primary treatment|63161005|276239002|63161005|416118004|261424001|276239002|261424001|416118004
of gastroenteritis|25374005
in
both
children|410601007|160499008
and
adults|133936004
is
rehydration.|243221009

This
is
preferably
achieved
by oral rehydration therapy,|243222002
although
intravenous delivery|236973005|118215003|255560000|236973005|255560000|118215003
may

is
severe.|24484000

Oral replacement therapy products|260548002|182819002
made
with complex carbohydrates|226374001
(i.e.|42146005|22971001

those
made
from wheat|412071004|6788000|65256004
or

)
may
be
superior|261183002
to those
based|418836005
on simple sugars.|116257004

Drinks|226465004
especially high|75540009|371879000
in simple sugars,|116257004
such as soft drinks|37378003|226465004
and
fruit juices,|129560007
are
not
recommended
in children|410601007|160499008
under 5 years|264706000|258707000|264605009|258707000
of age|424144002
as
they
may
_increase_ diarrhea.|260366006|398032003

Plain water|11713004|119318008
may
be
used|394850002
if
more specific|242762006|69658003
and
effective ORT preparations|255403003|225106003|254648000|225106003
are
unavailable|397854000
or
are
not palatable.

A nasogastric tube|17102003
can
be
used|394850002
in young children|84422007|410601007|84422007|160499008
to administer fluids|418283001|32457005|418283001|33463005
if
warranted.[16]

It
is
recommended
that
breast-fed|169741004
infants|418119000
continue|255238004
to
be
nursed|169741004|106292003|265937000
in the usual fashion,
and
that formula-fed infants|238092004|418119000
continue|255238004
their formula immediately|49499008
after
rehydration|243221009
with ORT.

Lactose-free|423291009|37837009
or
lactose-reduced formulas usually|423291009|260400001
are
not necessary.

Children|410601007|160499008
should
continue|255238004
their usual diet|41829006
during episodes|272128006
of diarrhea|398032003
with the exception
that foods|255620007
high|75540009|371879000
in simple sugars|116257004
should
be
avoided.

The BRAT diet|41829006
(bananas,|256307007
rice,|67324005
applesauce,|420823005
toast
and
tea|16313001
)
is
no longer|255511005

as
it
contains|42504009
insufficient nutrients|71978007|226355009|423437008|226355009
and
has
no benefit
over normal feeding.|17621005|129007004|258744000|129007004

the duration|103335007
of illness|39104002
and
the frequency|260864003|272123002
of stools.|39477002

They
may
also
be
useful
in preventing|116699007
and
treating antibiotic associated diarrhea.|28995006|301469002

Fermented milk products|3718001|119321005|70813002
(
such as yogurt|226863004
are
similarly beneficial.

Zinc supplementation|86739005
appears
to
be
effective|255403003|254648000
in
both
treating|28995006
and
preventing diarrhea|398032003|116699007|398032003
among children|410601007|160499008
in the developing world.[46]

Antiemetic medications|372764000|410942007
may
be
helpful
for treating vomiting|28995006|249497008
in children.|410601007|160499008

Ondansetron|372487007
has
some utility,|225927009
with a single dose|125681006|277406006|125681006|408102007|50607009|277406006|50607009|408102007
being
associated|47429007
with less|276139006|263796003
need|410525008|103325001
for intravenous fluids,|118431008
fewer hospitalizations,|57176003|394656005
and
decreased vomiting.|1250004|249497008|260400001|249497008|260371004|249497008

Metoclopramide|372776000
might
also
be
helpful.

However,
the use|277889008|419385000
of ondansetron|372487007
might
possibly|60022001
be
linked
to an increased rate|35105006|260366006
of return|7528007
to hospital|285201006
in children.|410601007|160499008

The intravenous preparation|225106003|255560000|225106003
of ondansetron|372487007
may
be
given|419582001
orally|260548002
if
clinical judgment warrants.|58147004|61254005

Dimenhydrinate,|387469006
while
reducing vomiting,|260400001|249497008
does
not
appear
to
have
a significant clinical benefit.[1]|386134007|58147004

Antibiotics|255631004
are
not usually
used|394850002
for gastroenteritis,|25374005
although
they
are
sometimes
recommended
if symptoms
are
particularly severe[52]|24484000
or
if
a susceptible bacterial cause|131196009|409822003|134198009
is
isolated|46651001
or
suspected.|415684004

If antibiotics|255631004
are
to
be
employed|224363007
,
a macrolide|105908007|428787002
(
such as azithromycin|387531004
is
preferred|225773000
over a fluoroquinolone
due to higher rates|75540009|371879000
of resistance|30714006
to the latter.

Pseudomembranous colitis,
usually
caused|23981006|134198009
by antibiotic use,|255631004|277889008|255631004|419385000
is
managed|119270007
by discontinuing|410546004|421286000
the causative agent|362944004
and
treating|28995006
it
with
either
metronidazole|372602008
or
vancomycin.|372735009

Bacteria|409822003
and
protozoans|417396000
that
are
amenable
to treatment|276239002|416118004
include|55919000
_Shigella_[55] _Salmonella typhi_,|36188001|264691008|5595000|77352002|264691008|5595000
[56]
and
_Giardia_ species.|372412005

In those with _Giardia_ species|20401003|372412005|421463005|372412005
or
_Entamoeba histolytica_,|4716008
tinidazole treatment|395907001|276239002|395907001|416118004
is
recommended
and
superior|261183002
to metronidazole.|372602008

The World Health Organization (WHO)|263775005|21139007
recommends
the use|277889008|419385000
of antibiotics|255631004
in young children|84422007|410601007|84422007|160499008
who
have
both
bloody diarrhea|95545007
and
fever.[1]|386661006

Antimotility medication|410942007
has
a theoretical risk|30207005
of causing complications,|23981006|116223007
and
although
clinical experience|58147004
has
shown
this to
be
unlikely,
[27]
these drugs|410942007
are
discouraged
in people|125676002
with bloody diarrhea|95545007
or
diarrhea|398032003
that
is
complicated|255302009
by fever.|386661006

Loperamide,|387040009
an opioid analogue,|404642006
is
commonly
used|394850002
for the symptomatic treatment|264931009|276239002|264931009|416118004
of diarrhea.|398032003

Loperamide|387040009
is
not
recommended
in children,|410601007|160499008
however,
as
it
may
cross|65145006
the immature blood?brain barrier|1090009|20245001
and
cause toxicity.|134198009

Bismuth subsalicylate,|409307004
an insoluble complex|103360007
of trivalent bismuth|23172004|64685008
and
salicylate,|255637000|350312004
can
be
used|394850002
in mild to moderate cases,|371923003|398241000|371923003|413769002
[27]
but
salicylate toxicity|7248001
is
theoretically possible.[1]|371930009|60022001

It
is
estimated|414135002
that three to five billion cases|421291004|421820001|398241000|421291004|421820001|413769002
of gastroenteritis|25374005
occur|272120004
globally
on an annual basis,|53281000|53281000|418836005
[60] primarily affecting children|247591002|410601007|247591002|160499008|248448006|410601007|248448006|160499008
and
those
in the developing world.

It
resulted|42752001|394617004
in about 1.3 million deaths|419620001|268923008
in children less|410601007|160499008
than five|421820001
as of 2008,
[61]
with most
of these occurring|272120004
in the world's poorest nations.|11403006|255351007

More
than 450,000
of these fatalities|399166001
are
due to rotavirus|417542000
in children|410601007|160499008
under 5 years|264706000|258707000|264605009|258707000
of age.|424144002

Cholera|63650001
causes|134198009
about three to five million cases|421291004|421820001|398241000|421291004|421820001|413769002
of disease|64572001
and
kills approximately 100,000 people yearly.|248007002|26175008|125676002|53281000

In the developing world children less|410601007|160499008
than two years|420797005|258707000
of age frequently|424144002|70232002
get
six|422218008
or
more infections|242762006
a year|258707000|259039008
that result|394617004
in clinically significant gastroenteritis.|386134007|25374005

It
is
less common|276139006|72906007|263796003|72906007
in adults,|133936004
partly
due to the development|278923009
of acquired immunity.[5]|192360000

In 1980,
gastroenteritis|25374005
from all causes|134198009
caused|23981006|134198009
4.6 million deaths|260308009|419620001|260308009|268923008
in children,|410601007|160499008
with the majority
occurring|272120004
in the developing world.

Death rates|409651001
were
reduced|260400001
significantly
(to approximately 1.5 million deaths annually|26175008|419620001|53281000|26175008|268923008|53281000
)
by the year 2000,|258707000|259039008
largely
due to the introduction|107733003
and
widespread use|85333001|277889008|85333001|419385000
of oral rehydration therapy.|243222002

In the
US,
infections
causing|23981006
gastroenteritis|25374005
are
the second most common infection|264569006|72906007
(
after the common cold,|82272006|54150009
and
they
result|394617004
in
between 200
and
375 million cases|398241000|413769002
of acute diarrhea[5][12]|409966000
and
approximately ten thousand deaths annually,|26175008|23067006|419620001|53281000|26175008|23067006|268923008|53281000|26175008|420258001|419620001|53281000|26175008|420258001|268923008|53281000
[12]
with 150
to 300
of these deaths|419620001|268923008
in children less|410601007|160499008
than five years|421820001|258707000
of age.[1]|424144002

The first usage|255216001|277889008|232714002|277889008
of "gastroenteritis"|25374005
was
in 1825.

Before this time|410669006
it
was
more specifically|242762006
known|36692007
as typhoid fever|4834000
or
"cholera morbus",|63650001
among others,|74964007
or
less specifically|276139006|263796003
as
"griping
of the guts",|122865005
"surfeit",
"flux",
"colic",|73063007
"bowel complaint",|261093006|409586006
or
any one|421379005
of a number|410680006|410681005
of other archaic names|74964007
for acute diarrhea.[66]|409966000

Gastroenteritis|25374005
is
associated|47429007
with many colloquial names,
including|55919000
"Montezuma's revenge",
"Delhi belly",|29823001
"la turista",|11840006
and
"back door sprint",|224749003
among others.|74964007

It
has
played|300776002
a role
in many military campaigns|302314004
and
is
believed to
be
the origin|255395001
of the term "
no guts|122865005
no glory".[12]

Gastroenteritis|25374005
is
the main reason|63161005|410666004
for 3.7 million|260313008
visits
to physicians|309343006
a year|258707000|259039008
in the United States[1]|223688001
and
3 million|260313008
visits
in France.|223666001

In the United States gastroenteritis|223688001|25374005
as a whole|260232004
is
believed to
result|394617004
in costs
of 23 billion USD|264657009
per year[68]|258707000|264697007|259039008|264697007
with that
due to rotavirus|417542000
alone|105529008
resulting|42752001
in estimated costs|414135002
of 1 billion USD|260305007
a year.[1]|258707000|259039008

There
are
a number|410680006|410681005
of vaccines|398827000
against gastroenteritis|25374005
in development.|278923009

For example,
vaccines|398827000
against Shigella|36188001|77352002
and
enterotoxigenic _Escherichia coli_ (ETEC),|116394005
two|420797005
of the leading bacterial causes|236874000|409822003|134198009
of gastroenteritis worldwide.[69][70]|25374005|264698002

Gastroenteritis|25374005
in cats|448169003|388618001
and
dogs|448771007
is
caused|23981006|134198009
by many|260396001
of the same agents|262126009|260872001
as
in humans.|278412004

The most common organisms|4757001|72906007|410653004
are
:
_Campylobacter_,|35408001
_Clostridium difficile_,|5933001
_Clostridium perfringens_,|8331005
and
_Salmonella_.|27268008|302231008

A large number|255509001|410680006|255509001|410681005
of toxic plants|264338008
may
also
cause|23981006|134198009
symptoms.

Some agents|260872001
are
more specific|242762006|69658003
to a certain species.|17162000|69658003

Transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus (TGEV)|25374005|243608008
occurs|272120004
in pigs|106996007|78678003
resulting|42752001
in vomiting,|249497008
diarrhea,|398032003
and
dehydration.|34095006

It
is
believed to
be
introduced|127487003
to pigs|106996007|78678003
by wild bird|33964005
and
there
is
no specific treatment|69658003|276239002|69658003|416118004
available.|103328004

It
is
not transmissible
to humans.[75]|278412004
