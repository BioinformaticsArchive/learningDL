*Trachoma|2576002
*
*
(Greek|1451003
: ???????,
?roughness?
)
is
an infectious disease|191415002
caused|23981006|134198009
by the _Chlamydia trachomatis_ bacterium|63938009|409822003
which
produces
a characteristic roughening
of the inner surface|260521003|410678000
of the eyelids.|80243003

Also
called
*
*granular conjunctivitis|2576002
*
*
and
*
*Egyptian ophthalmia|2576002
*
*,
it
is
the leading cause|236874000|134198009
of infectious blindness
in the world.

Globally,
41 million people|125676002
have
an active infection|55561003
and
nearly 8 million people|125676002
are
visually
impaired|260379002|40226000
as a result|394617004
of this disease.|64572001

It
belongs
to a group|261586004|160481000|389109008
of diseases|64572001
known|36692007
as neglected tropical diseases.|95930005|64572001

The bacterium|409822003
has
an incubation period|406646006
of 5
to 12 days,|258703001
after
which the affected individual|247591002|125676002|247591002|385435006|248448006|125676002|248448006|385435006
experiences
symptoms
of conjunctivitis,|9826008
or
irritation|257553007
similar
to "pink eye."|240066005
Blinding
endemic trachoma|2576002
results|394617004
from multiple episodes|288528003
of reinfection|255230006
that
maintains|385630006
the intense inflammation|103370009|257552002
in the conjunctiva.|29445007|181161008

Without reinfection,|255230006
the inflammation|257552002
will
gradually subside.[2]

The conjunctival inflammation|9826008
is
called ?active trachoma?|55561003|2576002
and
usually
is
seen
in children,|410601007|160499008
especially pre-school children.|161116001|410601007|161116001|160499008|236874000|160498000|272113006|160498000

It
is
characterized
by white lumps|413773004|300848003|185984009|300848003|371251000|300848003
in the undersurface
of the upper eyelid|38934000|244499008
(conjunctival follicles|421242005
or
lymphoid germinal centres|38000004|16733004
)
and
by non-specific inflammation|10003008|257552002
and
thickening often|263899003|70232002
associated|47429007
with papillae.|69070000|78540008

Follicles|24162005|67290009
may
also
appear
at the junction|50974003
of the cornea|28726007|181162001
and
the sclera|18619003|181163006
(limbal follicles|246896009
).

Active trachoma|55561003|2576002
will
often|70232002
be
irritating
and
have
a watery discharge.|263930000|307488001|263930000|58000006

Bacterial secondary infection|301811001|2603003|301811001|81170007
may
occur|272120004
and
cause|23981006|134198009
a purulent discharge.|35013009|307491001

The later structural changes|260383002|243326001|260383002|263703002
of trachoma|2576002
are
referred|439980006
to
as ?cicatricial trachoma?.|76857007|2576002

These
include|55919000
scarring|275322007
in the eyelid|80243003|265782007
(tarsal conjunctiva
)
that
leads|88488004|236874000
to distortion|20967005
of the eyelid|80243003|265782007
with buckling|19352007
of the lid
(tarsus|108371006|264228001
)
so
the lashes
rub
on the eye|81745001|244486005
(trichiasis|60332004
).

These lashes
will
lead|88488004
to corneal opacities|413921009
and
scarring|275322007
and
then
to blindness.

Linear scar present|50009006|70582006|52101004|50009006|70582006|246105001|50009006|275322007|52101004|50009006|275322007|246105001
in the Sulcus subtarsalis
is
called Arlt's line|50009006
(
named|27468005
after Carl Ferdinand
von Arlt.

In addition,|260364009
blood vessels|59820001
and
scar tissue|70582006|275322007
can
invade
the upper cornea|261183002|28726007|261183002|181162001
(pannus|35666006|13485007
).

Resolved limbal follicles|246896009
may
leave|7771000|90737002
small gaps|255507004
in pannus|35666006|13485007
(Herbert?s Pits|79261008
).

Most commonly children|4757001|410601007|4757001|160499008
with active trachoma|55561003|2576002
will
not
present|52101004|246105001
with any symptoms
as the low grade irritation|257553007
and
ocular discharge|81745001|307488001|81745001|58000006|281004000|307488001|281004000|58000006|307488001|58000006
is
just
accepted|385645004
as normal.|17621005|258744000

However,
further symptoms|46053002
may
include|55919000
:

The major complication|255603008|116223007|255603008|263718001
or
the most important one|4757001|421379005
is
corneal ulcer|91514001
occurring|272120004
due to rubbing
by concentrations,|82742001
or
trichiasis|60332004
with superimposed bacterial infection.|301811001

Trachoma|2576002
is
caused|23981006|134198009
by _Chlamydia trachomatis_|63938009
and
it
is
spread|410677005
by direct contact|255589003|11723008|255589003|70862002
with eye,|81745001|244486005
nose,|260540009|181195007
and
throat secretions|54066008|46242002|49928004|46242002|264231000|46242002
from affected individuals,|247591002|125676002|247591002|385435006|248448006|125676002|248448006|385435006
or
contact|11723008|70862002
with fomites
(inanimate
objects|260787004
that
carry|288345009
infectious agents|36272005
)
,
such as towels|54638004
and/or
washcloths,
that
have
had
similar contact|11723008|70862002
with these secretions.|46242002

Flies|367378007
can
also
be
a route|284009009
of mechanical transmission.|261018001|258150004

Untreated|25265005
,
repeated trachoma infections|27582007|2576002
result|394617004
in entropion?|33168009
a painful form|22253000|246176004
of permanent blindness|6934004
when
the eyelids|80243003
turn|282987006
inward,|255460003
causing|23981006
the eyelashes to|85803001
scratch|53181008
the cornea.|28726007|181162001

Children|410601007|160499008
are
the most susceptible|4757001|131196009
to infection
due to their tendency
to easily|36203004
get
dirty,|416705000
but
the blinding effects|253861007|253861007
or
more severe symptoms|242762006|162470006
are
often|70232002
not
felt|285854004
until adulthood.|41847000

Blinding
endemic trachoma|2576002
occurs|272120004
in areas|42798000
with poor personal|11403006|255351007
and
family hygiene.|35359004|284779002

Many factors|260396001
are
indirectly
linked
to the presence|386397008
of trachoma|2576002
including|55919000
lack|41277001
of water,|11713004|119318008
absence|2667000|418560003
of latrines
or
toilets,|360008003
poverty|11403006
in general, flies,|60132005|367378007
close proximity|29179001
to cattle,
crowding|12351004
,
and
so forth.|223528007

However,
the final common pathway|42796001|72906007
seems
to
be
the presence|386397008
of dirty faces|416705000|89545001
in children|410601007|160499008
that
facilitates
the frequent exchange|70232002
of infected ocular discharge|81745001|307488001|81745001|58000006|281004000|307488001|281004000|58000006|307488001|58000006
from one child?s face|421379005|410601007|89545001|421379005|410601007|302549007|421379005|160499008|89545001|421379005|160499008|302549007
to another.

Most transmission|258150004
of trachoma|2576002
occurs|272120004
within the family.[2]|35359004

McCallan
in 1908
divided|422033008
the clinical course|263502005
of trachoma|2576002
into 4 stages|260308009|261612004

The World Health Organization|263775005|21139007
recommends
a simplified grading system|384739005
for trachoma.|2576002

The Simplified
WHO Grading System|384739005
is
summarized
below
:

Trachomatous inflammation,|2576002|257552002
follicular|255285005
(TF
) ? Five|421820001
or
more follicles|242762006|24162005|242762006|67290009
of
>0.5 mm|260316000
on the upper tarsal conjunctiva|261183002

Trachomatous inflammation,|2576002|257552002
intense (TI) ? Papillary hypertrophy|103370009|77526009|56246009
and
inflammatory thickening|263899003
of the upper tarsal conjunctiva obscuring more|261183002
than half
the deep tarsal vessels|131197000|59820001

Trachomatous scarring (TS) - Presence|2576002|386397008|2576002|275322007|386397008
of scarring|275322007
in tarsal conjunctiva.

Trachomatous trichiasis (TT) ?|2576002|60332004
At least one ingrown eyelash|276139006|421379005|301460003|263796003|421379005|301460003
touching|52962008
the globe,|81745001|244486005
or
evidence|18669006
of epilation|1449002
(eyelash removal|398072007
)

Corneal opacity (CO) ? Corneal opacity blurring part|372175005|125149003|246636008|372175005|128305008|246636008|413921009|246636008|260726005
of the pupil margin|392406005|112233002|392406005|82868003|392406005|372249001|35146001|112233002|35146001|82868003|35146001|372249001

Although
trachoma|2576002
was
eliminated
from much|242762006|4757001
of the developed world
in the last century,
this disease|64572001
persists
in many parts|260726005
of the developing world particularly
in communities|133928008
without adequate access|51117008|260507000|88323005|260507000
to water|11713004|119318008
and
sanitation.

Environmental improvement|276339004
:
Modifications|243326001
in water use,|11713004|277889008|11713004|419385000|119318008|277889008|119318008|419385000
fly control,|367378007|31509003|10147004|31509003
latrine use,|277889008|419385000
health education,
and
proximity
to domesticated animals
have
all
been
proposed
to
reduce|260400001
transmission|258150004
of _C.

trachomatis_.

These changes|243326001|263703002
pose
numerous challenges|260396001
for implementation.

It
seems
likely|2931005
that
these environmental changes ultimately impact|276339004|243326001|134293005|276339004|263703002|134293005
on the transmission|258150004
of ocular infection|128351009
by means of lack|41277001
of facial cleanliness.|89545001|103376003

Particular attention|6769007
is
required
for environmental factors|102487004
that
limit|255469002
clean faces.|89545001

Antibiotic therapy|281789004
:
WHO Guidelines
recommend
that
a region|410673009
should
receive
community-based, mass antibiotic treatment|133928008|300848003|255631004|276239002|133928008|300848003|255631004|416118004|133928008|118538004|255631004|276239002|133928008|118538004|255631004|416118004|133928008|418836005|300848003|255631004|276239002|133928008|418836005|300848003|255631004|416118004|133928008|418836005|118538004|255631004|276239002|133928008|418836005|118538004|255631004|416118004
when
the prevalence
of active trachoma|55561003|2576002
among one to nine year-old children|421379005|422113007|258707000|70753007|410601007|421379005|422113007|258707000|70753007|160499008|421379005|422113007|259039008|70753007|410601007|421379005|422113007|259039008|70753007|160499008
is
greater|263768009
than 10 percent.|118582008

Subsequent annual treatment|255260001|53281000|276239002|255260001|53281000|416118004
should
be
administered|418283001
for three years,|421291004|258707000
at which time|410669006
the prevalence
should
be
reassessed.

Annual treatment|53281000|276239002|53281000|416118004
should
continue|255238004
until the prevalence
drops|426684005|404218003
below five percent.|421820001|118582008

At lower prevalences,|261122009
antibiotic treatment|255631004|276239002|255631004|416118004
should
be
family-|35359004
based.|418836005

Antibiotic selection|255631004|50606000
:
Azithromycin|387531004
(single oral dose|125681006|260548002|277406006|125681006|260548002|408102007|50607009|260548002|277406006|50607009|260548002|408102007
of 20 mg/kg
)
or
topical tetracycline|350175003
(one percent eye ointment|421379005|118582008|385123004
twice a day|258703001|259032004
for six weeks|422218008|258705008
).

Azithromycin|387531004
is
preferred|225773000
because
it
is
used|394850002
as a single oral dose.|125681006|260548002|277406006|125681006|260548002|408102007|50607009|260548002|277406006|50607009|260548002|408102007

Although
it
is
expensive,
it
is
generally
used|394850002
as part|260726005
of the international donation program
organized|385650005
by Pfizer
through the International Trachoma Initiative.|2576002|247756008

Azithromycin|387531004
can
be
used|394850002
in children|410601007|160499008
from the age|424144002
of six months|422218008|258706009
and
in pregnancy.[2]|289908002

Surgery|83578000
:
For individuals|125676002|385435006
with trichiasis,|60332004
a bilamellar tarsal rotation procedure|70433009|71388002
is
warranted to
direct|255589003
the lashes away
from the globe.|81745001|244486005

Early intervention|423637002
is
beneficial
as the rate
of recurrence|246455001
is
higher|75540009|371879000
in more advanced disease.[8]|242762006|86005002|64572001

Facial cleanliness|89545001|103376003
:
Children|410601007|160499008
with grossly visible nasal discharge,|24054004
ocular discharge,|81745001|307488001|81745001|58000006|281004000|307488001|281004000|58000006|307488001|58000006
or
flies|367378007
on their faces|89545001
are
at least twice|276139006|421832002|263796003|421832002
as
likely to|2931005
have
active trachoma|55561003|2576002
as children|410601007|160499008
with clean faces.|89545001

Intensive community-based health education|418479003|418479003|418836005
programs
to
promote
face-washing|89545001|302549007
can
significantly
reduce|260400001
the prevalence
of active trachoma,|55561003|2576002
especially intense trachoma|103370009|2576002
(TI
).

If
somebody
is
already
infected
washing
one?s face|89545001|302549007
is
strongly
encouraged
,
especially
a child,|410601007|160499008
in order to
prevent
re-infection.[9]|228877007

National governments
in collaboration
with numerous non-profit organizations|260396001|21139007
implement
trachoma control programs|2576002|31509003
using|260676000
the WHO-recommended SAFE strategy,
which
includes|55919000
:

If
not
treated|28995006
properly
with oral antibiotics,|260548002|255631004
the symptoms
may
escalate
and
cause blindness,|134198009
which
is
the result|394617004
of ulceration|429040005
and
consequent scarring|103332005|103332005|275322007
of the cornea.|28726007|181162001

Surgery|83578000
may
also
be
necessary
to fix eyelid deformities.|102491009|430960001

Without intervention,|225334002
trachoma keeps families|2576002|35359004
shackled
within a cycle|44180009
of poverty,|11403006
as
the disease|64572001
and
its long-term effects|253861007
are
passed
from one generation|421379005
to the next.|18769003|255260001

As of 2002
it
is
believed
that 1.3 million people|260305007|125676002
were
blind
due to trachoma|2576002
with about 40 million|259031006
with a current infection|15240007
of the eyes.|81745001

It
is
common|72906007
in more|242762006
than 50 countries|223369002
world wide.|90522003

In many|260396001
of these communities,|133928008
women|224526002
are
three times more likely|421291004|410669006|2931005|421291004|417929005|2931005
than men to|339947000
be
blinded
by the disease,|64572001
due to their roles
as caretakers|106377002
in the family.[12]|35359004

The disease|64572001
is
one|421379005
of the earliest known eye afflictions,|264499004|36692007|81745001|264499004|36692007|244486005
having
been
identified|7882003
in Egypt|223511009
as early|264499004
as 15 B.C.[2]

Its presence|386397008
was
also
recorded
in ancient China|223581004
and
Mesopotamia.

Trachoma|2576002
became
a problem|55607006
as people|125676002
moved|384598002|370125004
into crowded settlements
or
towns|288521009
where hygiene|284779002
was
poor.|11403006|255351007

It
became
a particular problem|55607006
in Europe|223502009
in the 19th Century.

After the Egyptian Campaign|297308004|1919006
(1798?1802
)
and
the Napoleonic Wars
(1798?1815
)
,
trachoma|2576002
was
rampant
in the army barracks
of Europe|223502009
and
spread|410677005
to those living
in towns|288521009
as troops returned home.|160849004

Stringent control measures|31509003|246445000|31509003|367346004
were
introduced|127487003
and
by the early 20th Century,|264499004
trachoma|2576002
was
essentially
controlled|31509003
in Europe,|223502009
although
cases|398241000|413769002
were
reported|229059009|223458004
up
until
the 1950s.

Today,
most victims
of trachoma|2576002
live|419749002
in underdeveloped
and
poverty-stricken countries|11403006|89098005|223369002|89098005|223369002
in Africa,|223498002
the Middle East,|223605000
and
Asia.|223500001

In the United States,|223688001
the Centers for Disease Control says "|26216008|64572001|31509003|66049007
No national
or
international surveillance [|225419007
for trachoma]|2576002
exists.

Blindness
due to trachoma|2576002
has
been
eliminated
from the United States.|223688001

The last cases|398241000|413769002
were
found|404684003
among Native American populations|413490006|385436007
and
in Appalachia,
and
those
in the boxing,|29506000
wrestling,|5980009
and
sawmill industries
(prolonged exposure|255224006|71677004|255224006|24932003
to combinations|228166004
of sweat|74616000|161857006
and
sawdust often|64601002|70232002
lead|88488004
to the disease|64572001
).

In the late 19th century|260383002
and
early 20th century,|264499004
trachoma|2576002
was
the main reason|63161005|410666004
for an immigrant coming|161158003
through Ellis Island to|288560006
be
deported."[13][14]

In 1913,
President Woodrow Wilson
signed|72670004
an
act
designating funds
for the eradication
of the disease.|64572001

Immigrants|161158003
who
attempted
to
enter|417985001
the U.S.|223688001

through Ellis Island,|288560006
New York|420278009
had
to
be
checked|360160009
for trachoma.|2576002

During this time treatment|410669006|276239002|410669006|416118004
for the disease|64572001
was
by topical application|410618006|359540000|410618006
of copper sulfate.|423960007

By the late 1930s,|260383002
a number|410680006|410681005
of ophthalmologists|422234006
reported|229059009|223458004
success|385669000
in treating trachoma|28995006|2576002
with sulfonamide antibiotics.|387406002|255631004

In 1948,
Vincent Tabone
(
who
was
later to
become
the President
of Malta|223670009
was
entrusted
with the supervision|225313009|119270007
of a campaign
in Malta to|223670009
treat|395077000
trachoma|2576002
using|260676000
sulfonamide tablets|387406002|385055001|387406002|428673006
and
drops.[18]|426684005|404218003

Although
by the 1950s,
trachoma|2576002
had
virtually
disappeared
from the industrialized world,
thanks
to improved sanitation|385425000|3442003
and
overall living conditions,|4683004
it
continues|255238004
to
plague|58750007
the developing world.

Epidemiological studies|110465008|224699009
were
also
conducted|844005
in 1956-63
by the Trachoma Control Pilot Project|2576002|31509003|308040008
in India|223600005
under the Indian Council
for Medical Research.[19]|74188005
This potentially
blinding
disease|64572001
remains
endemic
in the poorest regions|11403006|410673009|255351007|410673009
of Africa,|223498002
Asia,|223500001
and
the Middle East|223605000
and
in some parts|260726005
of Latin America
and
Australia.|223621005

Currently,|15240007
8 million people|125676002
are
visually
impaired|260379002|40226000
as a result|394617004
of trachoma,|2576002
and
41 million
suffer
from active infection.|55561003

Of the 54 countries|223369002
that WHO
cited
as
still
having
blinding trachoma occurring, Australia|2576002|272120004|223621005|2576002|272120004|223621005
is
the only developed country.|50607009|223369002|420295001|223369002

Australian Aboriginal people|125676002
who
live|419749002
in remote communities|5686001|133928008|261007001|133928008
with inadequate sanitation|160707003
are
still
blinded
by this infectious eye disease.[20]|191415002|81745001|191415002|244486005

The International Coalition for Trachoma Control (ICTC)|2576002|31509003
has
produced
a strategic
plan|52713000|397943006
that
lays
out
the actions to|129264002
take|419652001
and
the milestones to
meet|229057006
in order to
achieve
the global elimination|60132005|63911002
of blinding trachoma|2576002|2576002
by the year 2020.|258707000|259039008

The plan|52713000|397943006
is
called 2020 INSight|27026000

?
We
can
make
this disease history,|64572001|64572001|392521001
and
this document|397966007
lays
out
a plan to do so,|52713000|397943006
?
said Dr.|66049007|309343006

Paul Emerson,
chair
of the ICTC
and
director
of The Carter Center?s Trachoma Control Program.|26216008|2576002|31509003

?There
is
an urgent need|103391001|410525008|103391001|103325001
for action to|129264002
avoid
additional suffering|260364009
and
unnecessary blindness
for hundreds
of thousands
of people.?|125676002

The International Trachoma Initiative (ITI)|2576002|247756008
coordinated|162258009
the publication
of 2020 INSight,|27026000
which
was
produced
with input
from a diverse set
of stakeholders.

The Trachoma Atlas|2576002|14806007
is
an open-access resource|56116003|260507000
on the geographical distribution|255464007

About 110 million people|125676002
live|419749002
in endemic areas|42798000
and
need treatment.|410525008|276239002|410525008|416118004|103325001|276239002|103325001|416118004

An additional 210 million|260364009
live|419749002
where trachoma|2576002
is
suspected endemic.|415684004

An estimated 4.6 million people|414135002|125676002
have
an advanced stage|86005002|21191007|86005002|371508000|86005002|261612004
of the disease,|64572001
in which
the eyelashes|85803001
turn|282987006
inward|255460003
and
scrape|56757003|258431006
the cornea,|28726007|181162001
a painful condition|22253000|260905004
called
trichiasis.|60332004

They
face|89545001|302549007
visual impairment|397540003
or
blindness
unless
treated|28995006
with a simple surgery.|13673007|83578000

Trachoma-endemic countries|2576002|223369002
have
established national trachoma control programs|263748003|2576002|31509003|385645004|2576002|31509003
and
are
working|261041009
toward the Global Elimination of Blinding Trachoma by 2020 (GET2020).|60132005|63911002|2576002|60132005|63911002|2576002
