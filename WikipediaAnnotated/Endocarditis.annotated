*Endocarditis|56819008
*
*
is
an inflammation|257552002
of the inner layer|260521003
of the heart,|80891009|302509004
the endocardium.|304059001|119378002

It usually
involves|248448006
the heart valves|17401000
(native|263818007
or
prosthetic valves|11358008
).

Other structures|74964007
that
may
be
involved|248448006
include|55919000
the interventricular septum,|589001
the chordae tendineae,|102298001|279330004
the mural endocardium,|261136004|304059001|261136004|119378002
or
even
on intracardiac devices.|264044002|303607000|264044002|49062001

Endocarditis|56819008
is
characterized
by a prototypic lesion,
the _vegetation_,|264340003
which
is
a mass|300848003|118538004
of platelets,|16378004
fibrin,|113361004
microcolonies
of microorganisms,|264395009
and
scant
in?ammatory cells.|4421005

In the subacute form|19939008|246176004
of infective endocarditis,|301183007|233850007
the vegetation|264340003
may
also
include|55919000
a center|26216008
of granulomatous tissue,|255448004|85756007
which
may
fibrose|263756000
or
calcify.[2]

There
are
multiple ways to|260396001
classify|73504009
endocarditis.|56819008

The simplest classification|13673007|73504009
is
based|418836005
on etiology|134198009
:
either
_infective_
or
_non-infective_,
depending
on
whether
a microorganism|264395009
is
the source|260753009
of the inflammation|257552002
or
not.

Regardless,
the diagnosis|439401001
of endocarditis|56819008
is
based|418836005
on clinical features,|58147004
investigations|386053000
such as an echocardiogram,|40701008
and
blood cultures|30088009
demonstrating
the presence|386397008
of endocarditis-causing microorganisms.|56819008|23981006|264395009

Since
the valves
of the heart|80891009|302509004
do
not
receive
any dedicated blood supply,|87612001|425398004|119273009|425398004
defensive immune mechanisms|224992003|255386009
(
such as white blood cells|767002|52501007
cannot
directly
reach|282679008
the valves
via the bloodstream.

If
an organism|410653004
(
such as bacteria attaches|409822003|102491009
to a valve surface|410678000
and
forms|246176004
a vegetation,|264340003
the host immune response|35024006|255386009|35024006
is
blunted.|428247006

The lack|41277001
of blood supply|87612001|425398004|119273009|425398004
to the valves also
has
implications
on treatment,|276239002|416118004
since
drugs also|410942007
have
difficulty|371157007
reaching|282679008
the infected valve.

Normally,
blood|87612001|119273009
flows
smoothly past
these valves.

If
they
have
been
damaged|37782003
(
from rheumatic fever,|58718002
for example
)
the risk|30207005
of bacteria attachment|409822003|1431002
is
increased.[2]|35105006|260366006

Rheumatic fever|58718002
is
common worldwide|72906007
and
responsible|394851003
for many cases|398241000|413769002
of damaged heart valves.|37782003|17401000

Chronic rheumatic heart disease|87648004
is
characterized
by repeated inflammation|27582007|257552002
with fibrinous resolution.|263753008

The cardinal anatomic|62375001|36298004
changes|243326001|263703002
of the valve
include|55919000
leaflet thickening,|263899003
commissural fusion,|31883006|122501008
and
shortening|129350004
and
thickening|263899003
of the tendinous cords.|13024002

The recurrence|246455001
of rheumatic fever|58718002
is
relatively common|72906007
in the absence|2667000|418560003
of maintenance
of low dose antibiotics,|262459003|255631004
especially
during the first three to five years|255216001|421291004|421820001|258707000|232714002|421291004|421820001|258707000
after the first episode.|255217005

Heart complications|80891009|116223007|302509004|116223007
may
be
long-term
and
severe, particularly|24484000
if
valves
are
involved.|248448006

While
rheumatic fever|58718002
since
the advent
of routine penicillin administration|50811001|373270004|413454004|50811001|373270004|416118004|50811001|413454004|50811001|416118004
for Strep throat|43878008
has
become
less common|276139006|72906007|263796003|72906007
in developed countries,|223369002
in the older generation|70753007
and
in much|242762006|4757001
of the less-developed world,|276139006|263796003
valvular disease|64572001
(
including|55919000
mitral valve prolapse,|409712001
reinfection|255230006
in the form|246176004
of valvular endocarditis,|89736004
and
valve rupture|415747007
)
from undertreated rheumatic fever|58718002
continues|255238004
to
be
a problem.[4]|55607006

In an Indian hospital|285201006
between 2004
and
2005,
4
of 24 endocarditis patients|56819008|116154003
failed
to
demonstrate
classic vegetatations.|255301002|255333006

All
had
rheumatic heart disease (RHD)|194708008
and
presented|246105001
with prolonged fever.|248435007

All
had
severe eccentric mitral regurigitation (MR).|24484000|255380003

(One|421379005
had
severe aortic regurgitation (AR) also.|24484000|60234000
)
One|421379005
had
flail|811004
posterior mitral leaflet (PML).[5]|57793009|244355000

Nonbacterial thrombic endocarditis (NBTE)|56819008
or
marantic endocarditis|57181007
is
most commonly|4757001
found|404684003
on previously undamaged valves.

As
opposed
to infective endocarditis,|301183007|233850007
the vegetations|264340003
in NBTE
are
small, sterile,|255507004|261029002|255507004|15296000
and
tend
to
aggregate|18403000
along the edges|57183005
of the valve
or
the cusps.

Also
unlike infective endocarditis,|301183007|233850007
NBTE
does
not
cause|23981006|134198009
an inflammation response|257552002
from the body.|279495008|123037004

NBTE usually
occurs|272120004
during a hypercoagulable state|76612001
such as system wide bacterial infection,|246333005|90522003|301811001
or
pregnancy,|289908002
though
it
is
also sometimes
seen
in patients|116154003
with venous catheters.|303728004

NBTE
may
also
occur|272120004
in patients|116154003
with cancers,|363346000
particularly mucinous adenocarcinoma[2]|72495009
where Trousseau syndrome
can
be
encountered.

Typically NBTE
does
not
cause|23981006|134198009
many problems|55607006
on its own,
but
parts|260726005
of the vegetations|264340003
may
break
off
and
embolize
to the heart|80891009|302509004
or
brain,|12738006|258335003
or
they
may
serve
as a focus|87017008|363702006
where bacteria|409822003
can
lodge|414418009
,
thus
causing|23981006
infective endocarditis.[2]|301183007|233850007

Another form|246176004
of sterile endocarditis,|261029002|56819008|15296000|56819008
is
termed Libman-Sacks endocarditis|54072008
;
this form|246176004
occurs|272120004
more often|242762006|70232002
in patients|116154003
with lupus erythematosus|200936003
and
is
thought to|88952004
be
due to the deposition|46595003
of immune complexes.|23369004

Like NBTE,
Libman-Sacks endocarditis|54072008
involves|248448006
small vegetations,|255507004|264340003
while
infective endocarditis|301183007|233850007
is
composed
of large vegetations.|255509001|264340003

These immune complexes|23369004
precipitate
an inflammation reaction,|257552002
which
helps
to
differentiate|263933003
it
from NBTE.

Also
unlike NBTE,
Libman-Sacks endocarditis|54072008
does
not
seem
to
have
a preferred location|225773000|246267002
of deposition|46595003
and
may
form|246176004
on the undersurfaces
of the valves
or
even
on the endocardium.[2]|304059001|119378002
