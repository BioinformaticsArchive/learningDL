*Achromatopsia** (**ACHM**),|56852002
is
a medical syndrome|74188005
that
exhibits
symptoms
relating|272151006|262094002
to
at least five separate individual disorders.|276139006|421820001|263869007|125676002|64572001|276139006|421820001|263869007|385435006|64572001|263796003|421820001|263869007|125676002|64572001|263796003|421820001|263869007|385435006|64572001

Although
the term
may
refer|439980006
to acquired disorders|255396000|64572001
such as cerebral achromatopsia also|56852002
known|36692007
as color agnosia,|263714004|42341009
it typically
refers|439980006
to an autosomal recessive congenital color vision disorder,|258211005|66091009|61409007
the inability to
perceive|81742003
color|263714004
and
to
achieve
satisfactory visual acuity|363983007
at high light levels|75540009|56242006|258395000|75540009|371268001|258395000|371879000|56242006|258395000|371879000|371268001|258395000
(typically exterior daylight
).

The syndrome
is
also
present|52101004|246105001
in an incomplete form|255599008|246176004|255609007|246176004
which
is
more properly|242762006
defined
as dyschromatopsia.

The only|50607009|420295001
estimate|414135002
of its relative occurrence|125677006|272120004|29920004|272120004
of 1
:
33,000|264667004
in the general population|60132005|385436007|60132005|389109008
dates|410671006
from the 1960s
or
earlier.|264499004

There
is
some discussion|223482009
as to
whether achromats|56852002
can
see|281004000
color|263714004
or
not.

As
illustrated
in _
The Island|288560006
of the Colorblind_|367469000
by Oliver Sacks,
some achromats|56852002
cannot
see|281004000
color,|263714004
only black, white,|50607009|315240009|413773004|50607009|315240009|185984009|50607009|315240009|371251000|50607009|413464008|413773004|50607009|413464008|185984009|50607009|413464008|371251000|50607009|15086000|413773004|50607009|15086000|185984009|50607009|15086000|371251000|50607009|371252007|413773004|50607009|371252007|185984009|50607009|371252007|371251000|420295001|315240009|413773004|420295001|315240009|185984009|420295001|315240009|371251000|420295001|413464008|413773004|420295001|413464008|185984009|420295001|413464008|371251000|420295001|15086000|413773004|420295001|15086000|185984009|420295001|15086000|371251000|420295001|371252007|413773004|420295001|371252007|185984009|420295001|371252007|371251000
and
shades
of grey.|229029004|371253002

With five different genes currently|421820001|263735002|67271001|15240007
known|36692007
to
cause|23981006|134198009
similar symptoms,
it
may
be
that
some
do
see|281004000
marginal levels|112233002|258395000
of color differentiation|263714004
due to different gene characteristics.|263735002|67271001

With such small sample sizes|255507004|123038009|277049003
and
low response rates,|62482003|371880002
it
is
difficult to accurately|52925006
diagnose|439401001
the 'typical achromatic|56852002
conditions|78326006|260905004
'.

If
the light level|56242006|258395000|56242006|276625007|371268001|258395000|371268001|276625007
during testing|272393004
is
optimized
for them,
they
may
achieve
corrected visual acuity|397536007
of 20/100
to 20/150|419329009
at lower light levels,|261122009|56242006|258395000|261122009|371268001|258395000
regardless of the absence|2667000|418560003
of color.|263714004

One common trait|421379005|72906007
is
hemeralopia|399323001
or
blindness
in full sun.|261015003|49926000

In patients|116154003
with achromatopsia,|56852002
the cone system|67540009|246333005|69059007|246333005
and
fibres|400293002|37202001
carrying|288345009
colour information|263714004
remain
intact.|11163003

This
indicates|410535002
that
the mechanism|257544000
used|394850002
to
construct
colours|263714004
is
defective.

The syndrome
is
frequently|70232002
noticed
first|255216001|232714002
in children|410601007|160499008
around six months|422218008|258706009
of age|424144002
by their photophobic activity|409668002|48761009|409668002|55561003|409668002|258745004|409668002|257733005
and/or
their nystagmus.|563001

The nystagmus|563001
becomes
less noticeable|276139006|263796003
with age|424144002
but
the other symptoms|74964007
of the syndrome
become
more relevant|242762006
as school age approaches.|257698009|424144002|257698009|424144002|103379005

Visual acuity|363983007
and
stability|58158008
of the eye motions generally|31763002
improve|385425000|3442003|385633008
during the first 6?7 years|255216001|258707000|232714002|258707000
of life|224130005
(
but
remain
near 20/200
).

The congenital forms|6160004|246176004|255399007|246176004
of the disorder|64572001
are
considered
stationary|255323003
and
do
not
worsen|230993007|390772001
with age.|424144002

The five symptoms|421820001
associated|47429007
with achromatopsia/dyschromatopsia|56852002
are
:

A sixth symptom|53046009
associated|47429007
with achromatopsia/dychromatopsia|56852002
is
seldom|103356009
reported.|229059009|223458004

Many sufferers|260396001
are
unaware|418107008|406124004
of the three-dimensional aspect|264672008
of their visual system.|49549006|281831001

They frequently|70232002
fail
to
observe
any
of the stereographic features
of a scene._[citation

The syndrome
of achromatopsia/dyschromatopsia|56852002
is
poorly|556001
described
in current medical|15240007|74188005
and
neuro-ophthalmological texts.|394594003

It
became
a common term|72906007
following|255260001
the popular book|278212002
by the neuroscientist Oliver Sacks,
"
The Island|288560006
of the Colorblind,|367469000
"
in 1997.

Up to
that time most color-blind subjects|410669006|367469000
were
described
as achromats|56852002
or
achromatopes.

Those with a lesser degree|20401003|263796003|258395000|20401003|263796003|246173007|421463005|263796003|258395000|421463005|263796003|246173007
of color perception abnormality|263714004|81742003|276654001
were
described
as
either
protanopes,
deuteranopes
or
tetartanopes
(historically tritanopes
).

Achromatopsia|56852002
has
also
been
called
rod monochromacy|102450007
and
total congenital color blindness.|56852002|6160004|56852002|255399007|258755000|232148006|255619001|232148006

Individuals|125676002|385435006
with the congenital form|6160004|246176004|255399007|246176004
of this disorder|64572001
show
complete absence|255594003|2667000|255594003|418560003
of cone cell activity|67540009|48761009|67540009|55561003|67540009|258745004|67540009|257733005
via electroretinography
at high light levels.|75540009|56242006|258395000|75540009|371268001|258395000|371879000|56242006|258395000|371879000|371268001|258395000

There
are
at least four genetic causes|276139006|421534005|3950001|134198009|276139006|421534005|255395001|134198009|263796003|421534005|3950001|134198009|263796003|421534005|255395001|134198009
of congenital ACHM,|6160004|255399007
two|420797005
of which
involve|248448006
cyclic nucleotide-gated ion channels|44180009|71211001|48006008|255592004
(ACHM2/ACHM3
)
,
a third|70905002
involves|248448006
the cone photoreceptor transducin|67540009
(_GNAT2_,
ACHM4
)
,
and
the last remains
unknown.|261665006

Aside from a complete inability to|255594003
see|281004000
color,|263714004
individuals|125676002|385435006
with complete achromatopsia|255594003|56852002
have
a number|410680006|410681005
of other ophthalmologic aberrations.|74964007|394594003|260980007|74964007|239005|260980007

Included|55919000
among these aberrations|260980007
are
greatly
decreased|1250004|260400001|260371004
visual acuity|363983007
(
<0.1
or
20/200
)
in daylight Hemeralopia,|399323001
nystagmus,|563001
and
severe photophobia.|24484000|409668002

The fundus|65784005|414003|87009000|27485007
of the eye|81745001|244486005
appears
completely normal.|17621005|258744000

In general, symptoms|267022002
of incomplete achromatopsia|255599008|56852002|255609007|56852002
are
similar
to those
of complete achromatopsia|255594003|56852002
except
in a diminished form.|1250004|246176004

Individuals|125676002|385435006
with incomplete achromatopsia|255599008|56852002|255609007|56852002
have
reduced visual acuity|13164000
with
or
without nystagmus|563001
or
photophobia.|409668002

Furthermore,
these individuals|125676002|385435006
show
only partial impairment|50607009|255609007|40226000|420295001|255609007|40226000
of cone cell function|67540009|246464006
but
again
have
retained rod cell function.|397909002|17139002|246464006

Acquired achromatopsia/dyschromatopsia|255396000|56852002
is
a condition|260905004
associated|47429007
with damage|37782003
to the diencephalon|87563008|279328001
(primarily
the thalamus|42695009|244433007
of the mid brain|61962009
)
or
the cerebral cortex|40146001
(
the new brain|7147002|12738006|7147002|258335003
).

Thalamic achromatopsia/dyschromatopsia|42695009|56852002
is
caused|23981006|134198009
by damage|37782003
to the thalamus|42695009|244433007
;
it
is
most frequently|4757001|70232002
caused|23981006|134198009
by tumor growth|108369006
since
the thalamus|42695009|244433007
is
well|20572008
protected
from external damage.|261074009|37782003

Cerebral achromatopsia|56852002
is
a form|246176004
of acquired color blindness|71676008
that
is
caused|23981006|134198009
by damage|37782003
to the cerebral cortex|40146001
of the brain,|12738006|258335003
rather than
abnormalities|276654001
in the cells|4421005
of the eye's retina.|113323002

It
is
most frequently|4757001|70232002
caused|23981006|134198009
by physical trauma,|5880005|5880005|19388002|19388002
hemorrhage|131148009
or
tumor tissue growth.|258435002

The known causes|36692007|134198009
of the congenital forms|6160004|246176004|255399007|246176004
of achromatopsia|56852002
are
all
due to malfunction|76797004|386585008
of the retinal phototransduction pathway.|5665001|103067001

Specifically,
this form|246176004
of ACHM
seems
to
result|394617004
from the inability
of cone cells|67540009
to properly
respond
to light input|56242006|371268001
by hyperpolarizing.

Known genetic causes|36692007|3950001|134198009|36692007|255395001|134198009
of this
are
mutations|55446002
in the cone cell cyclic nucleotide-gated ion|67540009|44180009|71211001|48006008
channels|255592004
_CNGA3_
(ACHM2
)
and
_CNGB3_
(ACHM3
)
as well as
the cone cell transducin,|67540009
_GNAT2_
(ACHM4
).

A fourth genetic cause|29970001|3950001|134198009|29970001|255395001|134198009
(ACHM5,
OMIM 613093
)
has
been
discovered
in 2009.

It
is
a mutation|55446002
of gene PDE6C,|67271001
located
on chromosome locus 10,|56332006
10q24.

It
is
estimated|414135002
than less|276139006|263796003
than 2%|260306008
of achromatopsias|56852002
are
caused|23981006|134198009
by a mutation|55446002
in this gene.|67271001

The hemeralopic aspect|399323001
of ACHM
can
be
diagnosed|439401001
non-invasively
using|260676000
electroretinography.

The response
at low|62482003|371880002
(scotopic
)
and
median|399488007|260528009
(mesotopic
)
light levels|56242006|258395000|371268001|258395000
will
be
normal|17621005|258744000
but
the response
under high light level|75540009|56242006|258395000|75540009|56242006|276625007|75540009|371268001|258395000|75540009|371268001|276625007|371879000|56242006|258395000|371879000|56242006|276625007|371879000|371268001|258395000|371879000|371268001|276625007
(photopic|61409007
)
conditions|260905004
will
be
absent.|2667000

The mesotopic level|258395000|276625007
is
approximately 100 times|26175008|410669006|26175008|417929005
lower|261122009
than the clinical level|58147004|258395000|58147004|276625007
used|394850002
for the typical high level electroretinogram.|75540009|258395000|75540009|276625007|371879000|258395000|371879000|276625007

When
as
described,
the condition|260905004
is
due to a saturation|103401005
in the neural portion|3057000|260726005|256864008|260726005
of the retina|5665001|181171005
and
not
due to the absence|2667000|418560003
of the photoreceptors
per se.

In general,|60132005
the molecular pathomechanism|290005005
of ACHM
is
either
the inability
to properly
control|31509003
or
respond
to altered levels|258395000
of cGMP.|42204005

cGMP|42204005
is
particularly important
in visual perception|281004000|311886005
as its level|258395000|276625007
controls|54776003|31509003
the opening|56116003
of cyclic nucleotide-gated ion channels (CNGs).|44180009|71211001|48006008|255592004

Decreasing|260371004
the concentration|82742001
of cGMP|42204005
results|394617004
in closure|112695004
of CNGs
and
resulting hyperpolarization|42752001
and
cessation
of glutamate release.|430503006|58000006|430503006|68776005|430503006|258760001|430503006|129299003|430503006|115956009|104697004|58000006|104697004|68776005|104697004|258760001|104697004|129299003|104697004|115956009

Native retinal CNGs|263818007|5665001|263818007|103067001
are
composed
of 2 ?-|260306008
and
2 ?-subunits,|260306008
which
are
_CNGA3_
and
_CNGB3_,
respectively,
in cone cells.|67540009

When
expressed alone, _CNGB3_|105529008
cannot
produce
functional channels,|40143009|255592004|246464006|255592004
whereas
this
is
not
the case|398241000
for _CNGA3_.

Coassembly
of _CNGA3_
and
_CNGB3_
produces
channels|255592004
with altered membrane expression,|83097008|10012005
ion permeability|48006008|82540007
(Na+|385432009
vs.

K+
and
Ca2+,
relative efficacy|125677006|29920004
of cAMP/cGMP activation,|42204005
decreased|1250004|260400001|260371004
outward rectification,|255543005
current flickering,|15240007|56170001
and
sensitivity to|83185005
block|26036001|112232007
by L-cis-diltiazem.|258995007|372793000|420559008|372793000

Mutations|55446002
tend
to
result|394617004
in the loss
of _CNGB3_ function|246464006
or
gain
of function|246464006
(often increased affinity|70232002|35105006|70232002|260366006
for cGMP|42204005
)
of _CNGA3_.

cGMP levels|42204005|258395000
are
controlled|31509003
by the activity|48761009|55561003|258745004|257733005
of the cone cell transducin,|67540009
_GNAT2_.

Mutations|55446002
in _GNAT2_
tend
to
result|394617004
in a truncated
and
,
presumably,
non-functional protein,|42044006|88878007
thereby
preventing|116699007
alteration
of cGMP levels|42204005|258395000
by photons.|290006006

There
is
a positive correlation|258758003|10828004
between the severity|272141005
of mutations|55446002
in these proteins|88878007
and
the completeness|272143008
of the achromatopsia phenotype.|56852002|8116006|56852002|363778006

While
some mutations|55446002
in _CNGA3_ result|394617004
in truncated
and
,
presumably,
non-functional channels|42044006|255592004
this
is
largely
not
the case.|398241000

While
few mutations|57176003|55446002
have
received
in-depth study,|131197000|110465008|131197000|224699009
see|281004000
table 1,|86407004
at least one mutation|276139006|421379005|55446002|263796003|421379005|55446002
does
result|394617004
in functional channels.|40143009|255592004|246464006|255592004

Curiously,
this mutation,|55446002
T369S,
produces
profound alterations
when
expressed
without CNGB3.

One|421379005
such alteration
is
decreased affinity|1250004|260400001|260371004
for Cyclic guanosine monophosphate.|42204005

Others|74964007
include|55919000
the introduction|107733003
of a sub-conductance,|261089000|118555000
altered
single-channel gating kinetics,|125681006|255592004|50607009|255592004
and
increased calcium permeability.|35105006|5540006|82540007|260366006|5540006|82540007

When
mutant T369S
channels|255592004
coassemble
with CNGB3,
however,
the only|50607009|420295001
remaining
aberration|260980007
is
increased calcium permeability.|35105006|5540006|82540007|260366006|5540006|82540007

While
it
is
not immediately|49499008
clear|263707001
how
this increase|260366006
in Ca2+
leads|88488004|236874000
to ACHM,
one hypothesis|421379005
is
that
this increased current|35105006|15240007|260366006|15240007
decreases|260370003
the signal-to-noise ratio.|38952000|118586006

Other characterized mutations,|74964007|55446002
such as Y181C
and
the other S1 region mutations,|74964007|410673009|55446002
result|394617004
in decreased current density|125150003|15240007
due to an inability
of the channel|255592004
to traffic
to the surface.|410678000

Such loss
of function|246464006
will
undoubtedly
negate
the cone cell's ability to|67540009|371150009
respond
to visual input|255374006
and
produce
achromatopsia.|56852002

At least one other missense mutation|276139006|421379005|55446002|263796003|421379005|55446002
outside of the S1 region,|410673009
T224R,
also
leads|88488004|236874000
to loss
of function.[2]|246464006

While
very few mutations|260358002|55446002
in CNGB3
have
been
characterized
,
the vast majority
of them
result|394617004
in truncated channels|255592004
that
are
presumably non-functional, table 2.|42044006|86407004

This
will
largely
result|394617004
in haploinsufficiency,
though
in some cases|398241000|413769002
the truncated proteins|88878007
may
be
able|371150009
to coassemble
with wild-type|262290003|261664005
channels|255592004
in a dominant negative fashion.|260385009

The most prevalent ACHM3 mutation,|4757001|55446002
T383IfsX12,
results|394617004
in a non-functional truncated protein|42044006|88878007
that
does
not properly traffic
to the cell membrane.|53982002

The three missense mutations|421291004|55446002
that
have
received
further|46053002
study|110465008|224699009
show
a number|410680006|410681005
of aberrant properties,|260980007|370130000|260980007|116685008
with one underlying theme.|421379005

The R403Q mutation,|55446002
which
lies|40199007|255576009
in the pore region|410673009
of the channel,|255592004
results|394617004
in an increase|260366006
in outward current rectification,|255543005|15240007
versus
the largely linear current-voltage relationship|50009006|15240007|272151006
of wild-type channels,|262290003|261664005|255592004
concomitant|79970003
with an increase|260366006
in cGMP affinity.|42204005

The other mutations|74964007|55446002
show
either
increased|35105006|260366006
(S435F
)
or
decreased|1250004|260400001|260371004
(F525N
)
surface expression|410678000|10012005
but
also
with increased affinity|35105006|260366006
for cAMP
and
cGMP.|42204005

It
is
the increased affinity|35105006|260366006
for cGMP|42204005
and
cAMP
in these mutants
that
is
likely|2931005
the disorder-causing change.|64572001|23981006|243326001|64572001|23981006|263703002

Such increased affinity|35105006|260366006
will
result|394617004
in channels|255592004
that
are
insensitive
to the slight concentration|255510006|82742001|255604002|82742001
changes|243326001|263703002
of cGMP|42204005
due to light input|56242006|371268001
into the retina.|5665001|181171005

Upon activation
by light,|56242006|371268001
rhodopsin|57649002
causes|134198009
the exchange
of GDP|57858007
for GTP|91262008
in the guanine nucleotide binding protein|22185007
(G-protein ?-transducing activity polypeptide 2|22185007|48761009|70354003|22185007|55561003|70354003|22185007|258745004|70354003|22185007|257733005|70354003
(_GNAT2_
).

This
causes|134198009
the release|58000006|68776005|258760001|129299003|115956009
of the activated ?-subunit
from the inhibitory ?/?-subunits.|61511001

This ?-subunit then
activates
a phosphodiesterase|130108009
that
catalyzes
the conversion|272148004
of cGMP|42204005
to GMP,|15943003
thereby
reducing|260400001
current|15240007
through CNG3 channels.|255592004

As this process|415178003
is
absolutely vital|260410005
for proper color processing|263714004
it
is
not
surprising
that mutations|55446002
in _GNAT2_ lead|88488004
to achromatopsia.|56852002

The known mutations|36692007|55446002
in this gene,|67271001
table 3,|86407004
all result|394617004
in truncated proteins.|88878007

Presumably,
then,
these proteins|88878007
are
non-functional|42044006
and
,
consequently,
rhodopsin|57649002
that
has
been
activated
by light|56242006|371268001
does
not
lead|88488004
to altered cGMP levels|42204005|258395000
or
photoreceptor membrane hyperpolarization.|83097008

There
is
generally
no treatment to|276239002|416118004
cure
achromatopsia.|56852002

However,
since
2003,
there
is
a cybernetic device|303607000|49062001
called
eyeborg
that
allows
people to|125676002
perceive|81742003
colour|263714004
through sound waves.

Achromatopsic artist Neil Harbisson|56852002|159062006
was
the first to|255216001|232714002
use|277889008|419385000
such a device|303607000|49062001
in early 2004,|264499004
the eyeborg
allowed
him
start|255395001
painting|36864000
in color|263714004
by memorizing
the sound|68325009
of each colour.[15]|263714004

Moreover,
there
is
some research
on gene therapy|394613000
for animals|387961004
with achromatopsia,|56852002
with positive results|258758003|394617004|10828004|394617004
on mice|447612001|447482001
and
young dogs,|84422007|448771007|84422007
but
less effectiveness|276139006|255403003|263796003|255403003
on older dogs.|70753007|448771007|70753007

However,
no experiments
have
been
made
on humans.|278412004

There
are
many challenges|260396001
to conducting gene therapy|844005|394613000
on humans.|278412004

See|281004000

about
it.

Achromatopsia|56852002
is
a relatively uncommon disorder,|103356009|64572001
with a prevalence
of 1
in 30,000 people|125676002
(0.0033%
).

However,
in the small Micronesian atoll|255507004|3698008
of Pingelap approximately 5%|26175008
of the atoll's 3000 inhabitants
are
afflicted.[17][18]

In approximately 1775 Typhoon Lengkieki struck|26175008|89098005
and
devastated
the Micronesian atoll|3698008
of Pingelap.

The typhoon
and
ensuing famine
left|7771000
only
around 20 survivors,
one|421379005
of whom
was
heterozygous|14556007
for achromatopsia.|56852002

Four generations|421534005
after this population|385436007|389109008
bottleneck
the prevalence
of achromatopsia|56852002
is
5%|264706000|264605009
with a further 30%|46053002
as carriers.|47461006

The people|125676002
of this region|410673009
have
termed achromatopsia "maskun",|56852002
which literally means "|255586005
not
see|281004000
"
in Pingelapese.

This unusual population drew neurologist Oliver Sacks|385436007|56397003|389109008|56397003
to the island|288560006
for which
he
wrote|12261009
his 1997 book,|278212002

of the Colour-blind_.|367469000
