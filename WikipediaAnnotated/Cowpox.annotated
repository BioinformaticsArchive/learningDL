*
*Cowpox|70090004
*
*
is
a skin disease|95320005
caused|23981006|134198009
by a virus|49872002
known|36692007
as the _
*
*Cowpox virus|37362000
*
*_.

The pox
is
related|272151006|262094002
to the _vaccinia_ virus|13126002
and
got
its name
from the distribution|255464007
of the disease|64572001
when
dairymaids
touched|386476006|52962008|397624008
the udders|27528008
of infected cows.|34618005

The ailment|39104002
manifests|250255003
itself
in the form|246176004
of red blisters|386713009|408764000|386713009|247464001|371240000|408764000|371240000|247464001
and
is
transmitted|60117003|258150004
by touch|386476006|52962008|397624008
from infected animals|387961004
to humans.|278412004

Cowpox|70090004
is
similar
to
but
much milder|255604002
than the highly contagious|75540009
and
sometimes deadly smallpox disease.|67924001

It
resembles
mild smallpox,|255604002|67924001|255604002|243568000
and
was
the basis|418836005
of the first smallpox vaccines.|255216001|396439006|232714002|396439006

When
the patient recovers|116154003|74822006
from cowpox,|70090004
the person|125676002
is
immune|255386009
to smallpox.|67924001|243568000

The cowpox virus|37362000
was
used|394850002
to
perform|398166005
the first|255216001|232714002
(
by Western physicians|309343006
that
is.

Prior to this,
traditional female healers|263901007|248152002|263901007|224526002
in Turkey,|278900006|20657003
along
with those in Africa|52101004|223498002|18720000|223498002
and
a number|410680006|410681005
of African Americans|15086000
practiced
the use|277889008|419385000
of pus|11311000|119323008
from healed smallpox pustules to|90910008|67924001|271760008|90910008|243568000|271760008
induce|16404004
immunization|127785005
)
successful vaccination|385669000
against a disease,|64572001
smallpox,|67924001|243568000
which
is
caused|23981006|134198009
by the related _Variola virus_.|272151006|243568000|262094002|243568000

Therefore,
the word "vaccination" ? first|255373000|255216001|255373000|232714002
used|394850002
by Edward Jenner
(
an English physician|297487008|309343006|25804004|309343006
)
in 1796 ?[2]
has
the Latin root _vaccinus_ meaning|85077000|2338009
of
or
from cows.|34618005

World Health Organization|263775005|21139007
in 1980
announced
that smallpox|67924001|243568000
was
the first disease|255216001|64572001|232714002|64572001
that
had
been
eradicated
world wide|90522003
by a program
of vaccination.

Despite the eradication
of smallpox|67924001|243568000
in the past century,|410513005
other orthopoxviruses,|74964007|29724001
such as monkeypox virus,|59774002
vaccinia virus|13126002
in Brazil,|223715002
and
cowpox virus (CPXV)|37362000
in Europe,|223502009
still
infect
humans.|278412004

CPXV
has
been
restricted|263856008
to the Old World|70753007
with wild rodents|262290003|388077003
as its natural reservoir.|510009|257687008

Human CPXV infections|278412004
are
commonly
described
in relation to
contact|11723008|70862002
with diseased domestic cats,|64572001|448169003
sometimes directly
from rats|371565004|371564000
or
domesticated house mice.|447612001

Human infections usually|278412004
remain
localized|255471002
and
self-limiting|255469002
but
can
become
fatal|399166001
in immunosuppressed patients.|370391006

In the years 1770|258707000
till
1790
at least six people|276139006|422218008|125676002|263796003|422218008|125676002
who
had
contact|11723008|70862002
with a cow|34618005
had
tested|272393004
independently
the possibility
of
using|260676000
the cowpox vaccine|70090004
as an immunization|127785005
for smallpox|67924001|243568000
in humans|278412004
for the first time|255216001|410669006|232714002|410669006
;
among them
the English farmer Benjamin Jesty,|297487008|106388008|261702002|25804004|106388008|261702002
in Dorset,|223875002
in 1774
and
the German teacher Peter Plett|7695005|106304008
in 1791.

Jesty
inoculated
his wife|127850001
and
two young sons|420797005|84422007|65616008
and
thus
spared
them probable death|2931005|419620001|2931005|268923008
by smallpox|67924001|243568000
which
was
raging
in the area|42798000
in which
they
lived.|224130005|419749002

His patients|116154003
who
had
contracted|78558002
and
recovered|74822006
from the similar
but
milder cowpox|255604002|70090004
(mainly milkmaids
)
,
seemed
to
be
immune|255386009
not only
to further cases|46053002|398241000|46053002|413769002
of cowpox,|70090004
but
also
to smallpox.|67924001|243568000

By scratching|40590001|53181008
the fluid|32457005|33463005|255765007
from cowpox|70090004
lesions
into the skin|119325001|39937001|181469002
of healthy individuals,|263775005|125676002|263775005|385435006
he
was
able to|371150009
immunize
those people|125676002
against smallpox.|67924001|243568000

It
was
reported|229059009|223458004
that farmers|106388008
and
people|125676002
working|261041009
regularly
with cows|34618005
and
horses|35354009
were
often|70232002
spared
during smallpox outbreaks.|67924001|443684005|243568000|443684005

More
and
more
an investigation|386053000
conducted|844005
towards 1790
by the British Army
showed
that horse-mounted troops|35354009|246143003|388441000|246143003|388445009|246143003
were
less
infected
by smallpox|67924001|243568000
than infantry,
and
this
due to a major exposure|255603008|71677004|255603008|24932003
to the similar _horse pox_ virus|35354009|424976006|388441000|424976006|388445009|424976006
(_Variola equina_|67924001|4639008
).

By the early 19th century,|264499004
more
than 100,000 persons|125676002
in Great Britain|223861009
had
been
vaccinated.

The arm-to-arm method|40983000|260686004|40983000|272394005|53120007|260686004|53120007|272394005|182245002|260686004|182245002|272394005|302538001|260686004|302538001|272394005
was
also
used|394850002
to
distribute
Jenner's vaccine|398827000
throughout the Spanish Empire.

Spanish king Charles IV's daughter|66089001
had
been
stricken|89098005
with smallpox|67924001|243568000
in 1798,
and
after
she
recovered|74822006
,
he
arranged
for the rest|258157001
of his family to|35359004
be
vaccinated.

In 1803,
the king,
convinced
of the benefits
of the vaccine,|398827000
ordered
his personal physician Francis Xavier|309343006
de Balmis,
to
deliver
it
to the Spanish dominions
in North
and
South America.|223504005

To
maintain|385630006
the vaccine|398827000
in an available state|103328004|398070004
during the voyage,
the physician|309343006
recruited
from the orphanages|74056004
of Spain twenty-two young boys,|223680008|420797005|84422007|433152004
age three to nine years,|424144002|421291004|422113007|258707000
who
have
never
had
cowpox|70090004
or
smallpox before.|67924001|243568000

During the trip|75941004
across the Atlantic,
de Balmis
vaccinated
the orphans|373929005
in a living chain.|46666003

Two children|420797005|410601007|420797005|160499008
were
vaccinated
immediately|49499008
before
departure,
and
when
cowpox pustules|70090004|271760008
had
appeared
on their arms,|40983000
material|260769002
from these lesions
was
used|394850002
to
vaccinate
two more children.[6]|420797005|410601007|420797005|160499008

Jesty
did
not
publicise
his findings,|404684003
however,
credit
was
assumed
by Jenner
who
performed|398166005
his first inoculation,|255216001|232714002
twenty-two years later|420797005|258707000
and
publicised
his findings.|404684003

It
is
said|66049007
that Jenner
made
this discovery
by himself possibly|60022001
without knowing previous accounts twenty years earlier.|36692007|9130008|258707000|264499004

Although
Jesty
could
have
been
the first to discover|255216001|232714002
it,
Jenner let
everyone
know|36692007
and
understand|66216009
it,
thus
taking|419652001
credit
for it.

The virus|49872002
is
found|404684003
in Europe,|223502009
and
mainly
in the UK.

Human cases today|278412004|398241000|278412004|413769002
are
very rare|260358002|84638005|260358002|103356009
and
most often|4757001|70232002
contracted|78558002
from domestic cats.|448169003

The virus|49872002
is
not commonly
found|404684003
in cows|34618005
;
the reservoir hosts|257687008
for the virus|49872002
are
woodland rodents,|388077003
particularly voles.|384655006

It
is
from these rodents|388077003
that domestic cats|448169003
contract|78558002
the virus.|49872002

Symptoms
in cats|448169003|388618001
include|55919000
lesions
on the face,|89545001|302549007
neck,|45048000|302550007
forelimbs,|116012003
and
paws,|95936004
and
less commonly upper respiratory tract infection.|276139006|54150009|263796003|54150009

Symptoms
of infection
with cowpox virus|37362000
in humans|278412004
are
localized|255471002
,
pustular lesions generally|48055004
found|404684003
on the hands|85562004
and
limited|255469002
to the site|10546003
of introduction.|107733003

The incubation period|406646006
is
nine to|422113007
ten|23067006|420258001
days.|258703001

The virus|49872002
is
prevalent
in late summer|260383002
and
autumn.

Kinepox
is
an alternate term|49572008
for the smallpox vaccine|396439006
used|394850002
in early 19th century America.|264499004

Popularized
by Jenner
in the late 1790s,|260383002
kinepox
was
a far safer method|46053002|260686004|46053002|272394005
for inoculating people|125676002
against smallpox|67924001|243568000
than the previous method,|9130008|260686004|9130008|272394005
variolation,
which
had
a 3% fatality rate.|260313008|399166001

In a famous letter|126202002
to Meriwether Lewis
in 1803,
Thomas Jefferson
instructed
the Lewis
and
Clark expedition
to "
carry|288345009
with you
some matter
of the kine-pox
;
inform|410938009|223458004
those
of them
with whom
you
may
be
,
of its efficacy
as a preservative|418403001
from the smallpox|67924001|243568000
; &
encourage
them
in the use|277889008|419385000
of it..."[8] Jefferson
had
developed
an interest|225469004
in protecting Native Americans|413490006
from smallpox|67924001|243568000
having
been
aware|312012004
of epidemics
along the Missouri River|224070000|420531007
during the previous century.|9130008

One year|421379005|258707000|421379005|259039008
prior to his special instructions|67995009|409073007
to Lewis,
Jefferson
had
persuaded
a visiting delegation|386254000
of North American Indian Chieftains to|413491005
be
vaccinated
with kinepox
during the winter
of 1801-2.

Unfortunately,
Lewis never
got
the opportunity to
use|277889008|419385000
kinepox
during the pair's expedition
as
it
had
become
inadvertently inactive ?|73425007
a common occurrence|72906007|272120004
in a time|410669006
before vaccines|398827000
were
stabilized|409051000
with preservatives|418403001
like glycerol|80582002
or
kept
at refrigeration temperatures.|246508008

Cowpox|70090004
was
the original vaccine|19535007|398827000
of sorts
for smallpox.|67924001|243568000

After infection
with the disease,|64572001
the body|279495008|123037004
(usually
)
gains|35105006|255396000|260366006|260369004|398092000
the ability|371150009
of recognizing
the similar smallpox virus|243568000
from its antigens|7120007
and
so|223528007
is
able to|371150009
fight|248005005
the smallpox disease much more efficiently.|67924001

The vaccinia virus now|13126002
used|394850002
for smallpox vaccination|40001004
is
sufficiently different|263735002
from the cowpox virus|37362000
found|404684003
in the wild|262290003
as to
be
considered
a separate virus.|263869007|49872002|263869007

The virus|49872002
contains|42504009
one|421379005
hundred
and
eighty-six thousand base pairs|422218008
of DNA,|24851008
which
contains|42504009
the information
for about one|421379005
hundred
and
eighty-seven genes.|420359007|67271001

This
makes
cowpox one|70090004|421379005
of the most complicated viruses|4757001|255302009|49872002
known.|36692007

Some one|421379005
hundred
of these genes|67271001
give|419582001
instructions|409073007
for key parts|260726005
of the human immune system,|278412004|116003000
giving|419582001
a clue
as to
why
the closely related smallpox|272151006|67924001|272151006|243568000|262094002|67924001|262094002|243568000
is
so lethal.[10]|223528007

As cowpox virus|37362000
was
tested|272393004
to
invent
a smallpox vaccine,|396439006
prevention|169443000
against cowpox|70090004
is
by vaccination
against smallpox.|67924001|243568000
