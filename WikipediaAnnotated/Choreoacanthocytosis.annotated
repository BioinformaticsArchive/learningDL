[1]|260305007
is
a rare hereditary disease|84638005|32895009|103356009|32895009
caused|23981006|134198009
by a mutation|55446002
of the gene|67271001
that
directs|255589003
structural proteins|304381003
in red blood cells.|14089001|41898006|258759006|126242007

It
belongs
to a group|261586004|160481000|389109008
of four diseases|421534005|64572001
characterized
under the name Neuroacanthocytosis.|66881004

When
a patient's blood|116154003|87612001|116154003|119273009
is
viewed|246516004
under a microscope,|65473004
some
of the red blood cells|14089001|41898006|258759006|126242007
appear
thorny.|264233002

These thorny cells|264233002|4421005
are
called
acanthocytes.|63599005

Other effects|74964007|253861007
of the disease|64572001
may
include|55919000
epilepsy,|313307000
behaviour changes,|315244000
muscle degeneration,|91727004|33359002
and
neuronal degradation similar to Huntington's Disease.|47220008|40091007|58756001

The average age|424144002
of onset|77374008
of symptoms
is
35 years.|258707000

The disease|64572001
is
incurable
and
inevitably
leads|88488004|236874000
to premature death.|1090009|419620001|1090009|268923008

Chorea-acanthocytosis|66881004
is
considered
an autosomal recessive disorder,|258211005|64572001
although
a few cases|57176003|398241000|57176003|413769002
with autosomal dominant inheritance|263681008
have
been
noted.[1]
