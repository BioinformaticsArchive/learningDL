A
*
*corneal ulcer|91514001
*
*,
or
*
*ulcerative keratitis|91514001
*
*,
is
an inflammatory condition|260905004
of the cornea|28726007|181162001
involving|248448006
loss
of its outer layer.|261074009

It
is
very common|260358002|72906007
in dogs|448771007
and
is
sometimes
seen
in cats.|448169003|388618001

In veterinary medicine,|53216000|410942007
the term _corneal ulcer_|91514001
is
a generic name|18511007|27468005
for any condition|260905004
involving|248448006
the loss
of the outer layer|261074009
of the cornea,|28726007|181162001
and
as such
is
used to|394850002
describe
conditions|260905004
with
both
inflammatory
and
traumatic causes.|263904004|134198009

The cornea|28726007|181162001
is
a transparent|300828005
structure
that
is
part|260726005
of the outer layer|261074009
of the eye.|81745001|244486005

It
refracts
light|56242006|371268001
and
protects
the contents|276824008
of the eye.|81745001|244486005

The cornea|28726007|181162001
is
about one-half|421379005
to one millimeter|421379005|258673006
thick|246703001
in the dog|448771007
and
cat.|448169003|33384004|388626009

The trigeminal nerve|27612005
supplies|425398004
the cornea|28726007|181162001
via the long ciliary nerves.|280228003

There
are
pain receptors|22253000|116647005
in the outer layers|261074009
and
pressure receptors|279046003|116647005|13543005|116647005|257893003|116647005
deeper.|131197000

Transparency|300828005
is
achieved
through a lack|41277001
of blood vessels,|59820001
pigmentation,|263839000
and
keratin,|259987000|102665003
and
through the organization|21139007
of the collagen fibers.|62183001

The collagen fibers|62183001
cross|65145006
the full diameter|261015003|81827009
of the cornea|28726007|181162001
in a strictly
parallel
fashion
and
allow
99 percent|118582008
of the light to|56242006|371268001
pass
through
without scattering.|255393008

There
are
four important layers|421534005
in the dog|448771007
and
cat cornea.|448169003|28726007|448169003|181162001|33384004|28726007|33384004|181162001|388626009|28726007|388626009|181162001

The outer layer|261074009
is
the epithelium,|31610004
which
is
25
to 40 micrometers|259031006|258674000
and
five to seven cell layers|421820001|420359007|4421005|421820001|420359007|362837007
thick.|246703001

The epithelium|31610004
holds|421139008
the tear film|415747007|40431001|312608009
in place|257557008|421066005
and
also
prevents|116699007
water|11713004|119318008
from invading
the cornea|28726007|181162001
and
disrupting
the collagen fibers.|62183001

This
prevents|116699007
corneal edema,|27194006
which
gives|419582001
it a cloudy appearance.|81858005|386548000|81858005|255412001

It
is
also
a barrier
to infectious agents.|36272005

The epithelium sticks|31610004
to the basement membrane,|68989006
which also
separates|13184001|263869007
the epithelium|31610004
from the stroma.

The corneal stroma|50546002
comprises
90 percent|264705001|118582008|264703008|118582008
of the thickness|246703001
of the cornea.|28726007|181162001

It
contains|42504009
the collagen fibers|62183001
organized|385650005
into lamellae.

The lamellae
are
in sheets|255292000
which
separate|263869007
easily.|36203004

Posterior|255551008
to the stroma
is
Descemet's membrane,|42983006
which
is
a basement membrane|68989006
for the corneal endothelium.|65431007

The endothelium|27168002
is
a single cell|125681006|4421005|125681006|362837007|50607009|4421005|50607009|362837007
layer
that
separates|13184001|263869007
the cornea|28726007|181162001
from the aqueous humor.|425460003|280587006

An ulcer|429040005
of the cornea heals|28726007|298005009|181162001|298005009
by two methods|420797005|260686004|420797005|272394005
:
migration|74118003
of surrounding epithelial cells|355648006|4212006|355648006|395202001
followed|367409002
by mitosis|7041004
(
dividing|422033008
)
of the cells,|4421005
and
introduction|107733003
of blood vessels|59820001
from the conjunctiva.|29445007|181161008

Superficial small ulcers|15498001|255507004
heal|298005009
rapidly|418694008
by the first method.|255216001|260686004|255216001|272394005|232714002|260686004|232714002|272394005

However,
larger|255509001|263768009
or
deeper ulcers often|131197000|429040005|70232002
require
the presence|386397008
of blood vessels to|59820001
supply|425398004
inflammatory cells.|256923004

White blood cells|767002|52501007
and
fibroblasts|52547004
produce
granulation tissue|225541009
and
then scar tissue,|70582006|275322007
effectively
healing|298005009|90910008
the cornea.|28726007|181162001

Corneal ulcers|91514001
are
one|421379005
of the most common eye diseases|4757001|72906007|371405004
in dogs.|448771007

They
are
caused|23981006|134198009
by trauma,
detergent burns,|264299001|125666000
and
infections.

Other eye conditions|74964007|81745001|260905004|74964007|244486005|260905004
can
cause|23981006|134198009
corneal ulcers,|91514001
such as entropion,|33168009
distichiae,
corneal dystrophy,|5587004
and
keratoconjunctivitis sicca|46152009|302896008
(dry eye|46152009|1249004
).

There
have
been
at least two cases|276139006|420797005|398241000|276139006|420797005|413769002|263796003|420797005|398241000|263796003|420797005|413769002
where corneal ulceration|91514001
was
caused|23981006|134198009
by canine herpesvirus.[2]|21154001

Superficial ulcers|15498001
involve|248448006
a loss
of part|260726005
of the epithelium.|31610004

Deep ulcers|131197000|429040005
extend|255590007
into
or
through the stroma
and
can
result|394617004
in severe scarring|24484000|24484000|275322007
and
corneal perforation.|74895004

*
*Descemetoceles|83110007
*
*
occur|272120004
when
the ulcer|429040005
extends|255590007
through the stroma,
exposing|24932003
Descemet's membrane.|42983006

This type|261664005
of ulcer|429040005
is
especially dangerous
and
can
result|394617004
in perforation.|263837003

The location|246267002
of the ulcer|429040005
depends
somewhat
on the cause.|134198009

Central ulcers|26216008|429040005
are
typically
caused|23981006|134198009
by trauma,
dry eye,|46152009|1249004
or
exposure|71677004|24932003
from facial nerve paralysis|422426003|280816001
or
exophthalmos.|18265008

Ulcers|429040005
in the inferior nasal cornea|261089000|260540009|28726007|261089000|260540009|181162001|261089000|28726007|261089000|181162001
may
be
caused|23981006|134198009
by foreign material|125670008
trapped|403833009
under the third eyelid.|113326005

Entropion|33168009
or
distichiae
may
cause|23981006|134198009
ulceration|429040005
of the peripheral cornea.|244495002

Immune-mediated eye disease|41266007|73510009|81745001|41266007|73510009|244486005|255386009|73510009|371405004
can
cause|23981006|134198009
ulcers|429040005
at the border|112233002
of the cornea|28726007|181162001
and
sclera.[3]|18619003|181163006

Corneal ulcers|91514001
are
painful|22253000
due to nerve exposure,|3057000|71677004|3057000|24932003|256864008|71677004|256864008|24932003
and
can
cause|23981006|134198009
tearing,|415747007|40431001|312608009|418035005
squinting|22066006
,
and
pawing|95936004
at the eye.|81745001|244486005

There
may
also
be
signs|72670004
of anterior uveitis,|410692006|4927003
such as miosis|63251006|415219007
(small pupil|63251006|415219007|418683009
)
,
aqueous flare
(protein|88878007
in the aqueous humour,|425460003|280587006
and
redness|386713009|371240000
of the eye.|81745001|244486005

An axon reflex|60436000|87572000|60436000|106146005
may
be
responsible|394851003
for uveitis formation ? stimulation|128473001|11798007|122545008|128473001|255277001|122545008
of pain receptors|22253000|116647005
in the cornea|28726007|181162001
results|394617004
in release inflammatory mediators|58000006|49352002|68776005|49352002|258760001|49352002|129299003|49352002|115956009|49352002
such as prostaglandins,|26351002
histamine,|54235008
and
acetylcholine.[4]|57308006|104460004

Diagnosis|439401001
is
through direct observation|255589003|103705002
of the ulcer|429040005
with the use|277889008|419385000
of fluorescein stain,|85596006|406859001
which
is
taken|419652001
up
by exposed corneal stroma|24932003|50546002
and
appears
green.|371246006

With descemetoceles,|83110007
Descemet's membrane|42983006
will
bulge|442672001
forward|255540008
and
after staining|127790008
will
appear
as a dark circle|255419005|354652004
with a green boundary,|371246006
because
it
does
not
absorb
the stain.|397165007|127790008

Other tests|74964007|269814003|74964007|272393004
that
may
be
necessary
include|55919000
a Schirmer's test|164742009
for keratoconjunctivitis sicca|46152009|302896008
and
an analysis|272389005
of facial nerve function|112106009
for facial nerve paralysis.|422426003|280816001

Treatment|276239002|416118004
of corneal ulcers|91514001
includes|55919000
topical antibiotic therapy to|281789004|359540000|281789004
prevent
infection,
and
pain medications,|22253000|410942007
including|55919000
topical atropine to|372832002|359540000|372832002
stop|422117008
spasms|45352006
of the ciliary muscle.|9668006|280862009

Atropine|372832002
may
decrease|260400001|260370003
tear production|64702000
and
interfere|78235001
with corneal healing.|28726007|298005009|28726007|90910008

Superficial ulcers usually|15498001
heal|298005009
in less|276139006|263796003
than a week.|258705008|259038000

Deep ulcers|131197000|429040005
and
descemetoceles|83110007
may
require
corneal suturing,|28726007|18557009
conjunctival grafts|29445007|24486003
or
conjunctival flaps,|29445007|256683004
soft contact lenses,|313015008
or
corneal transplant.|293820001

Topical corticosteroids|331645009
and
anesthetics|394577000|373266007
should
not
be
used|394850002
on any type|261664005
of corneal ulcer|91514001
because
they
prevent
healing|298005009|90910008
and
will
often|70232002
make
them worse.|230993007|390772001|231877006

A new bioscaffold|7147002
developed
by TR BioSurgical
is
being
evaluated
for refractory corneal ulcers|20646008|91514001
in dogs.|448771007

The study|110465008|224699009
is
being
conducted|844005
by board certified veterinary ophthalmologists|53216000|422234006
and
has
shown
promise
in healing refractory ulcers|25845007|20646008|125313005|20646008
that
have
failed conventional treatment .[6]|255333006|276239002|255333006|416118004

Refractory corneal ulcers|20646008|91514001
are
superficial ulcers|15498001
that
heal|298005009
poorly|556001
and
tend
to
recur.|246455001

They
are
also
known|36692007
as
*
*indolent ulcers|405719001|296375005
*
*
or
*
*Boxer ulcers|42250008|429040005
*
*.

They
are
believed
to
be
caused|23981006|134198009
by a defect|6920004
in the basement membrane|68989006
and
a lack|41277001
of hemidesmosomal attachments.|12626005|1431002

They
are
recognized
by undermined epithelium|31610004
that
surrounds|355648006
the ulcer|429040005
and
easily|36203004
peels|257890000|51979000
back.

Refractory corneal ulcers|20646008|91514001
are
most commonly|4757001
seen
in middle aged|28288005
or
older dogs|70753007|448771007|70753007
and
often|70232002
occur|272120004
in the other eye later.|74964007|81745001|74964007|244486005

They
are
similar to Cogan's cystic dystrophy|441457006|4720007|20476009|4720007
in humans.|278412004

[1]|260305007

Refractory corneal ulcers|20646008|91514001
can
take|419652001
a long time|255511005|410669006
to heal, sometimes months.|298005009|258706009

Topical antibiotics|255631004|359540000|255631004
are
used|394850002
continually to
prevent
infection.

Pain medications|22253000|410942007
are
given|419582001
as
needed.|410525008|103325001

Loose epithelium|78799005|31610004
is
removed|127485006
with a dry cotton swab|13880007|51627003|257261003|13880007|51627003|285570007|13880007|51627003|408098004|13880007|91299008|257261003|13880007|91299008|285570007|13880007|91299008|408098004|13880007|54000004|257261003|13880007|54000004|285570007|13880007|54000004|408098004|13880007|256246007|257261003|13880007|256246007|285570007|13880007|256246007|408098004
under topical anesthesia.|386760001

This
is
in order to
allow
production
of normal basement membrane|17621005|68989006|258744000|68989006
and
division|118630004
of normal epithelium.|17621005|31610004|258744000|31610004

Often further treatment|70232002|46053002|276239002|70232002|46053002|416118004
is
necessary,
such as a keratotomy,|62935003
which
is
superficial cutting|26283006|70302008|26283006|410717008
or
piercing
of the cornea.|28726007|181162001

There
are
two main types|420797005|63161005|261664005
used|394850002
in dogs|448771007
:
multiple punctate keratotomy (MPK)|260396001|7800008|62935003
and
grid keratotomy (GK).|62935003

MPK
involves|248448006
making small superficial punctures|255507004|26283006|11639007|255507004|26283006|85921004
into the cornea|28726007|181162001
with a needle.|79068005

GK
is
more commonly|242762006
used|394850002
and
involves|248448006
making parallel
and
perpendicular scratches|131189007|40590001|131189007|53181008
in the corneal surface.|314853007

Usually only topical anesthesia|386760001
is
necessary.

By scoring|278061009
the corneal surface,|314853007
anchoring|122502001
points
are
provided
for attachment|1431002
of new epithelium.|7147002|31610004

Of course,|288524001
these procedures|71388002
should
only
be
performed|398166005
by a veterinarian, particularly|106290006
one|421379005
with some experience
in this treatment.|276239002|416118004

Complete healing|255594003|298005009|255594003|90910008
takes|419652001
about three|421291004
to four weeks.|421534005|258705008

Keratotomies|62935003
may
lead|88488004
to corneal sequestration|28726007|263870008
in cats.|448169003|388618001

Other medications|74964007|410942007
have
been
shown
to
be
useful
in topical treatment|276239002|416118004|359540000|276239002|359540000|416118004
of refractory ulcers,|20646008|429040005
including|55919000
glycosaminoglycans|82565009
such as sodium hyaluronate[8]|387578003
and
chondroitin sulfate,|4104007
[9] aminocaproic acid,|59882007
[10]
and
acetylcysteine.[11]|387440002

Melting ulcers|429040005
are
a type|261664005
of corneal ulcer|91514001
involving|248448006
progressive loss|255314001
of stroma
in a dissolving fashion.|421682005

This
is
most commonly|4757001
seen
in _Pseudomonas_ infection,|63398001
but
it
can
be
caused|23981006|134198009
by other types|74964007|261664005
of bacteria|409822003
or
fungi.|414561005

These infectious agents|36272005
produce
proteases|130202003|116536008
and
collagenases|417416003
which break down|263690001
the corneal stroma.|50546002

Complete loss|255594003
of the stroma
can
occur|272120004
within 24 hours.|123027009|259029002

Treatment|276239002|416118004
includes|55919000
antibiotics|255631004
and
collagenase inhibitors|417416003|61511001
such as acetylcysteine|387440002
and
homologous blood serum.|67922002

Surgery|83578000
may
be
necessary.

Corneal ulcers|91514001
in cats|448169003|388618001
can
be
caused|23981006|134198009
by trauma,
detergent burns,|264299001|125666000
infections,
and
other eye diseases.|74964007|371405004

One common cause|421379005|72906007|134198009
not
seen
in dogs|448771007
is
infection
with feline herpesvirus 1 (FHV-1).|139001

FHV-1
causes|134198009
ulceration|429040005
by direct infection|255589003
of the epithelial cells.|4212006|395202001

Lesions
appear
as round|42700002
or
dendritic|90604005|255337007
(branching|77796000
)
ulcers.|429040005

FHV-1 also
suppresses|245780008
healing|298005009|90910008
of the cornea.|28726007|181162001

Symptoms
include|55919000
conjunctivitis,|9826008
squinting|22066006
,
eye discharge,|246679005
and
blood vessels|59820001
on the cornea.|28726007|181162001

It
can
cause|23981006|134198009
severe scarring.|24484000|24484000|275322007

Treatment|276239002|416118004
is
with topical antiviral drugs|372701006|359540000|372701006
and
antibiotics,|255631004
and
oral L-lysine,|260548002|418834008
which
competes
with arginine|52625008
and
inhibits|61511001
viral replication.[7]|74256009

Corneal ulceration|91514001
is
a very common disease|260358002|72906007|64572001
of the equine eye|35354009|81745001|35354009|244486005
and
can
have
sight-threatening consequences.|281004000|103332005

Aggressive treatment|61372001|276239002|61372001|416118004|276239002|416118004
is
always
indicated|410535002
,
as
even apparently mild ulcers|255604002|429040005
can
progress|385651009
quickly,
causing|23981006
serious complications.|42745003|116223007

A distinct cause|134198009
for initial ulceration|884001|429040005|232714002|429040005
is
not commonly
found|404684003
,
although
in many cases|398241000|413769002
it
can
be
assumed
to
be
traumatic|263904004
in origin.|255395001

The horse's eye|35354009|81745001|35354009|244486005|388441000|81745001|388441000|244486005|388445009|81745001|388445009|244486005
is
especially vulnerable
to trauma
due to its prominent position,|4657009|246449006
compared
with other species.|74964007|69658003

Exposure keratitis|14366000
(inflamed cornea|28726007|181162001
)
can
occur|272120004
in the horse,|35354009|388441000|388445009
most commonly secondary|2603003|81170007
to facial nerve paralysis.|422426003|280816001

Hospitalised animals|184091000|387961004
have
been
shown
to
have
a decreased corneal reflex,|103254005
and
this
corresponds
to an increased incidence|35105006|260366006
of ulcers|429040005
in the hospitalised population.|184091000|385436007|184091000|389109008

Foreign bodies|125670008
embedded
in the palpebral conjunctiva|15768007
or
the nictitating membrane|113326005
can
cause|23981006|134198009
persistent irritation|257553007
and
ulceration.|429040005

Often|70232002
the shape|107644003|246176004|300842002
and
distribution|255464007
of the lesion
is
suggestive|7196007
of this aetiology,|134198009
but
even
in the absence|2667000|418560003
of a characteristic lesion
their presence|386397008
should
be
considered
and
sought
out.|255529000

Bacterial|409822003
and
fungal infection|3218000
occurs|272120004
readily
after the initial ulceration,|884001|429040005|232714002|429040005
as
disruption|76555007
of the corneal epithelium|15775008|368825001
allows
attachment|1431002
and
colonisation
of the underlying tissues|85756007
by normal corneal commensals.|17621005|28726007|284685002|258744000|28726007|284685002

Commonly isolated bacteria|46651001|409822003
include|55919000
Staphylococcus,|65119002
Streptococcus|58800005
and
Pseudomonas,|5274006
and
empirical anti-microbial therapy|371018001
should
be
effective|255403003|254648000
against these bacteria.|409822003

Differential diagnoses|47965005
for the painful equine eye|41652007|35354009
:

A full ocular exam|261015003|81745001|225886003|261015003|281004000|225886003|261015003|225886003
should
be
performed|398166005
for every case|398241000
of eye pain.|41652007

Fluoroscein staining|127790008
is
usually diagnostic|439401001|261004008
for corneal ulcers,|91514001
although
staining|127790008
with Rose Bengal|82411007
is
also
recommended
as
it
can
pick up early viral/fungal lesions,|255532002|264499004|414561005|353734004|264499004|414561005
which
will
appear
as multifocal disturbances|524008
to the tear film.|415747007|40431001|312608009

Culture|252398009|61594008
and
sensitivity|35209006|365705006
is
recommended
for rapidly progressive|418694008|255314001
or
deep corneal ulcers.|131197000|91514001

Cotton swabbing|51627003|257261003|91299008|257261003|54000004|257261003|256246007|257261003
is
often inadequate,|70232002|71978007
and
corneal scraping,|28726007|56757003
for example,
with the blunt side|182353008
of a scalpel blade|102308008
is
usually
required.

This
can
be
greatly
facilitated
by the use|277889008|419385000
of local nerve blocks|255470001|64874008
and
topical anaesthesia.|386760001

There
is
almost invariably
a secondary uveitis present|2603003|128473001|52101004|2603003|128473001|246105001|81170007|128473001|52101004|81170007|128473001|246105001
with corneal ulceration,|91514001
and
signs|72670004
of this
may
also
be
seen
:
miosis,|63251006|415219007
corneal oedema,|27194006
aqueous flare,
hypopyon,|87807004
IOP changes.|243326001|263703002

Medical therapy|243121000
should
be
based|418836005
upon the severity|272141005
of disease initially,|64572001|884001
and
then
by the response
to therapy.|276239002

The aims
of the initial therapy|884001|276239002|232714002|276239002
are
:

The initial choice|884001|232714002
of antibiotic|255631004
depends
upon personal choice,
experience
and
availability,|103328004
but
could
include|55919000
chloramphenicol,|372777009
chlortetracycline,|373509001
bacitracin-neomycin-polymyxin (BNP),|5220000|373528008|373224006
ciprofloxacin,|392412000
ofloxacin|387551000
and
tobramycin.|373548001

Topical gentamicin formulations|387321007|411310000|359540000|387321007|359540000|411310000
are
also available,|103328004
but
in the opinion
of some,
should
be
reserved
for cases|398241000|413769002
with stromal melting.

Frequency|260864003|272123002
of application|410618006
can
vary
from q1h
to q8h,|307469008
depending
on both
the severity|272141005
of the lesion,
and
the formulation
used|394850002
(ointment|385101003
vs.

drops|426684005|404218003
).

Much
of the pain|22253000
associated|47429007
with corneal ulceration|91514001
is
due to the secondary uveitis|2603003|128473001|81170007|128473001
and
miosis,|63251006|415219007
and
effective relief|255403003|224978009|254648000|224978009
can
often|70232002
be
gained|35105006|255396000|260366006|260369004|398092000
with topical atropine|372832002|359540000|372832002
(1%|260305007
)
,
leading|236874000
to mydriasis.|37125009

Dosing
is
generally q4h initially,|225756002|884001
and
then
as
required to
maintain|385630006
dilation.|25322007|71025006|363105001

Mydriasis|37125009
is
also important to
avoid
some
of the complications|116223007
associated|47429007
with uveitis,|128473001
such as synechiae formation|78778007|11798007|78778007|255277001
and
glaucoma.|23986001

Pain|22253000
is
also
associated|47429007
with inflammatory response
occurring|272120004
in the adjacent sclera|18769003|18619003|18769003|181163006
and
conjunctiva,|29445007|181161008
and
systemic analgesia|31099001|278414003|31099001|38433004
in the form|246176004
of NSAIDs|372665008
is
usually
indicated|410535002
,
for example,
flunixin meglumin 1.1 mg/kg,|96173008
BID.

Topical NSAIDs|372665008|359540000|372665008
are
available|103328004
(diclofenac,|7034005
flurbiprofen|373506008
)
and
effective,|255403003|254648000
but
have
been
shown
to
increase|260366006
corneal healing time.|28726007|298005009|410669006|28726007|90910008|410669006

In horses|35354009
that
are
difficult to|52925006
treat|395077000
,
or
in cases|398241000|413769002
that
require
very frequent treatment,|260358002|70232002|276239002|260358002|70232002|416118004
then placement|257867005
of a sub-palpebral lavage system|261089000|80243003|67889009|246333005|118555000|80243003|67889009|246333005
can
be
very useful.|260358002

As an adjunct
to therapy,|276239002
physical protection|5880005|19388002
of the eye|81745001|244486005
may
be
required
,
in the form|246176004
of a mask.|261382003

Some horses|35354009
will
rub
their eyes|81745001
in response
to pain,|22253000
and
this
can
cause|23981006|134198009
further corneal damage.|46053002|28726007|37782003

Box rest|415183006|258157001
is
also vital,|260410005
as
over-exertion|419912001
has
been
linked
to intra-ocular haemorrhage|417244000
and
increased severity|35105006|272141005|260366006|272141005
of uveitis.|128473001

Success|385669000
in your therapeutic regime|262202000
can
be
judged|11205001
by a reduction|58294000|260400001|289928003
in pain,|22253000
and
a decrease|260400001|260370003
in size|277049003
of the ulcer.|429040005

Healing|298005009|90910008
generally
occurs|272120004
rapidly|418694008
at first,|255216001|232714002
followed|367409002
by a slowing|419443000
after 5?7 days.|264706000|258703001|264605009|258703001

As a rough guide,|106384005|303479009
a non-infected ulcer|55189008|429040005
can
be
expected
to heal|298005009
at approximately 0.6mm/day.|26175008|258703001|26175008|259032004

In cases|398241000|413769002
where the ulcer|429040005
is
not healing|298005009|90910008
:

Melting ulcers|429040005
reflect|225436004
inappropriate collagenolysis|6320008
of the corneal stroma,|50546002
by matrix-metalloproteinases (MMPs).|130355006

Bacterial pathogens|409822003|264418008
(especially Pseudomonas|5274006
and ?-haemolytic Streptococcus|278215000|58800005|73320003|58800005
)
induce|16404004
the corneal epithelial cells|28726007|4212006|28726007|395202001
and
resident leucocytes to|405277009|52501007
upregulate
pro-inflammatory,|52541003
and
MMP-activating cytokines|75777003
(IL-1,-|50762005
6
and -
8

These bacteria|409822003
can
also
produce
their own proteinases.|130202003|116536008

The combination|89780004
of exogenous,|261074009|51352008
and
upregulated endogenous, proteinases|73979006|130202003|73979006|116536008
leads|88488004|236874000
to a rapid breakdown|255358001|40091007|255358001|125366008
of collagen,|61472002
with the characteristic melting appearance.|386548000|255412001

Untreated|25265005
this
can
lead|88488004
to perforation|263837003
within 12 hours|259028005|123035007
(so|223528007
act
hard|72505002
and
fast!|16985007|277748003
).

There
are
several therapeutic options|261028005|262202000
for inhibiting MMPs|61511001
:

A combination|89780004
of the above|261183002
may
be
necessary early|264499004
in the disease course.|246453008

Effective antibiosis|255403003|255631004|254648000|255631004
is
also paramount,
and
gentamicin|387321007|411310000
is
a good empirical choice|20572008
(
although
there
are
some
reports|229059009|223458004
of gentamicin-resistant Pseudomonas species|387321007|30714006|5274006|387321007|30714006|116493000|411310000|30714006|5274006|411310000|30714006|116493000
).

Obviously,
treating|28995006
an eye|81745001|244486005
this frequently in practice|70232002
will
be
difficult,|52925006
so
referral|3457005
is
probably
the best option.
