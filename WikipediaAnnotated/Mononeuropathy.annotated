*Peripheral neuropathy|42658009
*
*
is
damage|37782003
to nerves|3057000
of the peripheral nervous system,|3058005
which
may
be
caused|23981006|134198009
either
by diseases|64572001
of
or
trauma
to the nerve|3057000|256864008
or
the side effects
of systemic illness.[1]|264578000

The four cardinal patterns|421534005|62375001|272135003
of peripheral neuropathy|42658009
are
polyneuropathy,|42345000
mononeuropathy,|128189008
mononeuritis multiplex|30292005
and
autonomic neuropathy.|277879009

The most common form|4757001|72906007|246176004
is
(symmetrical|18772005
)
peripheral polyneuropathy,|14414005|42345000
which mainly
affects|4065008
the feet|56459004|259051005
and
legs.|30021000

The form|246176004
of neuropathy|386033004
may
be
further broken down|46053002|263690001
by cause,|134198009
or
the size|277049003
of predominant fiber involvement,|116272000|248448006|400293002|248448006|87028007|248448006|37202001|248448006
i.e.,|42146005|22971001
large fiber|255509001|116272000|255509001|400293002|255509001|87028007|255509001|37202001
or
small fiber peripheral neuropathy.|255507004|116272000|42658009|255507004|400293002|42658009|255507004|87028007|42658009|255507004|37202001|42658009

Frequently|70232002
the cause|134198009
of a neuropathy|386033004
cannot
be
identified|7882003
and
it
is
designated
as
being
idiopathic.|54690008

Neuropathy|386033004
may
be
associated|47429007
with varying combinations|228166004
of weakness,|13791008|260407003
autonomic changes,|72167002|243326001|72167002|263703002
and
sensory changes.|262139008|243326001|262139008|263703002

Loss
of muscle bulk|271696003
or
fasciculations,|82470000
a particular fine twitching|3082000|60238002
of muscle,|91727004
may
be
seen.

Sensory symptoms|162246009
encompass
loss
of sensation|106148006|271712005|272144002
and
"positive" phenomena|258758003|10828004
including|55919000
pain.|22253000

Symptoms
depend
on the type|261664005
of nerves|3057000
affected|247591002|248448006
(motor,
sensory,|262139008
or
autonomic|72167002
and
where the nerves|3057000
are
located
in the body.|279495008|123037004

One|421379005
or
more types|242762006|261664005
of nerves|3057000
may
be
affected.|247591002|248448006

Common symptoms|72906007
associated|47429007
with damage|37782003
to the motor nerve|3057000|256864008
are
muscle weakness,|26544005
cramps,|55300003
and
spasms.|45352006

Loss
of balance|249982003|78933003|282295000
and
coordination|85352007
may
also
occur.|272120004

Damage|37782003
to the sensory nerve|262139008|3057000|262139008|256864008
can
produce
tingling,|162249002
numbness,|398026008|44077006
and
a burning pain.|36349006

Pain|22253000
associated|47429007
with this nerve|3057000|256864008
is
described
in various ways|256220008
such as the following|255260001
:
burning,|90673000|62404004
freezing|48103003
,
or
electric-|18213006
like,
extreme sensitivity|12565001|35209006|12565001|365705006
to touch.|386476006|52962008|397624008

The autonomic nerve damage|53520000|37782003|276145003|37782003|72167002|57182000
causes|134198009
problems|55607006
with involuntary functions|246464006
leading|236874000
to symptoms
such as abnormal blood pressure|38936003
and
heart rate,|364075005
reduced ability to|260400001|371150009
perspire|161857006
,
constipation,|14760008
bladder dysfunction|40492006
(
e.g.
,
incontinence|48340000|165232002
)
,
and
sexual dysfunction.[3]|56627002|231532002

Peripheral neuropathy|42658009
may
be
classified|73504009
according to the number|410680006|410681005
of nerves|3057000
affected|247591002|248448006
or
the type|261664005
of nerve cell|47220008
affected|247591002|248448006
(motor,
sensory,|262139008
autonomic|72167002
)
,
or
the process|415178003
affecting|247591002|248448006
the nerves|3057000
(e.g.|258795003

inflammation|257552002
in neuritis|128192007
).

*
*Mononeuropathy|128189008
*
*
is
a type|261664005
of neuropathy|386033004
that only|50607009|420295001
affects|4065008
a single nerve.|125681006|3057000|125681006|256864008|50607009|3057000|50607009|256864008

It
is
diagnostically useful to
distinguish
them
from polyneuropathies,|42345000
because
the limitation|246175000
in scope
makes
it more likely|242762006|2931005
that
the cause|134198009
is
a localized trauma|255471002|255471002
or
infection.

The most common cause|4757001|72906007|134198009
of mononeuropathy|128189008
is
by physical compression|5880005|71173004|5880005|263720003|19388002|71173004|19388002|263720003
of the nerve,|3057000|256864008
known|36692007
as compression neuropathy.|45781009

Carpal tunnel syndrome|246611002
and
axillary nerve palsy|74858004|44695005|181009006|44695005
are
examples
of this.

The "pins-|77444004
and-
needles" sensation|79068005|106148006|79068005|271712005|79068005|272144002
of one's "foot falling asleep"|421379005|56459004|1912002|248220008|421379005|259051005|1912002|248220008|421379005|302545001|1912002|248220008
(paresthesia|91019004
is
caused|23981006|134198009
by a compression mononeuropathy,|71173004|128189008|263720003|128189008
_[citation
needed|410525008|103325001

albeit
a temporary one|14803004|421379005
which
can
be
resolved
merely
by moving
around
and
adjusting|410617001
to a more appropriate position.|242762006|246449006

Direct injury|255589003
to a nerve,|3057000|256864008
interruption|76555007
of its blood supply|87612001|425398004|119273009|425398004
(ischemia,|52674009
or
inflammation|257552002
can
also
cause|23981006|134198009
mononeuropathy.|128189008

*
*Mononeuritis multiplex|30292005
*
*
is
simultaneous|79970003
or
sequential involvement|248448006
of individual noncontiguous nerve trunks,|125676002|3057000|22943007|125676002|3057000|262225004|125676002|256864008|22943007|125676002|256864008|262225004|385435006|3057000|22943007|385435006|3057000|262225004|385435006|256864008|22943007|385435006|256864008|262225004
either
partially
or
completely,
evolving|59381007
over days|258703001
to years|258707000
and
typically
presenting|246105001
with acute|272118002
or
subacute loss|19939008
of sensory|262139008
and
motor function|52479005
of individual nerves.|125676002|3057000|385435006|3057000

The pattern|272135003
of involvement|248448006
is
asymmetric|4128009
;
however,
as
the disease|64572001
progresses|385651009
deficit|260372006|248325000
(s)
becomes
more confluent|242762006|74832004
and
symmetrical,|18772005
making
it difficult to|52925006
differentiate|263933003
from polyneuropathy.|42345000

Therefore,
attention|6769007
to the pattern|272135003
of early symptoms|264499004
is
important.

Mononeuritis multiplex|30292005
may
also
cause|23981006|134198009
pain,|22253000
which
is
characterized
as deep,|131197000
aching|410711009
pain|22253000
that
is
worse|230993007|390772001|231877006
at night,|2546009
is
frequently|70232002
in the lower back,|37822005|264072009
hip,|29836001|85710004
or
leg.|61685007|30021000|182281004|362793004

In people|125676002
with diabetes mellitus,|73211009
mononeuritis multiplex|30292005
is
typically
encountered
as acute, unilateral, severe thigh pain|274663001|66459002|24484000|68367000|274663001|66459002|24484000|302544002|272118002|66459002|76948002|68367000|272118002|66459002|76948002|302544002|272118002|66459002|24484000|78514002
followed|367409002
by anterior muscle weakness|255549009|255549009|26544005
and
loss
of knee reflex.|271714006

Electrodiagnostic studies|110465008|224699009
will
show
multifocal sensory motor axonal neuropathy.|230591002|262139008|60436000

It
is
caused|23981006|134198009
by,
or
associated|47429007
with,
several medical conditions|261028005|74188005|260905004
:

*
*Polyneuropathy|42345000
*
*
is
a pattern|272135003
of nerve damage|57182000
which
is
quite different|263735002
from mononeuropathy,|128189008
and
often more serious|70232002|42745003
and
affecting more areas|247591002|42798000|248448006|42798000
of the body.|279495008|123037004

The term "peripheral neuropathy"|42658009
is
sometimes
used|394850002
loosely to
refer|439980006
to polyneuropathy.|42345000

In cases|398241000|413769002
of polyneuropathy,|42345000
many nerve cells|47220008
in various parts|256220008|260726005
of the body|279495008|123037004
are
affected|247591002|248448006
,
without regard
to the nerve|3057000|256864008
through which
they
pass
;
not
all nerve cells|47220008
are
affected|247591002|248448006
in any particular case.|398241000

In distal axonopathy,|46053002
one common pattern|421379005|72906007|272135003
is
that
the cell bodies|4421005|279495008|4421005|123037004|362837007|279495008|362837007|123037004
of neurons|47220008
remain
intact,|11163003
but
the axons|60436000
are
affected|247591002|248448006
in proportion|8212001
to their length.|410668003

Diabetic neuropathy|230572002
is
the most common cause|4757001|72906007|134198009
of this pattern.|272135003

In demyelinating polyneuropathies,|23414001
the myelin sheath|23879005
around axons|60436000
is
damaged,|37782003
which
affects|4065008
the ability|371150009
of the axons to|60436000
conduct|844005
electrical impulses.|18213006|263781002|258096005|263781002

The third|70905002
and
least common pattern|276139006|72906007|272135003|263796003|72906007|272135003
affects|4065008
the cell bodies|4421005|279495008|4421005|123037004|362837007|279495008|362837007|123037004
of neurones directly.|47220008

This usually
picks
out
either
the motor neurones|31513005
(
known|36692007
as motor neurone disease|37340000
or
the sensory neurones|262139008|47220008
(
known|36692007
as
_sensory neuronopathy_|262139008
or
_dorsal root ganglionopathy_|25938006
).

The effect|253861007
of this
is
to
cause|23981006|134198009
symptoms
in more|242762006
than one part|421379005|260726005
of the body,|279495008|123037004
often|70232002
on left|7771000
and
right sides symmetrically.|24028007

As for any neuropathy,|386033004
the chief symptoms
include|55919000
weakness|13791008|260407003
or
clumsiness|7006003
of movement|255324009
(motor
)
;
unusual
or
unpleasant sensations|106148006|272144002
such as tingling|162249002
or
burning|90673000|62404004
;
reduction|58294000|260400001|289928003
in the ability to|371150009
feel|285854004
texture,|246200002
temperature,|105723007|246508008
etc.
;
and
impaired balance|298313002
when
standing|10904000
or
walking|129006008
(sensory|262139008
).

In many polyneuropathies,|42345000
these symptoms
occur|272120004
first|255216001|232714002
and
most severely|4757001|24484000
in the feet.|56459004|259051005

Autonomic symptoms|72167002
may
also
occur|272120004
,
such as dizziness|404640003|399153001
on standing|10904000
up,
erectile dysfunction|397803000
and
difficulty controlling urination.|102835006|54776003|102835006|31509003

Polyneuropathies|42345000
are
usually
caused|23981006|134198009
by processes|415178003
that
affect|4065008
the body|279495008|123037004
as a whole.|260232004

Diabetes|73211009
and
impaired glucose tolerance|267426009
are
the most common causes.|4757001|72906007|134198009

Other causes|74964007|134198009
relate|272151006|262094002
to the particular type|261664005
of polyneuropathy,|42345000
and
there
are
many different causes|260396001|263735002|134198009
of each type,|261664005
including|55919000
inflammatory diseases|128139000
such as lyme disease,|23502006
vitamin deficiencies,|85670002
blood disorders,|34093004
and
toxins|80917008
(
including|55919000
alcohol|419442005|53041004|430837008
and
certain prescribed drugs|17162000|410942007
).

Most types|261664005
of polyneuropathy|42345000
progress|385651009
fairly slowly,|419443000
over months|258706009
or
years,|258707000
but
rapidly progressive polyneuropathy also|418694008|255314001|42345000
occurs.|272120004

It
is
important to
recognize
that glucose levels|365811003
in the blood|87612001|119273009
can
spike
to nerve-damaging levels|3057000|258395000|256864008|258395000
after eating even|48263008
though
fasting blood sugar levels|258395000|16985007|33747003|16985007|365812005
and
average blood glucose levels|365812005
can
still
remain
below normal levels|17621005|258395000|258744000|258395000
(currently typically|15240007
considered
below 100
for fasting blood plasma|16985007|419185008
and
6.0
for HGBA1c,
the test commonly|269814003|272393004
used|394850002
to
measure|246445000|272391002
average blood glucose levels|365812005

).

Studies|110465008|224699009
have
shown
that many|260396001
of the cases|398241000|413769002
of peripheral small fiber neuropathy|42658009|255507004|116272000|42658009|255507004|400293002|42658009|255507004|87028007|42658009|255507004|37202001
with typical symptoms
of tingling,|162249002
pain|22253000
and
loss
of sensation|106148006|271712005|272144002
in the feet|56459004|259051005
and
hands|85562004
are
due to glucose intolerance|267426009
before a diagnosis|439401001
of diabetes|73211009
or
pre-diabetes.

Such damage|37782003
is
often reversible, particularly|70232002|35174006
in the early stages,|264499004|261612004
with diet,|41829006
exercise|61686008
and
weight loss.|89362005

The treatment|276239002|416118004
of polyneuropathies|42345000
is
aimed firstly|232714002
at eliminating
or
controlling|54776003|31509003
the cause,|134198009
secondly|81170007
at maintaining muscle strength|385630006|91727004|260404005
and
physical function,|5880005|246464006|19388002|246464006
and
thirdly|70905002
at controlling symptoms|54776003|31509003
such as neuropathic pain.|247398009

*Autonomic neuropathy|277879009
*
*
is
a form|246176004
of polyneuropathy|42345000
which
affects|4065008
the non-voluntary, non-sensory nervous system|255375007|262139008|25087005|255375007|262139008|278196006
(i.e.,|42146005|22971001
the autonomic nervous system|72167002
affecting|247591002|248448006
mostly
the internal organs|260521003|410653004
such as the bladder muscles,|279412007
the cardiovascular system,|113257007|278198007
the digestive tract,|122865005
and
the genital organs.|263767004|128181006

These nerves|3057000
are
not
under a person's conscious control|125676002|31509003
and
function|246464006
automatically.

Autonomic nerve fibers|53520000|400293002|53520000|37202001|276145003|400293002|276145003|37202001|72167002|88545005
form|246176004
large collections|255509001
in the thorax,|261179002|302551006
abdomen|277112006|52731004|302553009
and
pelvis|277113001|21844003|229765004
outside spinal cord,|2748008|180959008
however
they
have
connections|263538003
with the spinal cord|2748008|180959008
and
ultimately
the brain.|12738006|258335003

Most commonly autonomic neuropathy|4757001|277879009
is
seen
in persons|125676002
with long-standing diabetes mellitus type 1|255511005|10904000|46635009
and
2.

In most
but
not
all cases,|398241000|413769002
autonomic neuropathy|277879009
occurs|272120004
alongside other forms|74964007|246176004
of neuropathy,|386033004
such as sensory neuropathy.|95662005

Autonomic neuropathy|277879009
is
one|421379005
cause|23981006|134198009
of malfunction|76797004|386585008
of the autonomic nervous system,|72167002
but
not
the only one|50607009|421379005|420295001|421379005
;
some
conditions|78326006|260905004
affecting|247591002|248448006
the brain|12738006|258335003
or
spinal cord|2748008|180959008
can
also
cause|23981006|134198009
autonomic dysfunction,|72167002|386585008
such as multiple system atrophy,|16576004|230297002
and
therefore
cause|23981006|134198009
similar symptoms
to autonomic neuropathy.|277879009

The signs|72670004
and
symptoms
of autonomic neuropathy|277879009
include|55919000
the following|255260001
:

*
*Neuritis|128192007
*
*
is
a general term|36456004
for inflammation|257552002
of a nerve[6]|3057000|256864008
or
the general inflammation|60132005|257552002
of the peripheral nervous system.|3058005

Symptoms
depend
on the nerves|3057000
involved|248448006
,
but
may
include|55919000
pain,|22253000
paresthesia|91019004
(pins & needles|62507009
)
,
paresis
(weakness|13791008|260407003
)
,
hypoesthesia|398026008
(numbness|398026008|44077006
)
,
anesthesia,|399097000|394577000|33653009
paralysis,|44695005
wasting
,
and
disappearance
of the reflexes.|87572000|106146005

Causes|134198009
include|55919000
:

Types|261664005
of neuritis|128192007
include|55919000
:

Those with diseases|20401003|64572001|421463005|64572001
or
dysfunctions|386585008
of their nerves|3057000
can
present|52101004|246105001
with problems|55607006
in any
of the normal nerve functions.|17621005|3057000|246464006|17621005|256864008|246464006|258744000|3057000|246464006|258744000|256864008|246464006

In terms
of sensory function,|106148006
there
are
commonly _loss
of function_|246464006
(_negative_) symptoms,|260385009
which
include|55919000
numbness,|398026008|44077006
tremor,|26079004
and
gait abnormality.|22325002

Gain
of function|246464006
(positive|258758003|10828004
)
symptoms
include|55919000
tingling,|162249002
pain,|22253000
itching|424492005
,
crawling,|418594001
and
pins|77444004
and
needles.|79068005

Pain|22253000
can
become
intense enough to|103370009
require
use|277889008|419385000
of opioid|404642006
(narcotic
)
drugs|410942007
(i.e.,|42146005|22971001
morphine,|373529000|442759006
oxycodone|55452001|105278002
).

Skin|119325001|39937001|181469002
can
become
so hypersensitive|223528007
that patients|116154003
are
prohibited
from
having
anything
touch|386476006|52962008|397624008
certain parts|17162000|260726005
of their body,|279495008|123037004
especially
the feet.|56459004|259051005

People|125676002
with this degree|258395000|246173007
of sensitivity|35209006|365705006
cannot
have
a bedsheet|5679009
touch|386476006|52962008|397624008
their feet|56459004|259051005
or
wear socks|262156000
or
shoes,|43983001
and
eventually
become
housebound.|160689007

Motor symptoms|267082004
include|55919000
loss
of function|246464006
(negative) symptoms|260385009
of weakness,|13791008|260407003
tiredness,|84229001
heaviness,
and
gait abnormalities|22325002
;
and
_gain
of function_|246464006
(_positive_|258758003|10828004
)
symptoms
of cramps,|55300003
tremor,|26079004
and
muscle twitch|60238002
(fasciculations.|82470000

There
is
also pain|22253000
in the muscles|91727004
(myalgia,|68962001
cramps,|55300003
etc.,
and
there
may
also
be
autonomic dysfunction.|72167002|386585008

During physical examination,|5880005
specifically
a neurological examination,|84728005
those
with generalized peripheral neuropathies most commonly|60132005|42658009
have
distal sensory|46053002|262139008
or
motor
and
sensory loss,|33653009
though
those
with a pathology|394595002
(problem|55607006
)
of the nerves|3057000
may
be
perfectly normal|17621005|258744000
;
may
show
proximal weakness,|40415009|13791008|40415009|40415009|260407003
as
in some inflammatory neuropathies|21018002
like Guillain?Barr? syndrome
;
or
may
show
focal sensory disturbance|87017008|85972008
or
weakness,|13791008|260407003
such as
in mononeuropathies.|128189008

Ankle jerk reflex|271715007|60238002|271715007|87572000|271715007|106146005
is
classically absent|2667000
in peripheral neuropathy.|42658009

The causes|134198009
are
broadly
grouped|255504006
as
follows|367409002
:

Many
of the diseases|64572001
of the peripheral nervous system|3058005
may
present|52101004|246105001
similarly
to muscle problems|91727004|55607006
(myopathies,|129565002
and
so|223528007
it
is
important to
develop
approaches|103379005
for assessing
sensory|262139008
and
motor disturbances
in patients|116154003
so
that
a physician|309343006
may
make
an accurate diagnosis.|263656005|439401001|263656005

Many treatment strategies|260396001|276239002|260396001|416118004
for peripheral neuropathy|42658009
are
symptomatic.|264931009

Some current research|15240007
in animal models|387961004
has
shown
that neurotrophin-3|12915002
can
oppose
the demyelination present|32693004|52101004|32693004|246105001
in some peripheral neuropathies.[16]|42658009

A range
of drugs|410942007
that
act
on the central nervous system|21483005|278199004
such as drugs originally|410942007
intended|361269008
as antidepressants|372720008
and
antiepileptic drugs
have
been
found|404684003
to
be
useful
in managing neuropathic pain.|119270007|247398009

Commonly used treatments|394850002|276239002
include|55919000
using|260676000
a tricyclic antidepressant|373253007
(
such as amitriptyline|372726002
and
antiepileptic therapies|276239002
such as gabapentin|386845007
or
sodium valproate.|387481005

These
have
the advantage
that
besides
being
effective|255403003|254648000
in many cases|398241000|413769002
they
are
relatively low cost.|62482003|371880002

A great deal|255509001|263768009
of research
has
been
done
between 2005
and
2010
which
indicates|410535002
that synthetic cannabinoids|421921003
and
inhaled cannabis|14910006|14910006|398705004|14910006|22924007
are
effective treatments|255403003|276239002|254648000|276239002
for a range
of neuropathic disorders.|386033004|64572001

Research
has
demonstrated
that
the synthetic oral cannabinoid Nabilone|260548002|421921003|395806009
is
an effective adjunct treatment option|255403003|276239002|255403003|416118004|254648000|276239002|254648000|416118004
for neuropathic conditions,|386033004|260905004
especially
for people|125676002
who
are
resistant, intolerant,|30714006
or
allergic
to common medications.|72906007|410942007

Orally,|260548002
opiate derivatives|360204007
were
found|404684003
to
be
more effective|242762006|255403003|242762006|254648000
than cannabis|398705004|22924007
for most people.|125676002

Smoked cannabis|64197008|64197008|398705004|64197008|22924007|102407002|102407002|398705004|102407002|22924007|365981007|365981007|398705004|365981007|22924007
has
been
found|404684003
to
provide
relief|224978009
from HIV-associated sensory neuropathy.|230598008|47429007|262139008|19030005|47429007|95662005|86406008|47429007|95662005|402916007|47429007|95662005

was
also
found|404684003
to
relieve|397855004
neuropathy|386033004
associated|47429007
with CRPS type I,|128200000|258191002
spinal cord injury,|90584004
peripheral neuropathy,|42658009
and
nerve injury.[21]|57182000

Pregabalin|415160008
is
an anticonvulsant drug|255632006
used|394850002
for neuropathic pain.|247398009

It
has
also
been
found|404684003
effective|255403003|254648000
for generalized anxiety disorder.|21897009

It
was
designed
as a more potent successor|242762006|30207005
to gabapentin|386845007
but
is
significantly more expensive, especially now
that
the patent|56116003
on gabapentin|386845007
has
expired|58322009
and
gabapentin|386845007
is
available|103328004
as a generic drug.|18511007

by Pfizer
under the trade name Lyrica.|27468005

Duloxetine,|407032004
a serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor,|45555007|33635003|407034003|50880007|407034003
is
also
being
used to|394850002
reduce|260400001
neuropathic pain.|247398009

Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation therapy|229559001|18213006|229559001|258096005|229559001|276239002
may
be
effective|255403003|254648000
and
safe
in the treatment|276239002|416118004
of diabetic peripheral neuropathy.|424736006

A recent review|6493001
of three trials|421291004|110465008
involving|248448006
78 patients|116154003
found|404684003
some improvement
in pain|22253000
scores|278061009
after 4|260308009
and
6
but
not 12 weeks|258705008
of treatment,|276239002|416118004
and
an overall improvement
in neuropathic symptoms|386033004
at 12 weeks.|258705008

A second review|81170007|257997001|288495006
of four trials|421534005|110465008
found|404684003
significant improvement|386134007
in pain|22253000
and
overall symptoms,
with 38%|264670000
of patients|116154003
in one trial|421379005|110465008
becoming
asymptomatic.|84387000

The treatment|276239002|416118004
remains
effective even|255403003|254648000
after
prolonged use,|255224006|277889008|255224006|419385000
but
symptoms
return|7528007
to baseline
within a month|258706009|259036001
of treatment cessation.[23]|276239002|264657009|416118004|264657009
