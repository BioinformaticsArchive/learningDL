(Ancient Greek _?????_ _?llos_ "other"|1451003
and
_?????_ _od?n?_ "pain"|82562007|22253000|258743006|22253000
)
is
a pain|22253000
due to a stimulus|8927009
which
does
not normally
provoke|410658008
pain.|22253000

Temperature|105723007|246508008
or
physical stimuli|5880005|8927009|19388002|8927009
can
provoke|410658008
allodynia,|247404004
and
it often|70232002
occurs|272120004
after injury
to a site.|10546003

Allodynia|247404004
is
different|263735002
from hyperalgesia,|55406008
an extreme, exaggerated reaction|12565001|260377000|263851003
to a stimulus|8927009
which
is
normally painful.|22253000

There
are
different kinds|263735002|261664005
or
types|261664005
of allodynia|247404004
:

Allodynia|247404004
is
a clinical feature|58147004
of many painful conditions,|22253000|260905004
such as neuropathies,|386033004
[4] complex regional pain syndrome,|260308009|128200000
postherpetic neuralgia,|2177002
fibromyalgia,|203102006
and
migraine.|37796009

Allodynia|247404004
may
also
be
caused|23981006|134198009
by some populations|385436007
of stem cells|419758009
used|394850002
to
treat|395077000
nerve damage|57182000
including|55919000
spinal cord injury.|90584004

Static mechanical allodynia|257390007|261018001|247404004
is
a paradoxical painful hypoaesthesia,|27699000|22253000|398026008
one etiology|421379005|134198009
of which
is
lesions
of A-beta fibers.[6][7]|52095000|400293002|52095000|37202001|260989008|400293002|260989008|37202001

The cell types|4421005|246238003
involved|248448006
in nociception
and
mechanical sensation|261018001|106148006|261018001|271712005|261018001|272144002
are
the cells|4421005
responsible|394851003
for allodynia.|247404004

In healthy individuals,|263775005|125676002|263775005|385435006
nociceptors
sense|106148006
information
about cell stress|4421005|262188008|362837007|262188008
or
damage|37782003
and
temperature|105723007|246508008
at the skin|119325001|39937001|181469002
and
transmit|60117003
it
to the spinal cord.|2748008|180959008

The cell bodies|4421005|279495008|4421005|123037004|362837007|279495008|362837007|123037004
of these neurons|47220008
lie|40199007|255576009
in dorsal root ganglia,|71710004
important structures
located
on
both
sides|182353008
of the spinal cord.|2748008|180959008

The axons then|60436000
pass
through the dorsal horn to|44985000
make
connections|263538003
with secondary neurons.|2603003|47220008|81170007|47220008

The secondary neurons|2603003|47220008|81170007|47220008
cross over|35147005
to the other|74964007
(contralateral|255209002
)
side|182353008
of the spinal cord|2748008|180959008
and
reach|282679008
nuclei|84640000
of the thalamus.|42695009|244433007

From there,
the information
is
carried|288345009
through one|421379005
or
more neurons|242762006|47220008
to the somatosensory cortex|40146001
of the brain.|12738006|258335003

Mechanoreceptors
follow|367409002|421939007
the same general pathway.|262126009|60132005

However,
they
do
not cross over|35147005
at the level|258395000|276625007
of the spinal cord,|2748008|180959008
but
at the lower medulla instead.|261122009|26519002|261122009|279104005

In addition,|260364009
they
are
grouped|255504006
in tracts
that
are
spatially distinct
from the nociceptive tracts.

Despite this anatomical separation,|36298004|16640008|36298004|160788005
mechanoreceptors
can
influence
the output
of nociceptors
by making connections|263538003
with the same interneurons,|262126009
the activation
of which
can
reduce|260400001
or
completely
eliminate
the sensation|106148006|271712005|272144002
of pain.|22253000

Another way to
modulate|261019009
the transmission|258150004
of pain information|22253000
is
via descending fibers|75294000|400293002|75294000|37202001
from the brain.|12738006|258335003

These fibers|400293002|37202001
act
through different interneurons to|263735002
block|26036001|112232007
the transmission|258150004
of information
from the nociceptors
to secondary neurons.[8]|2603003|47220008|81170007|47220008

Both
of these mechanisms|257544000
for pain modulation|22253000
have
been
implicated
in the pathology|394595002
of allodynia.|247404004

Several studies|261028005|110465008|261028005|224699009
suggest
that injury
to the spinal cord|2748008|180959008
might
lead|88488004
to loss
and
re-organization|228877007|21139007
of the nociceptors,
mechanoreceptors
and
interneurons,
leading|236874000
to the transmission|258150004
of pain information|22253000
by mechanoreceptors[9][10]
A different study|263735002|110465008|263735002|224699009
reports|229059009|223458004
the appearance|386548000|255412001
of descending fibers|75294000|400293002|75294000|37202001
at the injury site.|10546003

All
of these changes ultimately|243326001|263703002
affect|4065008
the circuitry
inside the spinal cord,|2748008|180959008
and
the altered balance|249982003|78933003|282295000
of signals probably
leads|88488004|236874000
to the intense sensation|103370009|106148006|103370009|271712005|103370009|272144002
of pain|22253000
associated|47429007
with allodynia.|247404004

Different cell types|263735002|4421005|263735002|246238003
have
also
been
linked
to allodynia.|247404004

For example,
there
are
reports|229059009|223458004
that microglia|63483002
in the thalamus|42695009|244433007
might
contribute
to allodynia|247404004
by changing|243326001|263703002
the properties|370130000|116685008
of the secondary nociceptors.|2603003|81170007

The same effect|262126009|253861007
is
achieved
in the spinal cord|2748008|180959008
by the recruitment|2724004
of immune system cells|116003000|4421005
such as monocytes/macrophages|55918008|58986001|67776007|58986001
and
T lymphocytes.[13]|57184004

There
is
a strong body|260404005|279495008|260404005|123037004
of evidence|18669006
that
the so called sensitization|223528007|416167002
of the central nervous system|21483005|278199004
contributes
to the appearance|386548000|255412001
of allodynia.|247404004

Sensitization refers|416167002|439980006
to the increased response|35105006|260366006
of neurons|47220008
following|255260001
repetitive stimulation.|122545008

In addition|260364009
to repeated activity,|27582007|48761009|27582007|55561003|27582007|258745004|27582007|257733005
the increased levels|35105006|258395000|260366006|258395000
of certain compounds|17162000|62105006
lead|88488004
to sensitization,|416167002
as well.|20572008

The work|261041009
of many researchers
has
led|88488004|236874000
to the elucidation
of pathways
that
can
result|394617004
in neuronal sensitization|47220008|416167002
both
in the thalamus|42695009|244433007
and
dorsal horns.|44985000

Both
pathways
depend
on the production
of chemokines
and
other molecules|74964007|290005005
important
in the inflammatory response.

A very important molecule|260358002|290005005
in the thalamus|42695009|244433007
appears
to
be
cysteine-cysteine chemokine ligand 21 (CCL21).|5932006

The concentration|82742001
of this chemokine
is
increased|35105006|260366006
in the ventral posterolateral nucleus|7091000
of the thalamus|42695009|244433007
where secondary nociceptive neurons|2603003|47220008|81170007|47220008
make
connections|263538003
with other neurons.|74964007|47220008

The source|260753009
of CCL21
is
not exactly
known|36692007
,
but
two possibilities|420797005
exist.

First,|255216001|232714002
it
might
be
made
in primary nociceptive neurons|63161005|47220008|261424001|47220008
and
transported|57188001|360300001
up to the thalamus.|42695009|244433007

Most likely,|4757001|2931005
neurons|47220008
intrinsic|260521003|255406006
to the ventral posterolateral nucleus|7091000
make
at least
some
of it.

In any case,|398241000
CCL21
binds|257768005
to C-C chemokine receptor type 7|116647005|261664005
and
chemokine receptor CXCR3 receptors|116647005
on microglia|63483002
in the thalamus.|42695009|244433007

The physiologic response|1360005
to the binding|257768005
is
probably
the production
of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2)|387245009
by cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2).|124217000

Activated microglia|63483002
making
PGE2|387245009
can
then
sensitize
nociceptive neurons|47220008
as
manifested|250255003|249319006
by their lowered threshold|261122009|118589004|385440003|118589004
to pain.[16]|22253000

The mechanism|257544000
responsible|394851003
for sensitization|416167002
of the central nervous system|21483005|278199004
at the level|258395000|276625007
of the spinal cord|2748008|180959008
is
different|263735002
from the one|421379005
in the thalamus.|42695009|244433007

Tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF - alpha)|8612007
and
its receptor|116647005
are
the molecules|290005005
that
seem
to
be
responsible|394851003
for the sensitization|416167002
of neurons|47220008
in the dorsal horns|44985000
of the spinal cord.|2748008|180959008

Macrophages|58986001
and
lymphocytes|56972008|446325007
infiltrate|47351003
the spinal cord,|2748008|180959008
for example,
because of injury,
and
release TNF-alpha|58000006|8612007|68776005|8612007|258760001|8612007|129299003|8612007|115956009|8612007
and
other pro-inflammatory molecules.|74964007|52541003|290005005

TNF-alpha then|8612007
binds|257768005
to the TNF receptors|116647005
expressed
on nociceptors,
activating
the MAPK/NF-kappa B pathways.|260243007

This
leads|88488004|236874000
to the production
of more TNF-alpha,|242762006|8612007
its release,|58000006|68776005|258760001|129299003|115956009
and
binding|257768005
to the receptors|116647005
on the cells|4421005
that
released|68776005|129299003
it
(autocrine signalling.|38952000

This mechanism also|257544000
explains
the perpetuation
of sensitization|416167002
and
thus allodynia.|247404004

TNF-alpha|8612007
might
also
increase|260366006
the number|410680006|410681005
of AMPA receptors,|116647005
and
decrease|260400001|260370003
the numbers|410680006|410681005
of GABA receptors|259100002|116647005
on the membrane|83097008
of nociceptors,
both
of which
could
change|243326001|263703002
the nociceptors
in a way
that
allows
for their easier activation.|36203004

Another outcome|394617004
of the increased TNF-alpha|35105006|8612007|260366006|8612007
is
the release|58000006|68776005|258760001|129299003|115956009
of PGE2,|387245009
with a mechanism|257544000
and
effect|253861007
similar
to the ones|421379005
in the thalamus.[19]|42695009|244433007

As
already
mentioned
,
there
are
descending neurons|75294000|47220008
that
modulate|261019009
the perception|81742003
of pain.|22253000

Many
of these neurons|47220008
originate
in nuclei|84640000
in the brainstem|15926001|180925009
and
pass
through the periaqueductal gray (PAG) area|87286000|42798000
of the midbrain.|61962009|279099009

The body|279495008|123037004
possesses
an additional mechanism to|260364009|257544000
control|31509003
pain|22253000
:
the release|58000006|68776005|258760001|129299003|115956009
of endogenous opioids,|73979006|404642006
especially
at the level|258395000|276625007
of the PAG.

There
are
neurons|47220008
that
release|58000006|68776005|258760001|129299003|115956009
enkephalins,|61299002
endorphins,|53682000
and
dynorphins|26277008
at the PAG,
and
in this way
modulate|261019009
its ability to|371150009
modulate|261019009
pain perception.

Other neurons|74964007|47220008
can
release|58000006|68776005|258760001|129299003|115956009
their endogenous opioids|73979006|404642006
at the source|260753009
of the pain,|22253000
as well.|20572008

If
this
occurs|272120004
,
the transmission|258150004
of pain information|22253000
from the nociceptors
to the secondary neurons|2603003|47220008|81170007|47220008
is
blocked,|26036001|112232007
and
no pain|22253000
is
felt.|285854004

Unfortunately,
these endogenous mechanisms|73979006|257544000
are
often|70232002
damaged|37782003
and
nonfunctional|42044006
in people|125676002
suffering
from allodynia,|247404004
so
the application|410618006
of pharmaceuticals|421967003
is
needed.|410525008|103325001

Numerous compounds|260396001|62105006
alleviate
the pain|22253000
from allodynia.|247404004

Some
are
specific|69658003
for certain types|17162000|261664005
of allodynia|247404004
while
others|74964007
are
general.|60132005

They
include|55919000
:
[20]

The list
of compounds|62105006
that
can
be
used|394850002
to
treat|395077000
allodynia|247404004
is
even longer|255511005
than this.

For example,
many non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs,|372665008
such as naproxen,|372588000
can
inhibit|61511001
COX-1|124218005
and/or
COX-2,|29836001
thus
preventing|116699007
the sensitization|416167002
of the central nervous system.|21483005|278199004

Another effect|253861007
of naproxen|372588000
is
the reduction|58294000|260400001|289928003
of the responsiveness|80074009
of mechano-
and
thermoreceptors
to stimuli.[21]|8927009

Other compounds|74964007|62105006
act
on molecules|290005005
important
for the transmission|258150004
of an action potential|129264002|30207005
from one neuron|421379005|47220008
to another.

Examples
of these
include|55919000
interfering|78235001
with receptors|116647005

YM-230888
is
a compound|62105006
that
can
bind|257768005
to one|421379005
of the metabotropic receptors,|116647005
preventing|116699007
glutamate|430503006|104697004
from binding|257768005
and
the transmission|258150004
of the signal.

This compound|62105006
can
also
overcome
the blood?brain barrier,|20245001
allowing
it to
be
useful
in the thalamus.[22]|42695009|244433007

Endocannabinoids
are
molecules|290005005
that
can
relieve|397855004
pain|22253000
by modulating nociceptive neurons.|261019009|47220008

When
anandamide,
an endocannabinoid,
is
released,|68776005|129299003
pain sensation
is
reduced.|260400001

Anandamide
is
later
transported|57188001|360300001
back
to the neurons|47220008
releasing|129299003
it
using|260676000
transporter enzymes|90668006
on the plasma membrane,|53982002
eventually
disinhibiting
pain perception.

However,
this re-uptake|228877007|258763004
can
be
blocked|26036001|112232007
by AM404,
elongating
the duration|103335007
of pain inhibition.[23]|22253000|61511001|264657009|22253000|419495008|264657009
