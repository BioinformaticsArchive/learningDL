from Middle English _glaundres_|255562008|297487008|255562008|25804004|399488007|297487008|399488007|25804004
or
Old French _glandres_,|70753007|19434008
both
meaning glands|255586005|362884007
)
[1]|260305007
(Latin
:
_Malleus_ German|4639008|7695005|34080009|7695005|264090005|7695005
:
_Rotz_
)
(also
known|36692007
as "Equinia,
" "Farcy,|4639008
"
and
"Malleus"[2]|4639008|34080009|264090005
:

)
is
an infectious disease|191415002
that
occurs|272120004
primarily
in horses,|35354009
mules,|228236001
and
donkeys.|85626006

It
can
be
contracted|78558002
by other animals|74964007|387961004
such as dogs,|448771007
cats|448169003|388618001
and
goats.|125097000|388249000

It
is
caused|23981006|134198009
by infection
with the bacterium _Burkholderia mallei_,|409822003|113674000
usually
by ingestion|111984006
of contaminated food|228034007
or
water.|11713004|119318008

Symptoms
of glanders|4639008
include|55919000
the formation|11798007|255277001
of nodular lesions|255288007
in the lungs|39607008
and
ulceration|429040005
of the mucous membranes|313268005
in the upper respiratory tract.|58675001|361381009

The acute form|272118002|246176004
results|394617004
in coughing,|272039006
fever|386661006
and
the release|58000006|68776005|258760001|129299003|115956009
of an infectious nasal discharge,
followed|367409002
by septicaemia|105592009
and
death|419620001|268923008
within days.|258703001

In the chronic form,|90734009|246176004
nasal|260540009
and
subcutaneous nodules|95325000
develop
,
eventually ulcerating.|429040005

Death|419620001|268923008
can
occur|272120004
within months,|258706009
while
survivors
act
as carriers.|47461006

Glanders|4639008
is
endemic
in Africa,|223498002
Asia,|223500001
the Middle East,|223605000
Central|26216008
and
South America.|223504005

It
has
been
eradicated
from North America,|223503004
Australia|223621005
and
most
of Europe|223502009
through surveillance|225419007
and
destruction|64597002
of affected animals,|116689002
and
import restrictions.|263856008

_Burkholderia mallei_|113674000
is
able to|371150009
infect
humans|278412004
and
is
therefore
classed|258391009
as a zoonotic agent.|260872001

Transmission|258150004
occurs|272120004
by direct contact|255589003|11723008|255589003|70862002
with infected animals|387961004
and
entry
is
through skin abrasions,|37236007
nasal|260540009
and
oral mucosal surfaces,|113277000|410678000
or
by inhalation.|14910006|422237004

The mallein test|269814003|272393004
is
a sensitive|83185005
and
specific clinical test|69658003|58147004|269814003|69658003|58147004|69658003|58147004|272393004
for glanders.|4639008

Mallein
(ATCvet code
:
QI05AR01,
a protein fraction|88878007|278277004
of the glanders organism|4639008|410653004
(_Burkholderia mallei_|113674000
)
,
is
injected intradermo-palpebrally|422145002
or
given|419582001
by eye-drop.|385125006

In infected animals,|387961004
the eyelid swells markedly|80243003|423666004|46998006|265782007|423666004|46998006
in 1|260305007
or
2 days.|260306008|258703001

Glanders|4639008
has
not
been
reported|229059009|223458004
in the United States since 1945.|223688001

Due to the high mortality rate|75540009|409651001|371879000|409651001
in humans|278412004
and
the small number|255507004|410680006|255507004|410681005
of organisms|410653004
required
to
establish|263748003
infection,
_Burkholderia mallei_|113674000
is
regarded
as a potential biological warfare (BW)|30207005|12893009
or
bioterrorism agent,|260872001
as is
the closely related organism,|272151006|410653004|262094002|410653004
_Burkholderia pseudomallei_,|116399000
the causative agent|362944004
of melioidosis.|428111003

During World War I,|42146005|22971001
Glanders|4639008
was
believed
to
have
been
spread|410677005
deliberately
by German agents to|7695005|260872001
infect
large numbers|255509001|410680006|255509001|410681005
of Russian horses|297514005|35354009|85163001|35354009
and
mules|228236001
on the Eastern Front.|255549009

Other agents|74964007|260872001
attempted
to
introduce|127487003
the disease|64572001
in the United States|223688001
and
Argentina.|223713009

This
had
an effect|253861007
on troop
and
supply convoys|425398004
as well as
on artillery movement,|255324009
which
were
dependent|371154000
on horses|35354009
and
mules.|228236001

Human cases|278412004|398241000|278412004|413769002
in Russia|223656009
increased|35105006|260366006
with the infections
during
and
after WWI.

The Japanese deliberately infected horses,|414551003|35354009
civilians,
and
prisoners
of war
with _B.

at the Pinfang
(China|223581004
)
Institute|385437003
during World War II.

The U.S.|223688001

studied|110465008|224699009
this agent|260872001
as a possible BW weapon|371930009|223547005|312201009|60022001|223547005|312201009
in 1943?44
but
did
not
weaponize
it.

U.S.|223688001

interest|225469004
in Glanders|4639008
(Agent LA)|260872001
continued|255238004
through the 1950s,
except it
had
an inexplicable tendency to
lose
virulence
in the lab,|261904005
making
it difficult to|52925006
weaponize.

The Soviet Union
is
also
believed
to
have
been
interested|225469004
in _B.

mallei_|4639008|34080009|264090005
as a potential BW agent|30207005|223547005|260872001
after World War II.

There currently|15240007
is
no vaccine|398827000
licensed
for use|277889008|419385000
in the
US.

Infection
with either
of these bacteria|409822003
presents|52101004|246105001
with nonspecific symptoms|10003008
and
can
be
either
acute|272118002
or
chronic,|90734009
impeding
rapid diagnosis.|255358001|439401001|255358001

The lack|41277001
of a vaccine|398827000
for
either
bacterium also|409822003
makes
them potential candidates|30207005
for bioweaponization.

Together with their high rate|75540009|371879000
of infectivity
via aerosols|64242006|52262001
and
resistance|30714006
to many common antibiotics,|72906007|255631004
both
bacteria|409822003
have
been
classified|73504009
as category B priority pathogens|260870009|264418008
by the
US NIH
and
US CDC,
which
has
spurred|49620009
a dramatic increase|260366006
in interest|225469004
in these microorganisms.|264395009

Attempts
have
been
made
to
develop
vaccines|398827000
for these infections,
which
would
not only
benefit
military personnel,|302314004
a group most likely to|261586004|2931005|160481000|2931005|389109008|2931005
be
targeted
in an intentional release,|361269008|58000006|361269008|68776005|361269008|258760001|361269008|129299003|361269008|115956009
but
also individuals|125676002|385435006
who
may
come
in contact|52101004|11723008|52101004|70862002|18720000|11723008|18720000|70862002
with glanders-infected animals|4639008|387961004
or
live|419749002
in areas|42798000
where melioidosis|428111003
is
endemic.
