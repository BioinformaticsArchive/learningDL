The physical features|5880005|19388002
of ulegyria|56531003
consist
of small radial scars|255507004|133855003
which
occupy
the cortical sulci.|68594002|40146001|50403003

Overall,
the physical structure|5880005|19388002
of affected areas|247591002|42798000|248448006|42798000
in the brain|12738006|258335003
is
described
as a ?mushroom?-like shape|106562006|107644003|106562006|246176004|106562006|300842002|227252000|107644003|227252000|246176004|227252000|300842002
in which
the gyri
are
unusually large|255509001
and
the sulci
become
wider deeper|90522003|131197000
in the cortex .|40146001

This structure
is
the result|394617004
of the lower parts|261122009|260726005
of the ulegyria-affected area|56531003|247591002|42798000|56531003|248448006|42798000
being
more prone|242762006|1240000
to deterioration,
while
the upper gyri|261183002
are
usually
spared.

However,
the entire affected area shrinks|255503000|247591002|42798000|255503000|248448006|42798000|260232004|247591002|42798000|260232004|248448006|42798000
and
presents|52101004|246105001
brown coloration|371254008
as a result|394617004
of ulegyria.|56531003

In addition,|260364009
?islands?|288560006
of neurons|47220008
that
are
relatively
unaffected
can
exist
between ulegyria-affected neurons.|56531003|247591002|47220008|56531003|248448006|47220008

Ulegyria|56531003
can
develop
bilaterally
or
unilaterally,
though
the former|9130008
is
more commonly|242762006
diagnosed.[6]|439401001

Ulegyria|56531003
can
affect|4065008
many parts|260726005
of the brain|12738006|258335003
including|55919000
the cerebral cortex,|40146001
parasagittal areas|103343002|42798000
and
posterior regions|255551008|410673009
of the brain,|12738006|258335003
such as the parietal|263832009
and
occipital lobes.|31065004

These areas|42798000
are
situated
either
near artery rich regions|277752003|51114001|224166006|410673009|277752003|11527006|224166006|410673009
or
near a major cerebral artery.|255603008|88556005|255603008|181308008

For instance,
specifically
in neonatal children,|255407002|410601007|255407002|160499008
ulegyria-affected areas|56531003|247591002|42798000|56531003|248448006|42798000
are
found|404684003
near the posterior cerebral artery|70382005|181313007
or
near the artery rich region|51114001|224166006|410673009|11527006|224166006|410673009
between the middle|255562008|399488007
and
posterior regions|255551008|410673009
of the brain,|12738006|258335003
often|70232002
referred to|439980006
as
watershed regions.[1][4][7]|410673009

Neurons|47220008
affected|247591002|248448006
by ulegyria exhibit properties|56531003|370130000|56531003|116685008
that
differ
than normally functioning neurons.|246464006|47220008

For instance,
neurons|47220008
experience
gliosis,|81415000
in which glial cells,|2156000
specifically astrocytes,|78399007
build up|255532002|353734004
near|277752003
and
around neurons.|47220008

Ulegyria-affected neurons also|56531003|247591002|47220008|56531003|248448006|47220008
display
decreases|260370003
in their white matter content,|413773004|276824008|185984009|276824008|371251000|276824008
showing
signs|72670004
of sclerosis,|43846000
which
is
characterized
by the deterioration
of myelin|79612000|23879005
in neurons.|47220008

However,
in regions|410673009
of grey matter,
large dense aggregates|255509001|255596001|18403000
of myelin|79612000|23879005
are
present.|52101004|246105001

Ulegyria-affected neurons also|56531003|247591002|47220008|56531003|248448006|47220008
display
metabolic disorders|30390004
which
could
be
linked
to the disease phenylketonuria|64572001|64572001|7573000
and
disruptions|76555007
in the urea cycle.|387092000|44180009

Hypoglycemia|271327008
and
hypoxia|389086002
are
also
thought|88952004
to
accompany
the symptoms
of ulegyria-affected neurons|56531003|247591002|47220008|56531003|248448006|47220008
as well.[2][9]|20572008

Ulegyria|56531003
develops
as a result|394617004
of a brain injury|2470005
called
cerebral ischemia|432504007|287731003
surrounding|355648006
the time|410669006
of an infant?s birth.|418119000|3950001

A lack|41277001
of oxygen|24099007
to the brain|12738006|258335003
contributes
to the formation|11798007|255277001
of lesions usually
near the three main cerebral arteries,|421291004|63161005|88556005
located
near the parietal lobe|16630005|180922007
and
occipital lobes|31065004
of the brain.|12738006|258335003

The cause|134198009
of perinatal brain injuries|371578004|2470005
includes|55919000
:

Some risk factors|80943009
for perinatal brain injuries|371578004|2470005
include|55919000
:
low birth weight, preterm birth,|276610007|282020008
poor perinatal cardiorespiratory fitness,|11403006|371578004|11403006|371578004|91175000|11403006|371578004|102499006|255351007|371578004|255351007|371578004|91175000|255351007|371578004|102499006
and
artificial ventilation.[11]|40617009

Cerebral ischemia|432504007|287731003
occurs|272120004
when
the brain|12738006|258335003
is
not
receiving
adequate oxygen to|51117008|24099007|88323005|24099007
continue|255238004
normal functions.|17621005|246464006|258744000|246464006

When
this
occurs|272120004
,
the body|279495008|123037004
makes
restoring oxygenated blood flow|58190003
to life-sustaining organs|224130005|263892007|410653004
a priority.|260870009

The brain|12738006|258335003
alters
the diameter|81827009
of major blood vessels to|255603008|59820001
redistribute
blood|87612001|119273009
to key organs|410653004
such as the brain,|12738006|258335003
heart,|80891009|302509004
and
adrenal glands.|23451007

If sympathetic nervous system activation|68365008|362484004
does
not
produce
any improvement,
oxygen levels|24099007|258395000
will
continue|255238004
to
fall|1912002
and
disruptions|76555007
to metabolism,|47722004
other cellular processes,|74964007|30545007
and
overall functioning|246464006
will
ensue.

Another serious result|42745003|394617004
of inefficient blood flow|260381000|58190003
is
that cells|4421005
do
not
receive
adequate amounts|51117008|107651007|88323005|107651007
of glucose.|67079006|72191006

An immediate effect|88694003|253861007|49499008|253861007
of low intracellular glucose|62482003|83167003|67079006|62482003|83167003|72191006|371880002|83167003|67079006|371880002|83167003|72191006
is
a reduction|58294000|260400001|289928003
in the amount|107651007
of ATP
produced
by the cell.|4421005|362837007

This effectively
inactivates
the Na-K pump,|385432009|44668000
leading|236874000
to the uptake|258763004
of calcium ions|5540006|48006008
by the cell.|4421005|362837007

Continued influx|255238004
of calcium|5540006
serves
to constitutively
activate
downstream effectors,|103365002
including|55919000
lipases,|72993008
proteases,|130202003|116536008
and
endonucleases,
whose actions eventually destroy|129264002
the cell skeleton.|4421005|113192009|4421005|361378004|362837007|113192009|362837007|361378004

Intracellular calcium concentrations|83167003|5540006|82742001
are
increased|35105006|260366006
further|46053002
due to the opening|56116003
of glutamate-regulated ion channels.|430503006|48006008|255592004|104697004|48006008|255592004

Ischemia|52674009
causes|134198009
anoxic cell depolarizations|29658002|4421005|29658002|362837007
and
it
is
this increase|260366006
in membrane potential|83097008|30207005
at the presynaptic cell|4421005|362837007
that
triggers
the release|58000006|68776005|258760001|129299003|115956009
of the excitatory neurotransmitter,|35069000
glutamate.[12]|430503006|104697004

Glucose deprivation|67079006|72191006
in the brain|12738006|258335003
for any amount|107651007
of time|410669006
has
the potential to|30207005
pose
serious consequences,|42745003|103332005
and
the amount|107651007
of time|410669006
the brain|12738006|258335003
spends
under these anoxic conditions|29658002|260905004
is
directly
related|272151006|262094002
to accumulation
of irreversible damage|37782003
to protein biosynthesis pathways.|88878007|11798007

Protein synthesis|88878007|11798007
all over the body|279495008|123037004
is
severely|24484000
inhibited|61511001
and
essentially
comes
to a standstill
while
the brain|12738006|258335003
is
suffering
from acute oxygen deprivation.|272118002|24099007

Once oxygen sufficiently|24099007
saturates|103401005
the tissues again,|85756007
protein biosynthesis returns|88878007|11798007|7528007
to normal|17621005|258744000
in non-vulnerable areas|42798000
but
remains
at
below normal levels|17621005|258395000|258744000|258395000
in other areas.|74964007|42798000

Insufficient protein synthesis|71978007|88878007|11798007|423437008|88878007|11798007
in the brain|12738006|258335003
is
especially troubling
in the fetal brain|256860004
given|419582001
the amount|107651007
of growth
and
development|278923009
that normally
occurs.|272120004

Vulnerable areas|42798000
where protein synthesis|88878007|11798007
is
interrupted usually|261017006
indicate|410535002
cell death|4421005|419620001|4421005|268923008|362837007|419620001|362837007|268923008
in neurons|47220008
in the near future.|277752003

When
oxygen levels|24099007|258395000
return|7528007
,
oxygen radicals,|24099007|32948009
nitric oxide|409378005
and
an imbalance
of neurotransmitters|35069000
cause|23981006|134198009
further damage|46053002|37782003
and
lead|88488004
to cellular death|4421005|419620001|4421005|268923008
through apoptosis.|20663007

Neuron cell death|47220008|4421005|419620001|47220008|4421005|268923008|47220008|362837007|419620001|47220008|362837007|268923008
is
responsible|394851003
for gliosis|81415000
and
the resulting mushroom appearance|42752001|106562006|386548000|42752001|106562006|255412001|42752001|227252000|386548000|42752001|227252000|255412001
of areas|42798000
characteristic
of ulegyria.[12]|56531003

A Cerebral hemorrhage|73020009|274100004
is
the result|394617004
of immature blood vessels|1090009|59820001
of a brain lesion bursting.|301766008|255331008

The germinal matrix
is
a part|260726005
of the brain|12738006|258335003
that normally
disappears
as the fetal brain|256860004
develops
but
during this process|415178003
it
is
not unusual
for changes in vessel volume to|243326001|59820001|118565006|243326001|59820001|419569009|263703002|59820001|118565006|263703002|59820001|419569009
cause|23981006|134198009
the vessel to|59820001
burst.|255331008

According to recent microscopic studies,|6493001|84496004|110465008|6493001|84496004|224699009
the most common location|4757001|72906007|246267002
is
where the medullary veins drain|38254008|29092000|32712000|26519002|29092000|32712000
to the terminal vein|42796001|29092000|42796001|181367001
in the sub-ependymal region.|261089000|12766003|410673009|118555000|12766003|410673009

It
has
been
hypothesized
that
because
pre-term babies|236874000|418119000|272113006|418119000
don?t
have
fully
developed
sympathetic nervous systems,|68365008
they
cannot
react
as well|20572008
to low oxygen saturation levels|62482003|24099007|103401005|258395000|371880002|24099007|103401005|258395000
in this case|398241000
due to cerebral hemorrhage.|73020009|274100004

Although
babies|418119000
born|106970005|81827009|398209006
at full-term|261015003
are
still susceptible|131196009
to this,
they
are
likely to|2931005
enact
a better response|3442003
and
thus,
tend
to
have
better outcomes|3442003|394617004
in response
to low-oxygen events.|62482003|24099007|272379006|371880002|24099007|272379006

Recent research|6493001
has
found|404684003
a connection|263538003
between intrauterine infections|398236008
and
inflammation|257552002
in the mother|72705000
and
an increased likelihood|35105006|2931005|260366006|2931005
of perinatal brain damage|371578004|2470005
in the fetus.|83418008

This study|110465008|224699009
suggested
that intrauterine infections|398236008
in the mother|72705000
could
affect|4065008
glial cells|2156000
and
toll-like receptors (TLRs)|116647005
which
are
important
in moderating|6736007
the inflammatory response
in the fetal brain.|256860004

When
glial cells|2156000
and
TLRs
are
affected|247591002|248448006
than they
are
not able to|371150009
react
to developing inflammation|257552002
in the brain.|12738006|258335003

Ulegyria|56531003
is
often|70232002
confused|286933003
with a similar distortion|20967005
of the cortex|40146001
known|36692007
as polymicrogyria.

Polymicrogyria
is
characterized
by excessive folding|260378005|10942006
of the surface gyri|410678000
and
a thickening|263899003
of the cerebral cortex,|40146001
[14]
rather than
the sulcal scarring|275322007
that
is
typical
of ulegyria.|56531003

In additional|260364009
to morphological differences,|116676008|263735002|72724002|263735002
the period|259037005
in which polmicrogyria
and
ulegyria|56531003
emerge
also
differs.

Polymicrogyria typically
form|246176004
while
the embryo's central nervous system|57991002|21483005|57991002|278199004
is
maturing.|34071009

Ulegyria|56531003
is
acquired later|255396000
in development|278923009
during the perinatal period|371578004
after neuronal migration|47220008|74118003
has
already
occurred.|272120004

It
is
also
suspected|415684004
that polymicrogyra
is
genetically
linked
,
whereas
ulegyria|56531003
is
caused|23981006|134198009
by environmental factors?namely|102487004
lack|41277001
of oxygen.[1]|24099007

Polymicrogyria
can
lead|88488004
to similar conditions|260905004
that
are
linked
to ulegyria|56531003
such as mental retardation,|91138005
cerebral palsy,|128188000
and
epilepsy.|313307000

It
has
been
observed
that patients|116154003
with polymicrogyria
are
not receptive
to epilepsy surgery.|313307000|83578000

However,
responses
of patients|116154003
with ulegyria|56531003
to similar surgeries|83578000
are
still
not fully
known|36692007
,
which
makes
distinction
of these two disorders|420797005|64572001
significant.|386134007

In vivo neuroimaging techniques,|272394005
namely MRI,|113091000
have
been
instrumental
in making
this distinction.

An MRI image|113091000
of ulegyria|56531003
is
identified|7882003
by mushroom shaped gyri,|106562006|107644003|106562006|300842002|227252000|107644003|227252000|300842002
deformities|276654001
in white matter,|413773004|185984009|371251000
and
localization mainly|257880008
in the posterior cerebral region.|255551008|410673009

Polymicrogyria
is
typically
recognized
by a scalloped appearance|61430003|386548000|61430003|255412001|227162004|386548000|227162004|255412001
at the bordering region|223932007
between grey|229029004|371253002
and
white matter.|413773004|185984009|371251000

Although
these distinctions
have
been
made
with many patients,|116154003
there
is
still
some difficulty|371157007
in defining distinct boundaries
between these two similar conditions.[7]|420797005|260905004

Ulegyria|56531003
was
associated|47429007
with 1/3|260305007
of the patients|116154003
with defects|6920004
caused|23981006|134198009
by circulatory disease|413854007|64572001
in the perinatal period.|371578004

Most clinical observations|4757001|58147004|103705002
of the condition|260905004
report|229059009|223458004
mental retardation,|91138005
cerebral palsy,|128188000
and
seizures|91175000
as the main defects[1][6][8][16][17] however milder cases|63161005|6920004|255604002|398241000|63161005|6920004|255604002|413769002
have
been
reported.|229059009|223458004

The main movement disorders|63161005|60342002
associated|47429007
with ulegyria|56531003
that
are
classified|73504009
as cerebral palsy|128188000
are
choreoathetosis,|43105007
dystonia,|15802004
and
ataxia.|20262006

It
is
suspected|415684004
that ulegyria|56531003
leads|88488004|236874000
to epilepsy|313307000
because
the malformation|276654001
of the cortex|40146001
obstructs|263821009
the differentiation
of neurons,|47220008
glial cells,|2156000
and
synapses.|69147006

Parietal-occipital lobe epilepsy,|230403005
which
is
often synonymous|70232002
with posterior cortex epilepsy (PCE),|255551008|40146001|313307000
[17]
is
the form|246176004
of the disease|64572001
seen
with most cases|398241000|413769002
involving|248448006
ulegyria.|56531003

This type|261664005
of epilepsy|313307000
is
very rare,|260358002|84638005|260358002|103356009
making
up about 5%
of all
reports|229059009|223458004
of epilepsy.|313307000

This form|246176004
of the disease|64572001
involves|248448006
symptoms
that
would
be
expected
from damage|37782003
to the parietal|263832009
and
occipital lobes|31065004
:
seizures|91175000
with visual hallucinations,|64269007
tingling,|162249002
numbness,|398026008|44077006
pain,|22253000
and
a burning sensation.|90673000

In addition|260364009
to ulegyria,|56531003
tumors|108369006
and
cortical dysplasia|253153000
constitute
the major causes|255603008|134198009
of PCE.

Most
of the epilepsy|313307000
seen
in conjunction with ulegyria|56531003
is
classified|73504009
as medically refractory,|20646008
meaning|255586005
it
is
not responsive|422768004
to treatment.[7]|276239002|416118004

Primarily,
the main method|63161005|260686004|63161005|272394005
of screening|20135006
for ulegyria|56531003
is
through the use|277889008|419385000
of MRI screening|113091000|20135006
for epilepsy.|313307000

There
are
three main criteria|421291004|63161005
for diagnosing ulegyria|439401001|56531003
using|260676000
MRI|113091000
:
[4]|260308009

Another sign|72670004
of ulegyria|56531003
that
is
visible|24054004
on an MRI scan|113091000|373205008|113091000
is
the presence|386397008
of a widened subarachnoid space,|90522003|35951006
signifying
an atrophying cortex.|13331008|40146001

FLAIR signaling|38952000
can
help
visualize|255374006
the depths|131197000
of the parietal-occipital sulci,|263832009
which also
allows
ulegyria-affected gyri to|56531003|247591002|56531003|248448006
be
identified.|7882003

Though
there
is
still confusion|286933003
in differentiating ulegyria|263933003|56531003
and
polymicrogyria
in patients,|116154003
MRI|113091000
allows
for the proper identification|286672002|7882003
in most cases.|398241000|413769002

Additionally,
MRI|113091000
can
diagnose|439401001
whether ulegyria presence|56531003|386397008
is
unilateral|66459002
or
bilateral.|51440002

Electroencephalography,|54550000
EEG,|54550000
can
also
be
used|394850002
to
screen|20135006|360156006
for ulegyria,|56531003
though
MRI|113091000
is
still
preferred.|225773000

This
is
mainly
done
for epilepsy patients|313307000|116154003
as abnormalities|276654001
in EEG recordings|54550000
indicate|410535002
the presence|386397008
of ulegyria|56531003
in the area|42798000
of the brain|12738006|258335003
being
tested.|272393004

For example,
when
EEG|54550000
tests|269814003|272393004
in epileptic patients|313307000|116154003
show
deviations|263739008|40885006
in the frontal|81654009
and
central-parietal regions,|223933002|263832009
ulegyria|56531003
can
be
considered
to
be
present|52101004|246105001
in
that area.[7]|42798000
