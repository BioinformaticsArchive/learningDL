*rhabdomyosarcoma|302847003
*
*
is
a type|261664005
of cancer,|363346000|372087000
specifically
a sarcoma|424952003
(cancer|363346000|372087000
of connective tissues,|181769001
in which
the cancer cells|88400008
are
thought|88952004
to
arise|68727004
from skeletal muscle progenitors.|127954009|244716004

It
can
also
be
found|404684003
attached|102491009
to muscle tissue,|91727004
wrapped|262318008
around intestines,|261093006
or
in any anatomic location.|36298004|246267002

Most
occur|272120004
in areas naturally|42798000
lacking|41277001
in skeletal muscle,|127954009|244716004
such as the head,|69536005|302548004
neck,|45048000|302550007
and
genitourinary tract.|21514008|361105006

Its two most common forms|420797005|72906007|246176004
are
embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma|404051002
and
alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma.|404053004

In the former,|9130008
which
is
more common|242762006|72906007
in younger children,|74489007
the cancer cells|88400008
resemble
those
of a typical 6-to-8-week embryo.|258705008|57991002|259038000|57991002

In the latter,
which
is
more common|242762006|72906007
in older children|31114009
and
teenagers,|133937008
they
resemble
those
of a typical 10-to-12-week embryo.|258705008|57991002|259038000|57991002

Rhabdomyosarcoma|302847003
is
a relatively rare form|84638005|246176004|103356009|246176004
of cancer.|363346000|372087000

It
is
most common|4757001|72906007
in children|410601007|160499008
ages|424144002|105436006|248280005
one to five,|421379005|421820001
and
is
also
found|404684003
in teens|133937008
aged|424144002|105436006
15
to 19,
although
this
is
more rare.|242762006|84638005|242762006|103356009

This cancer|363346000|372087000
is
also
an adult cancer|133936004|363346000|133936004|372087000
but
it
is
rare.|84638005|103356009

[St.

Jude Children's Research Hospital]|82242000
(/wiki/St._Jude_Children%27s_Research_Hospital|82242000
)
reports|229059009|223458004
that rhabdomyosarcoma|302847003
is
the most common soft tissue sarcoma|4757001|72906007|424952003
in children.|410601007|160499008

Soft tissue sarcomas make up about 3%|424952003|255532002|424952003|353734004
of childhood cancers.|68433009|363346000

The diagnosis|439401001
of rhabdomyosarcoma|302847003
is
made
by a pathologist,|61207006
he
or
she
will
examine|64049009
a biopsy|86273004
of the tumor|108369006
under the microscope|65473004
and
arrive
at the diagnosis|439401001
of rhabdomyosarcoma|302847003
based|418836005
on the morphology|116676008|72724002
(appearance|386548000|255412001
)
of the tumor cells|252987004
and
the results|394617004
of immunohistochemical stains.|397165007|127790008

Diagnosis|439401001
of rhabdomyosarcoma|302847003
depends
on recognition|312020002
of differentiation
toward skeletal muscle cells.|80985008

The proteins _myoD1_|88878007
and
_myogenin_
are
transcription factor proteins normally|10589004|88878007
found|404684003
in developing skeletal muscle cells|80985008
which
disappears
after the muscle matures|91727004|34071009
and
becomes
innervated
by a nerve.|3057000|256864008

Thus,
myoD1
and
myogenin
are
not usually
found|404684003
in normal skeletal muscle|17621005|127954009|17621005|244716004|258744000|127954009|258744000|244716004
and
serve
as a useful immunohistochemical marker
of rhabdomyosarcoma.|302847003

Early manifestation|264499004|250255003|264499004|251190009
can
be
misdiagnosed
as a pseudotumor|49293007
that
is
non responsive|80074009
to steroid treatment.|297279009

Several different histological subtypes|261028005|263735002|67151002|260837004
of rhabdomyosarcoma|302847003
exist
,
each
of which
has
different clinical|263735002|58147004
and
pathological characteristics.|394595002|29458008

Prognosis|20481000
and
clinical behavior|58147004|844005
of the tumor|108369006
is
also partially dependent|371154000
on histologic subtype.|67151002|260837004

Multiple classification systems|260396001|73504009
have
been
proposed
for subclassifying
these tumors.|108369006

The most recent classification system,|4757001|6493001|73504009
the "International Classification|73504009
of Rhabdomyosarcoma",|302847003
was
created
by the Intergroup Rhabdomyosarcoma Study.|302847003|110465008|302847003|224699009

This system|246333005
attempts
to combined elements|89780004|57795002
of the previous systems|9130008|246333005
and
correlate
these
with prognosis|20481000
based|418836005
on tumor type.|108369006|261664005

*
*International Classification|73504009
of Rhabdomyosarcoma|302847003
*
*

Several additional subtypes|261028005|260364009|260837004
of rhabdomyosarcoma|302847003
exist
that
do
not
fit|91175000|102499006
into the International Classification scheme.|73504009

Pleomorphic rhabdomyosarcoma usually|404054005
occurs|272120004
in adults|133936004
rather than
children,|410601007|160499008
and
,
thus,
is
not
included|55919000
in this system.|246333005

Sclerosing rhabdomyosarcoma|43846000|302847003
is
a rare rhabdomyosarcoma subtype recently|84638005|302847003|260837004|6493001|103356009|302847003|260837004|6493001
characterized
by Folpe,
_
et
al._
;
it
is
not
included|55919000
in this system.|246333005

Although
botryoid
and
spindle cell rhabdomyosarcoma|404055006
are
classically
considered
as subtypes|260837004
of embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma,|404051002
they
have
more favorable clinical behavior|242762006|58147004|844005
and
prognosis|20481000
than classic embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma.|255301002|404051002|255333006|404051002

Treatment|276239002|416118004
for rhabdomyosarcoma|302847003
consists
of chemotherapy,|416608005|367336001
radiation therapy|108290001
and
sometimes surgery.|83578000

Surgery to|83578000
remove|127485006
the tumor|108369006
may
be
difficult|52925006
or
impossible
depending
on the location|246267002
of the tumor.|108369006

If there
is
no evidence|18669006
of metastasis,|128462008
surgery|83578000
combined|89780004
with chemotherapy|416608005|367336001
and
radiation|30821001|82107009|108290001
offers|410527000
the best prognosis.|20481000

Patients|116154003
whose tumors|108369006
have
not
metastasized
usually
have
a good chance|20572008
for long-term survival,
depending
on the subtype|260837004
of the tumor.|108369006

St Jude's Children's Research Hospital|82242000
reports|229059009|223458004
that more|242762006
than 70%
of children|410601007|160499008
diagnosed|439401001
with localized rhabdomyosarcoma|255471002|302847003
have
long-term survival.

A study|110465008|224699009
has
shown
a link
between RMS|21984008
and
Tungsten alloy|26194003|56427006
embedded
in muscle|91727004
(e.g.|258795003

shrapnel|102342004
).

[2] However,|260306008
the tungsten alloy|26194003|56427006
contained|42504009
6% Nickel,|33396006
which
is
a known carcinogen.|36692007|88376000

A synergistic effect|253861007
of alloying tungsten|56427006|26194003
with Ni
is
suggested
(i.e.|42146005|22971001

increasing|260369004
the toxicity
relative|125677006|29920004
to either
of the pure metals|425620007
).

Rhabdomyosarcoma|302847003
in children|410601007|160499008
has
been
associated|47429007
with maternal marijuana smoking.[3]|72705000|365981007|72705000|398705004|365981007|72705000|228998006|365981007|72705000|10083006|365981007
