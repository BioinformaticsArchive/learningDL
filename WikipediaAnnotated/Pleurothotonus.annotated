Pisa syndrome
is
predominantly
caused|23981006|134198009
by a prolonged administration|255224006|413454004|255224006|416118004
or
an overly dosed administration|277406006|413454004|277406006|416118004|408102007|413454004|408102007|416118004
of antipsychotic drugs.|372482001

Although
antipsychotic drugs|372482001
are
known|36692007
to
be
the main drugs|63161005|410942007
that
are
concerned
with this syndrome,
several other drugs|261028005|410942007
are
reported|229059009|223458004
to
have
caused|23981006|134198009
the syndrome
as well.|20572008

Certain antidepressants,|17162000|372720008
psychoactive drugs,|418183005
and
antiemetics|372764000
have
also
been
found|404684003
to
cause|23981006|134198009
Pisa syndrome
in patients.[4]|116154003

Based|418836005
on the drugs|410942007
that caused Pisa syndrome,|23981006|134198009
it
has
been
implicated
that
the syndrome
may
be
due to a dopaminergic-cholinergic imbalance|16257000
or
a serotonergic
or
noradrenergic dysfunction.|386585008

For the development|278923009
of Pisa syndrome
that
cannot
be
alleviated
by anticholinergic drugs,|373246003
it
has
been
considered
that asymmetric brain functions|4128009|12738006|246464006|4128009|258335003|246464006
or
neural transmission|55859003
may
be
the underlying mechanism.|257544000

How
these drugs|410942007
interact
with the biochemistry
of the brain to|12738006|258335003
cause|23981006|134198009
the syndrome
is
unknown|261665006
and
a topic|359540000
of current research.|15240007

Typically,
females|248152002
and
older patients|70753007|116154003
with organic brain changes|12738006|243326001|12738006|263703002|258335003|243326001|258335003|263703002
are
more likely to|242762006|2931005
develop
Pisa syndrome.

Organic brain changes|12738006|243326001|12738006|263703002|258335003|243326001|258335003|263703002
are
physical changes|5880005|243326001|5880005|263703002|19388002|243326001|19388002|263703002
in the brain|12738006|258335003
which
lead|88488004
to neurological dysfunction,|1199008|386585008
including|55919000
dementia|12348006|52448006
and
frontal lobe syndrome.|129606007

This
includes|55919000
the presence|386397008
of neurodegenerative illnesses|39104002
such as Alzheimer's Disease|26929004
and
Parkinson's Disease.[6]|49049000

The predominant symptom
of Pisa syndrome
is
dystonia.|15802004

Dystonia|15802004
is
a neurological movement disorder|118940003|255324009|1199008|60342002
characterized
by sustained muscle contraction|263892007|12140005
leading|236874000
to abnormal posture,|43029002
twisting|51795009|129256008
,
and
repetitive movement.|255324009

In Pisa Syndrome specifically there
is
commonly
a tonic flexion|9964006
of the trunk|22943007|262225004
of the body|279495008|123037004
to one side,|66459002
leading|236874000
to a slight lean|255510006|255604002
(reminiscent
of the Leaning Tower
of Pisa,
hence
the name "Pisa syndrome"|239132009
).

This
is
usually
associated|47429007
with a backward axial rotation|255539006|24422004|70433009|312004007|24422004|70433009
of the spine|421060004|44300000|243930007
and
indifferent to markedly abnormal posture.|54328002|46998006|43029002

Patients|116154003
diagnosed|439401001
with Pisa Syndrome usually
experience
either
acute dystonia|272118002|272118002|15802004
or
tardive dystonia,|49386006
also
known|36692007
as tardive dyskinesia.|49386006|102449007

Differential diagnosis|47965005
between the two|420797005
may
be
hard to|72505002
accomplish
without a complete patient history,|255594003|116154003|255594003|116154003|392521001
since
both
types|261664005
of dystonia|15802004
may
occur|272120004
simultaneously|79970003
in a patient.|116154003

These symptoms generally
disappear
after discontinuation|278308006|410546004
of the antipsychotic drug.|372482001

The time|410669006
of onset|77374008
of symptoms
may
vary
depending
on drug|410942007
being
administered|418283001
and
the neurological characteristics|1199008
of the patient|116154003
in question.[2]|42425007

Acute dystonia nearly always|272118002|272118002|15802004
develops
a few weeks|57176003|258705008
after a dopamine blocking agent/medication|412383006|2899008|410942007|412383006|112232007|410942007
has
begun|255395001
or
a substantial increase|260366006
in antipsychotic dosage.|372482001|277406006

An acute dystonic reaction|272118002|263851003
consists
of sustained, painful muscular spasms,|263892007|22253000|45352006
producing
twisting|51795009|129256008
of the trunk/body|22943007
and
abnormal posture.|43029002

The most frequent occurrences|4757001|70232002|272120004
of these spasms|45352006
have
been
reported|229059009|223458004
in the neck,|45048000|302550007
tongue,|21974007|181226008
and
jaw.|661005|181811001

Oculogyric crisis|5332004
and
opisthotonus|8652009
are
also very common.|260358002|72906007

Acute effects|272118002|253861007
of dopamine antagonists also|412383006|58516001|32779004|58516001
include|55919000
Parkinsons-
like symptoms,
manifested|250255003|249319006
by bradykinesia,|399317006
pill rolling tremor,|112108005
and
rigidity|16046003
of the body.|279495008|123037004

These movements|255324009
may
fluctuate|255341006
over hours|258702006
and
temporarily
dissipate
in response
to reassurance,|79441000
and
the individual episodes|125676002|272128006|385435006|272128006
may
last
minutes|258701004|255507004|356624006
to hours.|258702006

Acute reactions|272118002|263851003
are
more common|242762006|72906007
in older patients|70753007|116154003
and
females.|248152002

The pathophysiology|386585008
underlying|255546002
these reactions|263851003
is
unknown|261665006
,
but
the movements usually|255324009
occur|272120004
during the period|259037005
when
blood medication level|87612001|410942007|258395000|87612001|410942007|276625007|119273009|410942007|258395000|119273009|410942007|276625007
is
dropping.|426684005|404218003

The acute syndromes|272118002
which
occur|272120004
due to prolonged exposure|255224006|71677004|255224006|24932003
to a dopamine antagonist|412383006|58516001|32779004|58516001
are
collectively
termed
extrapyramidal symptoms,|43378000
EPS.

Tardive dyskinesias|49386006|102449007
are
involuntary movements|162227008
of the lips,|261114002
tongue,|21974007|181226008
face,|89545001|302549007
trunk,|22943007|262225004
and
extremities|66019005|2592007
which
occur|272120004
in patients|116154003
with prolonged exposure|255224006|71677004|255224006|24932003
to dopamine antagonists|412383006|58516001|32779004|58516001
or
antipsychotic medications.|372482001|410942007

Clinical findings|404684003
have
provided evidence|18669006
that adenosine,|35431001
a major inhibitory neurotransmitter|255603008|61511001|35069000
in the central nervous system,|21483005|278199004
plays|300776002
a role
in the development|278923009
of tardive dykinesias.

Tardive dykinesias
have
also
been
associated|47429007
with polymorphism|50334000
in the dopamine receptor D2 gene,|37484001|67271001
dopamine receptor D3 gene,|37484001|67271001
dopamine transporter (DAT) gene,|412383006|67271001|32779004|67271001
and
manganese superoxide dimutase (MnSOD) gene.|421451000|67271001

Tardive dyskinesias|49386006|102449007
are
chronic|90734009
compared
to acute dystonia,|272118002|272118002|15802004
which
occur|272120004
in a episodic fashion.|278499009

There
are
two lines|420797005|50009006
of treatment|276239002|416118004
for Pisa syndrome.

The first line|255216001|50009006|232714002|50009006
entails
discontinuation|278308006|410546004
or
reduction|58294000|260400001|289928003
in dose|277406006|408102007
of the antipsychotic drug|372482001
(s|288495006
).

The second line|81170007|50009006|257997001|50009006|288495006|50009006
of treatment|276239002|416118004
is
an anticholinergic medication.|373246003|410942007

A pharmacological therapy|56183000|276239002
for Pisa syndrome
caused|23981006|134198009
by prolonged use|255224006|277889008|255224006|419385000
of antipsychotic drugs|372482001
has
not
been
established|263748003|385645004
yet.[10]

Reducing|260400001
the dosage|277406006
of the antipsychotic drugs|372482001
resulted|42752001|394617004
in gradual improvement|255343009
in the abnormal posture.|43029002

In some cases,|398241000|413769002
discontinuing|410546004|421286000
the use|277889008|419385000
of those drugs|410942007
resulted|42752001|394617004
in complete disappearance|255594003
of the syndrome.

The time|410669006
it
took|419652001
for the improvement
and
the disappearance
of the syndrome
depended
on the type|261664005
of drug|410942007
being
administered|418283001
or
the specific cause|69658003|23981006|69658003|134198009
of the syndrome
itself.[10]

Anticholinergic drugs|373246003
have
been
reported|229059009|223458004
to
be
extremely effective|255403003|254648000
in 40%|259031006
of the patients|116154003
with the Pisa syndrome.

Patients|116154003
with Pisa syndrome
that
is
resistant|30714006
to anticholinergic drugs|373246003
is
mostly
resolved
by the reduction|58294000|260400001|289928003
of the administration|413454004|416118004
of the antipsychotic drugs|372482001
as
previously
mentioned.

While
the specific pathology|69658003|394595002
underlying|255546002
idiopathic Pisa syndrome|54690008
is
unknown|261665006
,
the administration|413454004|416118004
of anticholinergic drugs|373246003
has
provided resolution
in known cases.[10]|36692007|398241000|36692007|413769002

The first case|255216001|398241000|232714002|398241000
of Pisa syndrome
developed
under the use|277889008|419385000
of aripiprazole|406784005
was
documented|397934002
in May 2002.

A 77-year-old woman suffering|258707000|70753007|224526002|259039008|70753007|224526002
from dementia|12348006|52448006
was
administered|418283001
the drug|410942007
after
initially|884001
undergoing
treatment|276239002|416118004
with quetiapine.|386850001

After
about
a week|258705008|259038000
of the new treatment|7147002|276239002|7147002|416118004
with aripiprazole|406784005
the woman|224526002
began|255395001
to
exhibit
symptoms
of acute dystonia,|272118002|272118002|15802004
typical
of a patient|116154003
with Pisa syndrome.

Within a couple
of days|258703001
of
being
taken|419652001
off the treatment,|276239002|416118004
the patient|116154003
no longer|255511005
exhibited
the symptoms
of Pisa syndrome.

Although
the patient|116154003
exhibited Pisa syndrome
after
being
treated|28995006
with aripiprazole,|406784005
the patient?s development|116154003|278923009
of Pisa syndrome
could
have
been
caused|23981006|134198009
by her withdrawal
of quetiapine|386850001
and
her further introduction|46053002|107733003
of aripiprazole.[11]|406784005

Drug|410942007
switching
,
when
patients|116154003
switch
from one atypical antipsychotic drug|421379005|372648004|410942007|421379005|112231000|372482001
to another,
has
been
observed
to
produce
Pisa syndrome,
such as
in the case|398241000
of a 38-year-old male patient|264670000|258707000|70753007|248153007|116154003|264670000|259039008|70753007|248153007|116154003
being
treated|28995006
for schizophrenia.|58214004

The patient|116154003
began|255395001
to
develop
symptoms
of Pisa syndrome
after
switching
from olanzapine|386849001
to ziprasidone treatment.|409356003|276239002|409356003|416118004

The man|248153007|339947000|278412004
exhibited
both a leaning posture|363855006
at a 30?
angle|1483009
and
tilting
of his head|69536005|302548004
to the right side.|24028007

This process|415178003
was
also
exhibited
in a female patient also|248152002|116154003|224526002|116154003
suffering
from schizophrenia,|58214004
who
was
first|255216001|232714002
treated|28995006
with clozapine|387568001
and
then
switched
to ziprasidone.|409356003

The patient|116154003
was
able to|371150009
return|7528007
to her normal state weeks|17621005|398070004|258705008|258744000|398070004|258705008
after
being
taken|419652001
off of ziprasidone treatment.[12][13]|409356003|276239002|409356003|416118004

A man|248153007|339947000|278412004
diagnosed|439401001
with Parkinson?s disease|49049000
at the age|424144002
of 55,|264691008
began|255395001
to
develop
symptoms
of Pisa syndrome
after
switching
to
from his previous medication|9130008|410942007
to levodopa/carbidopa/entacapone tablets years|404830004|387018000|385055001|258707000|404830004|387018000|428673006|258707000
after his diagnosis.|439401001

The patient|116154003
had
no history|392521001
of taking
any particular medication|410942007
that previously developed Pisa syndrome
;
such as neuroleptics,|372482001
antidepressants,|372720008
antiemetic,|372764000
cholinesterase inhibitors,|52761007
or
any other similar form|74964007|246176004
of the drugs|410942007
known|36692007
to onset symptoms|77374008
of disease.|64572001

The patient|116154003
demonstrated
a tilting
of his trunk|22943007|262225004
toward the left side.|7771000

Once the patient|116154003
returned|7528007
to his original medication regiment,|19535007|410942007
the symptoms
of the tonic deviation|263739008|40885006
regressed.[14]

Pisa syndrome
was
discovered
by Karl Axel Ekbom,
a Swedish neurologist,|56397003
in the early 1970s.|264499004

Cases|398241000|413769002
of the syndrome
were
first|255216001|232714002
observed
in three elderly female patients|421291004|105436006|248152002|116154003|421291004|105436006|224526002|116154003
suffering
from presenile dementia.|12348006|52448006

Each
of these women|224526002
were
undergoing
treatment|276239002|416118004
with the antipsychotic drug methylperone,|372482001
haloperidol|386837002|25104002
or
a combination|89780004
of the two.|420797005

The use|277889008|419385000
of neuroleptic drugs|372482001
caused|23981006|134198009
the patients to|116154003
exhibit
a lateral flexion|255538003
along
with a rotation|70433009
of the trunk.|22943007|262225004

As the patients|116154003
walked|129006008|282146009
they
experienced
an increase|260366006
in rotation.|70433009

The postural|35799003
and
gait disturbances symptoms|22325002
is
what
set
this
apart from any other form|74964007|246176004
of acute dystonia previously|272118002|272118002|15802004
observed.

These symptoms
proved|277025001
to
be
the making
of a new dystonic reaction,|7147002|263851003
which
was
termed
pleurothotonus|34288008
or
Pisa syndrome.[15]

The first patient,|255216001|116154003|232714002|116154003
a 59-year-old woman|258707000|70753007|224526002|259039008|70753007|224526002
with no family history|57177007
of neuroleptic disease,|372482001|64572001
was
put
through two periods|420797005|259037005
of treatment|276239002|416118004
with methylperone.

The first trial|255216001|110465008|232714002|110465008
of the drug|410942007
was
administered|418283001
in February 1971.

In the beginning|255395001
the patient|116154003
demonstrated
no symptoms
of dystonia.|15802004

However,
within the first few days|255216001|258703001|232714002|258703001
the patient|116154003
began|255395001
to
exhibit
a tilting
to right|24028007
upon walking.|129006008

The women|224526002
was
then
taken|419652001
off the methylperone treatment|276239002|416118004
and
as a result progressively|394617004
regressed
back
to her previous state|9130008|398070004
of exhibiting
no symptoms
within the first two months.|255216001|420797005|258706009|232714002|420797005|258706009

The patient|116154003
started|385652002
a second trial|81170007|110465008|257997001|110465008|288495006|110465008
of methylperone treatment|276239002|416118004
in late October 1971.|260383002

After a little|281411007|255507004
over a week|258705008|259038000
of the drug treatment,|410942007|276239002|410942007|416118004
she
began|255395001
to
express
previous symptoms|9130008
that
including|55919000
a bending|89684003|282977007
of the trunk|22943007|262225004
towards the right|24028007
along
with a rotation.|70433009

The patient also|116154003
experienced
a pulling away|303370007
from her direction|260672003
of walking|129006008
and
a difficulty|371157007
of turning.|282987006

Within a couple
of days|258703001
of exhibiting symptoms,
the patient|116154003
was
then
treated|28995006
with orphenadrine.|372714007

This treatment|276239002|416118004
helped
regress
the expressed symptoms quicker|255358001
than the first time.|255216001|410669006|232714002|410669006

By the end|261782000|422117008
of the week|258705008|259038000
the patient|116154003
was
able to|371150009
return|7528007
to her normal state.[15]|17621005|398070004|258744000|398070004

The second patient to|2603003|116154003
undergo
methylperone treatment|276239002|416118004
was
a 63-year-old woman|258707000|70753007|224526002|259039008|70753007|224526002
with presenile dementia,|12348006|52448006
which
caused|23981006|134198009
her to
experience
restlessness|162221009
and
paranoid hallucinations.|7011001

The methylperone treatment|276239002|416118004
was
able to|371150009
alleviate
the woman?s problems|224526002|55607006
induced|16404004
by her dementia.|12348006|52448006

It
did
not
take|419652001
long|255511005
for the woman to|224526002
begin|255395001
to
experience
symptoms
of Pisa syndrome
and
as a result|394617004
she
was
taken|419652001
off of the methylperone treatment.|276239002|416118004

Like the first patient,|255216001|116154003|232714002|116154003
she
was
able to|371150009
overcome
the induced symptoms|16404004
of Pisa syndrome
within a month.|258706009|259036001

The patient|116154003
was
again
treated|28995006
with methylperone
after two months|420797005|258706009
from the first treatment.|255216001|276239002|255216001|416118004|232714002|276239002|232714002|416118004

Soon
after the patient|116154003
began|255395001
to lean
toward the right|24028007
when
standing|10904000
or
walking.|129006008

She
was
then administered orphenadrine,|418283001|372714007
which soon
stopped|385654001
the patient?s|116154003
tilting
posture.[15]|363855006

The final patient|42796001|116154003
was
a 69-year-old woman,|264698002|258707000|70753007|224526002|264698002|259039008|70753007|224526002
diagnosed|439401001
with presenile dementia|12348006|52448006
after
she expressing symptoms
of memory dysfunction,|386807006
depression|35489007|366979004|255339005
and
urinary incontinence.|165232002

As a
result|394617004
the woman|224526002
was
put
under a methylperone treatment,|276239002|416118004
which soon
caused|23981006|134198009
a bending|89684003|282977007
and
rotation|70433009
to her left.|7771000

These symptoms
disappeared
soon
after
being
taken|419652001
off of methylperone.

Unlike the other two patients,|74964007|420797005|116154003
when
the woman|224526002
was
again administered methylperone|418283001
she
did
not
exhibit
any previous dystonic symptoms|9130008
after two weeks|420797005|258705008
of treatment.|276239002|416118004

The patient|116154003
was
then
switched
to a small dosage|255507004|277406006
of haloperidol|386837002|25104002
along
with the typical dosage|277406006
of orphenadrine|372714007
used|394850002
on the previous patients.|9130008|116154003

Instead of
not
having
symptoms
of Pisa syndrome,
the woman|224526002
began|255395001
to
experience
a leaning
to her left side|7771000
and
a particular rotation|70433009
of her shoulder|16982005|361103004
towards the left.|7771000

Once haloperidol|386837002|25104002
was
eliminated
from the treatment|276239002|416118004
the patient|116154003
no longer|255511005
had
these symptoms.[15]

As
more cases|242762006|398241000|242762006|413769002
of the syndrome
came
about,
research
discovered
that
the
switching
of drug treatments|410942007|276239002
can
be
debated
as a possible inducer|371930009|60022001
of the disease.|64572001

Other cases|74964007|398241000|74964007|413769002
of the disease|64572001
have
been
proven|277025001
to
be
caused|23981006|134198009
by medications|410942007
other than neuroleptic drugs.|372482001

These patients|116154003
were
observed
exhibiting symptoms
of Pisa syndrome
as a result|394617004
of
having
a prior neurodegenerative disease.|236874000|64572001

Current research|15240007
has
been
focusing|251776000
on discovering
the underlying mechanisms|257544000
of Pisa syndrome,
since
little|281411007|255507004
is
known|36692007
about the biological|12893009
and
pharmacological reasons Pisa syndrome|56183000|410666004
occurs|272120004
(
although
theories
about dopaminergic dysfunction|16257000|386585008
have
been
suggested
).

While
Pisa syndrome
is
mostly
associated|47429007
with antipsychotic drugs,|372482001
there
have
been
incidents
of idiopathic Pisa Syndrome,|54690008
the development|278923009
of Pisa syndrome
in those with other neurological disorders,|20401003|118940003|421463005|118940003
and
Pisa syndrome
in those with intellectual disability.|20401003|91138005|421463005|91138005

Future research
hopes
to
pinpoint
the essential neurological disorder|34325006|118940003
or
disorders|64572001
underlying|255546002
the development|278923009
of Pisa syndrome
so
more
that more effective medication|242762006|255403003|410942007|242762006|254648000|410942007
and
treatment|276239002|416118004
may
be
created
and/or
administered.|418283001
