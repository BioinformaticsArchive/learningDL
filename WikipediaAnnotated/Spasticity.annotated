*Spasticity|397790002
*
*
is
a feature
of altered skeletal muscle performance|127954009|244716004
in muscle tone|6918002
involving|248448006
hypertonia|56731001
;
it
is
also
referred|439980006
to
as
an unusual "tightness",|255365009
stiffness,|271587009
and/or
"pull"|303370007
of muscles.|91727004

The word spasm|255373000|45352006
comes
from the Greek word,|1451003|255373000
_???????_
(spasmos
)
,
meaning|255586005
to pull|303370007
or
drag.|416731003

Clinically spasticity|397790002
is
defined
as velocity dependent resistance to|272147009|371154000|30714006
stretch|122546009
,
where
a lack|41277001
of inhibition|61511001|419495008
results|394617004
in excessive contraction|260378005|78558002
of the muscles,|91727004
ultimately
leading|236874000
to hyperflexia
(overly flexed joints|9964006|39352004|9964006|81087007
).

It mostly
occurs|272120004
in disorders|64572001
of the central nervous system (CNS)|21483005|278199004
impacting|134293005
the upper motor neuron|91769000
in the form|246176004
of a lesion,
such as spastic diplegia,|281411007
but
it
can
also
present|52101004|246105001
in various types|256220008|261664005
of multiple sclerosis,|24700007
where
it
occurs|272120004
as a symptom
of the progressively-worsening attacks|230993007|216299002|231877006|216299002
on myelin sheaths|23879005
and
is
thus
unrelated|262241003
to the types|261664005
of spasticity present|397790002|52101004|397790002|246105001
in neuromuscular cerebral palsy|128188000
rooted|85077000|2338009|285110007
spasticity disorders.|397790002|64572001

The clinical underpinnings|58147004
of two|420797005
of the most common spasticity conditions,|4757001|72906007|397790002|260905004
spastic diplegia|281411007
and
multiple sclerosis,|24700007
can
be
described
as
follows|367409002
:
in spastic diplegia,|281411007
the upper motor neuron lesion|299738004
arises|68727004
often|70232002
as a result|394617004
of neonatal asphyxia,|413654009
while
in conditions|260905004
like multiple sclerosis,|24700007
spasticity|397790002
is
thought|88952004
by some to
be
as a result|394617004
of the autoimmune destruction|263680009|64597002
of the myelin sheaths|23879005
around nerve endings ?|3057000|261782000|3057000|422117008|256864008|261782000|256864008|422117008
which in turn|282987006
can
_
mimic
_
the gamma amino butyric acid deficiencies|421416008|82994006|226888007
present|52101004|246105001
in the damaged nerves|37782003|3057000
of spastic diplegics,|263875003
leading|236874000
to roughly
the same _presentation_|262126009|246105001
of spasticity,|397790002
but
which clinically
is
fundamentally different|263735002
from the latter.

*Spasticity Pathophysiology|397790002|386585008
*
*

The cause|134198009
of spasticity|397790002
is
not really
known|36692007
,
but
there
are
several theories.|261028005

In general, spasticity|60132005|397790002
develops
when
an imbalance
occurs|272120004
in the excitatory
and
inhibitory input|61511001
to ? motor neurons|31513005
caused|23981006|134198009
by damage|37782003
to the spinal cord|2748008|180959008
and/or
central nervous system.|21483005|278199004

The damage|37782003
causes|134198009
a change|243326001|263703002
in the balance|249982003|78933003|282295000
of signals
between the nervous system|25087005|278196006
and
the muscles,|91727004
leading|236874000
to increased excitability|35105006|102893002|260366006|102893002
in the muscles.|91727004

One factor|421379005
that
is
thought to|88952004
be
related|272151006|262094002
to spasticity|397790002
is
the stretch reflex.|63177006

This reflex|87572000|106146005
is
important
in coordinating normal movements|404978003|17621005|404978003|258744000
in which muscles|91727004
are
contracted|78558002
and
relaxed|15166001
and
in keeping
the muscle|91727004
from
stretching|122546009
too far.|46053002

Although
the end result|261782000|394617004|422117008|394617004
of spasticity|397790002
is
problems|55607006
with the muscles,|91727004
spasticity|397790002
is
actually
caused|23981006|134198009
by an injury
to a part|260726005
of the central nervous system|21483005|278199004
(
the brain|12738006|258335003
or
spinal cord|2748008|180959008
)
that
controls|54776003|31509003
voluntary movements.|255375007|255324009

The damage|37782003
causes|134198009
a change|243326001|263703002
in the balance|249982003|78933003|282295000
of signals
between the nervous system|25087005|278196006
and
the muscles.|91727004

This imbalance
leads|88488004|236874000
to increased activity|28277004
(excitability|102893002
)
in the muscles.|91727004

Receptors|116647005
in the muscles|91727004
receive
messages
from the nervous system,|25087005|278196006
which
sense|106148006
the amount|107651007
of stretch|122546009
in the muscle|91727004
and
sends
that signal
to the brain.|12738006|258335003

The brain|12738006|258335003
responds
by sending
a message
back to
reverse
the stretch|122546009
by contracting|78558002
or
shortening.[1]|129350004

Overall,
a defining feature
of spasticity|397790002
is
that
the increased resistance|35105006|30714006|260366006|30714006
to passive stretch|122546009
is
velocity-dependent.|272147009|371154000

Lance|102338002
(1980
)
describes
it this way
: ?...
a motor disorder,|64572001
characterised
by a velocity-dependent increase|272147009|371154000|260366006
in tonic stretch reflexes|63177006
(muscle tone|6918002
)
with exaggerated tendon jerks,|260377000|13024002|60238002|260377000|256667004|60238002
resulting|42752001
from hyper-excitability|44548000|102893002
of the stretch reflex|63177006
as one component|421379005|246093002
of the upper motor neurone (UMN) syndrome."_[citation|91769000
needed|410525008|103325001
_]

Spasticity|397790002
is
found|404684003
in conditions|260905004
where the brain|12738006|258335003
and/or
spinal cord|2748008|180959008
are
damaged|37782003
or
fail
to
develop
normally
;
these
include|55919000
cerebral palsy,|128188000
multiple sclerosis,|24700007
spinal cord injury|90584004
and
acquired brain injury|2470005
including|55919000
stroke.|230690007

Damage|37782003
to the CNS
as a result|394617004
of stroke|230690007
or
spinal cord injury,|90584004
alter
the [net inhibition]|255442003|61511001|255442003|419495008
of peripheral nerves|84782009
in the affected region.|247591002|410673009|248448006|410673009

This change|243326001|263703002
in input
to bodily structures
tends
to
favor
excitation
and
therefore
increase|260366006
nerve excitability.|3057000|102893002|256864008|102893002

CNS
damage|37782003
also
causes|134198009
nerve cell membranes to|3057000|53982002|256864008|53982002
rest|258157001
in a more [depolarized] state.|242762006|398070004

The combination|89780004
of decreased inhibition|1250004|61511001|1250004|419495008|260400001|61511001|260400001|419495008|260371004|61511001|260371004|419495008
and
an increased depolarized state|35105006|398070004|260366006|398070004
of cell membranes,|53982002
decreases|260370003
action potential threshold|129264002|30207005|118589004
for nerve signal conduction,|22690006
and
thus
increases|260366006
activity|48761009|55561003|258745004|257733005
of structures
innervated
by the affected nerves|247591002|3057000|248448006|3057000
(spasticity|397790002
).

Muscles|91727004
affected|247591002|248448006
in this way
have
many other potential features|74964007|30207005
of altered performance
in addition|260364009
to spasticity,|397790002
including|55919000
muscle _weakness_|26544005
;
decreased movement control|1250004|249960005|260400001|249960005|260371004|249960005
;
clonus|36649002
(
a series|13039001
of involuntary rapid muscle contractions|102542000|255358001
often symptomatic|70232002|264931009
of muscle over-exertion|91727004|419912001
and/or
muscle fatigue|80449002

;
exaggerated deep tendon reflexes|86854008|131197000|13024002|86854008|131197000|256667004

and
Clonus|36649002

Clonus|36649002
tends
to
co-exist
with spasticity|397790002
in many cases|398241000|413769002
of stroke|230690007
and
spinal cord injury likely|90584004|2931005
due to their common physiological origins.|72906007|1360005|255395001

Some
consider
clonus|36649002
as
simply
an extended outcome|255536004|394617004|288467006|394617004|255590007|394617004
of spasticity.|397790002

Although
closely
linked
,
clonus|36649002
is
not
seen
in all patients|116154003
with spasticity.|397790002

Clonus|36649002
tends
to
not
be
present|52101004|246105001
with spasticity|397790002
in patients|116154003
with significantly increased muscle tone,|56731001
as
the muscles|91727004
are
constantly active|55561003
and
therefore
not
engaging|54986009
in the characteristic
on/
off cycle|44180009
of clonus.|36649002

Clonus|36649002
results|394617004
due to an increased motor neuron excitation|35105006|48388002|260366006|48388002
(decreased action potential threshold|1250004|129264002|30207005|118589004|260400001|129264002|30207005|118589004|260371004|129264002|30207005|118589004
and
is
common|72906007
in muscles|91727004
with long conduction delays,|255511005|251089002|255511005|278252000
such as the long reflex tracts|255511005|87572000|255511005|106146005

in distal muscle groups.|46053002|91727004|261586004|46053002|91727004|160481000

Clonus|36649002
is
commonly
seen
in the ankle|70258002|108371006|361292008
but
may
exist
in other distal structures|74964007|46053002
as well,|20572008
such as the knee|304679005|49076000|361291001|72696002
or
spine.[3]|421060004|44300000|243930007

of spasticity|397790002
and
the upper motor neuron lesion|299738004
it
is
based|418836005
on
has
progressed|385651009
considerably
in recent decades.|6493001

However,
the term "spasticity"|397790002
is
still often|70232002
used interchangeably|394850002
with "Upper Motor Neuron Syndrome"|91769000
in the clinical settings,|58147004
and
it
is
not unusual to
see|281004000
patients|116154003
labeled
as "spastic"|263875003
who actually
demonstrate
not just spasticity|397790002
alone,|105529008
but
also
an array
of upper motor neuron findings[4]|91769000|404684003|91769000

Research
has
clearly
shown
that exercise|61686008
is
beneficial
for spastic muscles,|263875003|91727004
[5] even|264706000|264605009
though
in the very early days|260358002|264499004|258703001
of research
it
was
assumed
that strength exercise|260404005|61686008
would
_increase_ spasticity.|260366006|397790002

Also,
from
at least
the 1950s
through
at least
the 1980s,
there
was
a strong focus|260404005|87017008|260404005|363702006
on other interventions|74964007|225334002
for spastic muscles,|263875003|91727004
particularly
stretching|122546009
and
splinting,|79321009
but
the evidence|18669006
does
not
support|9096001|243114000
these
as effective.|255403003|254648000

While
splinting|79321009
is
not
considered
effective|255403003|254648000
for decreasing spasticity,|260371004|397790002
a range
of different orthotics|263735002
are
effectively
used|394850002
for preventing muscle contractures|55033002|116699007|55033002
on patients|116154003
with spasticity.|397790002

In the case|398241000
of spastic diplegia there|281411007
is
also
a permanent neurosurgical treatment|6934004|276239002|6934004|416118004
for spasticity,|397790002
selective dorsal rhizotomy,|255551008|19214009
that directly
targets
nerves|3057000
in the spine|421060004|44300000|243930007
that
cause|23981006|134198009
the spasticity,|397790002
and
destroys
them,
so
that
the spasticity|397790002
cannot
be
activated
at all.

Spasticity|397790002
is
assessed
by feeling|285854004
the resistance|30714006
of the muscle|91727004
to passive lengthening|129349004
in its
most relaxed state.|15166001|398070004

A spastic muscle|263875003|91727004
will
have
immediately noticeable, often quite forceful, increased resistance|49499008|70232002|35105006|30714006|49499008|70232002|260366006|30714006|49499008|70232002|285653008|35105006|30714006|49499008|70232002|285653008|260366006|30714006
to passive stretch|122546009
when
moved|384598002|370125004
with speed
and/or
while
attempting
to
be
stretched|386781001|122546009
out,|255529000
as
compared
to the non-spastic muscles|263875003|91727004
in the same person's body|262126009|125676002|279495008|262126009|125676002|123037004
(
if
any
exist
).

As
there
are
many features|260396001
of the Upper Motor Neuron Syndrome,|91769000
there
are
likely to|2931005
be
multiple other changes|260396001|243326001|260396001|263703002
in affected musculature|247591002|248448006

in spastic diplegia.|281411007

Also,
following|255260001
an upper motor neuron lesion,|299738004
there
may
be
multiple muscles|260396001|91727004
affected|247591002|248448006
,
to varying degrees,|246173007
depending
on the location|246267002
and
severity|272141005
of the upper motor neuron damage.|91769000|37782003

The result|394617004
for the affected individual,|247591002|125676002|247591002|385435006|248448006|125676002|248448006|385435006
is
that
they
may
have
any degree|258395000|246173007
of impairment,|40226000
ranging
from a mild|255604002
to a severe movement disorder.|24484000|60342002

A relatively mild movement disorder|255604002|60342002
may
contribute
to a loss
of dexterity|288361006
in an arm,|40983000|53120007|182245002|302538001
or
difficulty|371157007
with high level mobility|75540009|258395000|363803005|75540009|258395000|246197003|75540009|276625007|363803005|75540009|276625007|246197003|371879000|258395000|363803005|371879000|258395000|246197003|371879000|276625007|363803005|371879000|276625007|246197003
such as running|418060005
or
walking|129006008
on stairs.

A severe movement disorder|24484000|60342002
may
result|394617004
in marked loss|46998006
of function|246464006
with minimal|255605001|255604002
or
no volitional muscle activation.|225467002|91727004

There
are
several scales|261028005|19892000|261028005|13389002
used|394850002
to
measure|246445000|272391002
spasticity,|397790002
such as the King?s Hypertonicity Scale_[citation|56731001|19892000|56731001|278111002
needed|410525008|103325001
_],
the Tardieu_[citation
needed|410525008|103325001
_],
and
the Modified Ashworth_[citation|243326001
needed|410525008|103325001
_].

Of these three,|421291004
only
the King?s Hypertonicity Scale|56731001|19892000|56731001|278111002
measures|246445000|367346004
a range
of muscle|91727004
changes|243326001|263703002
from the UMN lesion,
including|55919000
active muscle performance|55561003|91727004
as well as
passive response to
stretch.|122546009

Assessment|386053000
of a movement disorder featuring spasticity|60342002|397790002
may
involve|248448006
several health professionals|261028005|261028005|223366009
depending
on the affected individual's situation,|247591002|125676002|247591002|385435006|248448006|125676002|248448006|385435006
and
the severity|272141005
of their condition.|260905004

This
may
include|55919000
physical therapists,|36682004
doctors|309343006
(
including|55919000
neurologists|56397003
and
rehabilitation physicians|309360001
)
,
orthotists|309428008
and
occupational therapists.|80546007

Assessment|386053000
is
needed|410525008|103325001
of the affected individual's goals,|247591002|125676002|410518001|247591002|385435006|410518001|248448006|125676002|410518001|248448006|385435006|410518001
their function,|246464006
and
any symptoms
that
may
be
related|272151006|262094002
to the movement disorder,|60342002
such as pain.|22253000

A thorough assessment|386053000
will
include|55919000
analysis|272389005
of posture,|363855006
active movement,|35897007
muscle strength,|91727004|260404005
movement control|249960005
and
coordination,|85352007
and
endurance,|406203001
as well as
spasticity|397790002
(response
of the muscle to|91727004
stretch|122546009
).

Spastic muscles typically|263875003|91727004
demonstrate
a loss
of selective movement,|255324009
including|55919000
a loss
of eccentric control|255380003|31509003
(decreased ability|1250004|371150009|260400001|371150009|260371004|371150009
to actively lengthen|358612008|129349004
).

While
multiple muscles|260396001|91727004
in a limb|66019005|243996003
are
usually
affected|247591002|248448006
in the Upper Motor Neuron Syndrome,|91769000
there
is
usually
an imbalance
of activity,|48761009|55561003|258745004|257733005
such
that there
is
a stronger pull|260404005|303370007
in one direction,|421379005|260672003
such as
into elbow flexion.|127949000|9964006|16953009|9964006|76248009|9964006

Decreasing|260371004
the degree|258395000|246173007
of this imbalance
is
a common focus|72906007|87017008|72906007|363702006
of muscle strengthening programs.|91727004

Spastic movement disorders also typically|263875003|60342002
feature
a loss
of stabilisation|115979005
of an affected limb|247591002|66019005|247591002|243996003|248448006|66019005|248448006|243996003
or
the head|69536005|302548004
from the trunk,|22943007|262225004
so
a thorough assessment|386053000
requires
this to
be
analysed
as well.|20572008

Secondary effects|2603003|253861007|81170007|253861007
are
likely|2931005
to impact|134293005
on assessment|386053000
of spastic muscles.|263875003|91727004

If
a muscle|91727004
has
impaired function|260379002|246464006|40226000|246464006
following|255260001
an upper motor neuron lesion,|299738004
other changes|74964007|243326001|74964007|263703002
such as increased muscle stiffness|35105006|260366006
are
likely to|2931005
affect|4065008
the feeling|285854004
of resistance|30714006
to passive stretch.|122546009

Other secondary changes|74964007|2603003|243326001|74964007|2603003|263703002|74964007|81170007|243326001|74964007|81170007|263703002
such as loss
of muscle fibres|91727004|400293002|91727004|37202001
following|255260001
acquired muscle weakness|255396000|255396000|26544005
are
likely|2931005
to compound|62105006
the weakness arising|13791008|68727004|68727004|260407003|68727004
from the upper motor neuron lesion.|299738004

In severely|24484000
affected|247591002|248448006
spastic muscles,|263875003|91727004
there
may
be
marked|46998006
secondary changes,|2603003|243326001|2603003|263703002|81170007|243326001|81170007|263703002
such as muscle contracture,|55033002
particularly
if
management|413454004|119270007
has
been
delayed
or
absent.|2667000

Treatment|276239002|416118004
should
be
based|418836005
on assessment|386053000
by relevant health professionals.|223366009

For spastic muscles|263875003|91727004
with mild-to-moderate impairment,|371923003|40226000
exercise|61686008
should
be
the mainstay
of management,|413454004|119270007
and
is
likely|2931005
needed to|410525008|103325001
be
prescribed
by a physical therapist|36682004
or
other health professional skilled
in neurological rehabilitation.|25855006

Muscles|91727004
with severe spasticity|24484000|397790002
are
likely to|2931005
be
more
limited|255469002
in their ability to|371150009
exercise|61686008
,
and
may
require
help
to do
this.

They
may
require
additional interventions,|260364009|225334002
to
manage|119270007
the greater neurological impairment|263768009|264552009
and
also
the greater secondary complications.|263768009|2603003|116223007|263768009|81170007|116223007

These secondary complications|2603003|116223007|81170007|116223007
involve|248448006
the development|278923009
of contractures,|55033002
deformity|276654001|127560004|417893002
and
postural asymmetries.|35799003|4128009

Interventions|225334002
may
include|55919000
icing,|229871004
serial casting,
sustained|263892007
stretching|122546009
,
inhibitory pressure|61511001|279046003|61511001|13543005|61511001|257893003
and
medical interventions.|74188005|225334002

Treatment|276239002|416118004
should
be
done
with firm|20583004
and
constant manual contact|87982008|11723008|87982008|70862002
positioned|226048001|246449006|229824005
over nonspastic areas to|42798000
avoid
stimulating
the spastic muscle|263875003|91727004
(s|288495006
).

Alternatively,
rehabilitation robotics|52052004|394602003
can
be
used|394850002
to
provide
high volumes|75540009|118565006|371879000|118565006
of passive
or
assisted movement,|371152001|255324009
depending
on the individual's requirements|125676002|385435006
;[7]
this form|246176004
of therapy|276239002
can
be
useful
if therapists
are
at a premium,
and
has
been
found effective|404684003|255403003|404684003|254648000|255403003|254648000
at reducing spasticity|260400001|397790002
in patients|116154003
suffering
from stroke.|230690007

For muscles|91727004
that
lack|41277001
any volitional control,|225467002|31509003
such as
after
complete spinal cord injury,|255594003|90584004
exercise|61686008
may
be
assisted|371152001
,
and
may
require
equipment,|246137000
such as
using|260676000
a standing frame to|183150009
sustain|263892007
a standing position.|10904000

A general treatment guideline|7922000
can
be
followed|367409002
that
involves|248448006
:

Medical interventions|74188005|225334002
may
include|55919000
such medications|410942007
as baclofen,|387342009
diazepam,|387264003
dantrolene,|372819007
or
clonazepam.|387383007

Phenol injections|300070004|28289002|300070004|129326001|116613007|28289002|116613007|129326001
can
be
used|394850002
,
or
botulinum toxin injections|404909007
into the muscle belly,|29823001
to
attempt
to
dampen
the signals
between nerve|3057000|256864008
and
muscle.|91727004

The effectiveness|255403003
of medications|410942007
vary
between individuals,|125676002|385435006
and
vary
based|418836005
on location|246267002
of the upper motor neuron lesion|299738004
(
in the brain|12738006|258335003
or
the spinal cord|2748008|180959008
).

Medications|410942007
are
commonly
used|394850002
for spastic movement disorders,|263875003|60342002
but
research
has
not
shown
functional benefit|40143009|246464006
for some drugs.|410942007

Some studies|110465008|224699009
have
shown
that medications|410942007
have
been
effective|255403003|254648000
in decreasing spasticity,|260371004|397790002
but
that
this
has
not
been
accompanied
by functional benefits.|40143009|246464006

Surgery|83578000
could
be
required
for a tendon release|122484000
in the case|398241000
of a severe muscle imbalance|24484000|91727004
leading|236874000
to contracture.|55033002

In spastic CP,|263875003
selective dorsal rhizotomy|255551008|19214009
has
also
been
used|394850002
to
decrease|260400001|260370003
muscle overactivity.|91727004|28277004|91727004

Incorporating hydrotherapy|46903006
in the treatment program|276239002|416118004
may
help
decrease spasm severity,|260400001|45352006|272141005|260370003|45352006|272141005
promote
functional independence,|40143009|371153006|246464006|371153006
improve|385425000|3442003|385633008
motor recovery
and
decrease medication|260400001|410942007|260370003|410942007
required
for spasticity,|397790002
which
may
help
reduce|260400001
the side effects
that
are
possible|371930009|60022001
with oral drug treatments.|260548002|410942007|276239002

A 2004 study|110465008|224699009
compared
the effects|253861007
of hydrotherapy|46903006
on spasticity,|397790002
oral baclofen dosage|260548002|387342009|277406006
and
Functional Independence Measure (FIM) scores|273469003|278061009
of patients|116154003
with a spinal cord injury (SCI).|90584004

It
was
found|404684003
that subjects
who
received
hydrotherapy treatment|46903006|276239002|46903006|416118004
obtained|398092000
increased FIM scores|35105006|278061009|260366006|278061009
and
a decreased intake|1250004|260400001|260371004
of oral baclofen medication.|260548002|387342009|410942007

A 2009 study|110465008|224699009
looked|386548000
at the effect|253861007
of hydrotherapy to|46903006
decrease|260400001|260370003
spasticity|397790002
on post-stroke, hemiparetic patients|288563008|230690007|116154003
with limited mobility|8510008
and
concluded
that there
was
a significantly larger increase|255509001|260366006|263768009|260366006
in FIM scores|278061009
compared
to the control group|31509003|261586004|31509003|160481000|31509003|389109008
that
did
not
receive
hydrotherapy.[13]|46903006

The prognosis|20481000
for those with spastic muscles|20401003|263875003|91727004|421463005|263875003|91727004
depends
on multiple factors,|260396001
including|55919000
the severity|272141005
of the spasticity|397790002
and
the associated movement disorder,|116690006|255324009|47429007|60342002
access|260507000
to specialised|67995009
and
intensive management,|413454004|119270007
and
ability|371150009
of the affected individual to|247591002|125676002|247591002|385435006|248448006|125676002|248448006|385435006
maintain|385630006
the management plan|413454004|52713000|413454004|397943006|119270007|52713000|119270007|397943006
(particularly
an exercise program|61686008
).

Most people|125676002
with a significant UMN lesion|386134007
will
have
ongoing impairment,|255238004|40226000
but
most
of these
will
be
able to|371150009
make
progress.|385651009

The most important factor to|4757001
indicate|410535002
ability to|371150009
progress|385651009
is
seeing|281004000
improvement,
but
improvement
in many spastic movement disorders|263875003|60342002
may
not
