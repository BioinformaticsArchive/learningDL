*Cholera|63650001
*
*
is
an infection
in the small intestine|264196002|181250005
caused|23981006|134198009
by the bacterium _Vibrio cholerae_.|409822003|75953000

The main symptoms|63161005
are
profuse,
watery diarrhea|263930000|398032003
and
vomiting.|249497008

Transmission|258150004
occurs|272120004
primarily
by drinking water|160573003|11713004|160573003|119318008|30953006|11713004|30953006|119318008
or
eating food|48263008|255620007
that
has
been
contaminated|62604006
by the feces|39477002
of an infected person,|125676002
including|55919000
one|421379005
with no apparent symptoms.

The severity|272141005
of the diarrhea|398032003
and
vomiting|249497008
can
lead|88488004
to rapid dehydration|255358001|34095006
and
electrolyte imbalance,|105593004
and
death|419620001|268923008
in some cases.|398241000|413769002

The primary treatment|63161005|276239002|63161005|416118004|261424001|276239002|261424001|416118004
is
oral rehydration therapy,|243222002
typically
with oral rehydration solution (ORS),|409585005
to
replace|282089006|370124000
water|11713004|119318008
and
electrolytes.|86355000

If
this
is
not
tolerated
or
does
not
provide
improvement fast enough,|16985007|277748003
intravenous fluids|118431008
can
also
be
used.|394850002

Antibacterial drugs|419241000
are
beneficial
in those with severe disease to|20401003|24484000|64572001|421463005|24484000|64572001
shorten|129350004|359530003
its duration|103335007
and
severity.|272141005

Worldwide,
it
affects|4065008
3?5 million people|260280001|125676002
and
causes|134198009
100,000?130,000 deaths|419620001|268923008
a year|258707000|259039008
as of 2010[[update]]
(//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title|419205000
=Cholera&action|63650001|129264002

).

Cholera|63650001
was
one|421379005
of the earliest infections to|264499004
be
studied|110465008|224699009
by epidemiological methods.|260686004|272394005

The primary symptoms|63161005|261424001
of cholera|63650001
are
profuse,
painless diarrhea|255350008|398032003
and
vomiting|249497008
of clear fluid.|228051000

These symptoms usually
start|255395001
suddenly,
one to five days|421379005|421820001|258703001
after ingestion|111984006
of the bacteria.|409822003

The diarrhea|398032003
is
frequently|70232002
described
as "rice water"|263858009
in nature|277302009
and
may
have
a fishy odor.|90580008|103371008

An untreated person|25265005|125676002
with cholera|63650001
may
produce
10
to 20 litres|258770004
(3
to 5|264706000|264605009
US gal
)
of diarrhea|398032003
a day[1]|258703001|259032004
with fatal results.|399166001|394617004

For every symptomatic person,|264931009|125676002
3
to 100 people|125676002
get
the infection
but
remain
asymptomatic.|84387000

Cholera|63650001
has
been
nicknamed
the "blue death"|405738005|419620001|405738005|268923008
due to a patient's skin|116154003|119325001|116154003|39937001|116154003|181469002
turning|282987006
a bluish-gray hue|229029004|371253002
from extreme loss|12565001
of fluids.[3]|32457005|33463005

If
the severe diarrhea|409587002
is
not
treated|28995006
with intravenous rehydration,|243221009|255560000|243221009
it
can
result|394617004
in life-threatening dehydration|52101004|224130005|34095006|18720000|224130005|34095006
and
electrolyte imbalances.|105593004

The typical symptoms
of dehydration|34095006
include|55919000
low blood pressure,|45007003
poor skin turgor|11403006|26669000|255351007|26669000
(wrinkled hands|247434009|85562004|27367001|85562004
)
,
sunken eyes,|246923005
and
a rapid pulse.[1]|3424008

Transmission|258150004
is
primarily
by the fecal contamination|39477002
of food|255620007
and
water|11713004|119318008
caused|23981006|134198009
by poor sanitation.|11403006|255351007

This bacterium|409822003
can
,
however,
live|419749002
naturally
in any environment.[5]|276339004

About 100 million bacteria|409822003
must
typically
be
ingested|111984006
to
cause|23981006|134198009
cholera|63650001
in a normal healthy adult.|17621005|102512003|258744000|102512003

This dose,|277406006|408102007
however,
is
less
in those with lowered gastric acidity|20401003|261122009|178960009|20401003|385440003|178960009|421463005|261122009|178960009|421463005|385440003|178960009
(
for instance
those
using|260676000
proton pump inhibitors.|372525000

Children|410601007|160499008
are
also more susceptible,|131196009
with two-|420797005
to four-year-olds|421534005|258707000|70753007|421534005|259039008|70753007
having
the highest rates|75540009|371879000
of infection.

Individuals' susceptibility|125676002|76522002|125676002|118588007|385435006|76522002|385435006|118588007
to cholera|63650001
is
also
affected|247591002|248448006
by their blood type,|44608003
with those with type O blood|20401003|58460004|421463005|58460004
being
the most susceptible.|4757001|131196009

Persons|125676002
with lowered immunity,|261122009|58915005|385440003|58915005
such as persons|125676002
with AIDS|62479008
or
children|410601007|160499008
who
are
malnourished|248325000
,
are
more likely to|242762006|2931005
experience
a severe case|24484000|398241000
if
they
become
infected.

However,
it
should
be
noted
that
any individual,|125676002|385435006
even
a healthy adult|102512003
in middle age,|28288005
can
experience
a severe case,|24484000|398241000
and
each person's case|125676002|398241000
should
be
measured|258104002
by the loss
of fluids,|32457005|33463005
preferably
in consultation|11429006
with a doctor|309343006
or
other health worker.|74964007|263775005|106541005

The cystic fibrosis genetic mutation|190905008|55446002
in humans|278412004
has
been
said|66049007
to
maintain|385630006
a selective advantage
:
heterozygous carriers|14556007|47461006
of the mutation|55446002
(
who
are
thus
not
affected|247591002|248448006
by cystic fibrosis|190905008
)
are
more resistant|242762006|30714006
to _V.

cholerae_ infections.|63650001

In this model,
the genetic deficiency|3950001|260372006|3950001|248325000|255395001|260372006|255395001|248325000
in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator channel proteins|190905008|255592004|88878007
interferes|78235001
with bacteria binding|409822003|257768005
to the gastrointestinal epithelium,|31610004
thus
reducing|260400001
the effects|253861007
of an infection.

Cholera|63650001
is
typically
transmitted|60117003|258150004
by
either
contaminated food|228034007
or
water.|11713004|119318008

In the developed world,
seafood|44027008
is
the usual cause,|134198009
while
in the developing world
it
is
more often water.|242762006|70232002|11713004|242762006|70232002|119318008

Cholera|63650001
has
been
found|404684003
in only|50607009|420295001
two|420797005
other animal populations|74964007|387961004|385436007
:
shellfish|227146005|54787006
and
plankton.[1]

People|125676002
infected
with cholera often|63650001|70232002
have
diarrhea,|398032003
and
if
this highly liquid stool,|75540009|398212009
colloquially
referred|439980006
to
as
"rice-water",|263858009
contaminates|62604006
water|11713004|119318008
used|394850002
by others,|74964007
disease transmission|64572001|258150004
may
occur.|272120004

The source|260753009
of the contamination
is
typically other cholera sufferers|63650001
when
their untreated diarrheal discharge|25265005|398032003|307488001|25265005|398032003|58000006
is
allowed to
get
into waterways,
groundwater
or
drinking water supplies.|160573003|11713004|425398004|160573003|119318008|425398004|30953006|11713004|425398004|30953006|119318008|425398004

Drinking|160573003|30953006
any infected water|11713004|119318008
and
eating|48263008
any foods|255620007
washed
in the water,|11713004|119318008
as well as
shellfish living|227146005|54787006
in the affected waterway,|247591002|248448006
can
cause|23981006|134198009
a person to|125676002
contract|78558002
an infection.

Cholera|63650001
is
rarely|103356009
spread|410677005
directly
from person|125676002
to person.|125676002

Both
toxic
and
nontoxic strains|48532005|276768000
exist.

Nontoxic strains|48532005|276768000
can
acquire|255396000
toxicity
through a temperate bacteriophage.|67068001

Coastal cholera outbreaks typically|63650001|443684005
follow|367409002|421939007
zooplankton blooms,
thus
making
cholera|63650001
a zoonotic disease.|64572001

When
consumed
most bacteria|409822003
do
not
survive
the acidic conditions|34957004|260905004
of the human stomach.|278412004|69695003|278412004|181246003

The few surviving bacteria|57176003|409822003
conserve
their energy|248272003
and
stored nutrients|440276004|226355009
during the passage|255592004
through the stomach|69695003|181246003
by shutting
down much protein production.|88878007

When
the surviving bacteria|409822003
exit|5173006
the stomach|69695003|181246003
and
reach|282679008
the small intestine|264196002|181250005
they
need|410525008|103325001
to
propel
themselves
through the thick mucus|246703001|49909006
that lines|50009006
the small intestine to|264196002|181250005
get
to the intestinal walls|360972004
where they
can
thrive.

_V.

cholerae_ bacteria start up production|63650001|409822003|255395001|255532002|63650001|409822003|255395001|353734004
of the hollow cylindrical protein flagellin to|255347005|45226003|88878007|428466008
make
flagella,|62300007
the cork-screw helical fibers|13818007|68183006|13732004|400293002|13818007|68183006|13732004|37202001|13818007|68183006|86153000|400293002|13818007|68183006|86153000|37202001|223794004|68183006|13732004|400293002|223794004|68183006|13732004|37202001|223794004|68183006|86153000|400293002|223794004|68183006|86153000|37202001
they
rotate|263861005
to
propel
themselves
through the mucus|49909006
of the small intestine.|264196002|181250005

Once the cholera bacteria|63650001|409822003
reach|282679008
the intestinal wall|360972004
they no longer|255511005
need|410525008|103325001
the flagella to|62300007
move.|302000008|384598002|370125004

The bacteria stop|409822003|422117008
producing
the protein flagellin to|88878007|428466008
conserve
energy|248272003
and
nutrients|226355009
by changing|243326001|263703002
the mix|26242008|421826007
of proteins|88878007
which they
express
in response
to the changed chemical surroundings.|243326001|441900009|355648006|263703002|441900009|355648006

On reaching|282679008
the intestinal wall _V.|360972004

cholerae_ start|63650001|255395001
producing
the toxic proteins|88878007
that
give|419582001
the infected person|125676002
a watery diarrhea.|263930000|398032003

This
carries|288345009
the multiplying new generations|421206002|7147002
of _V.

cholerae_ bacteria out|63650001|409822003
into the drinking water|160573003|11713004|160573003|119318008|30953006|11713004|30953006|119318008
of the next|18769003|255260001
host
if proper sanitation measures|246445000|367346004
are
not
in place.|257557008|421066005

The cholera toxin|255821009
(CTX
or
CT
)
is
an oligomeric complex|103360007
made up|255532002|353734004
of six protein subunits|422218008|88878007
:
a single copy|125681006|50607009
of the
A subunit
(part A|260726005
)
,
and
five copies|421820001
of the B subunit
(part B|260726005
)
,
connected
by a disulfide bond.

The five B subunits|421820001
form|246176004
a five-membered ring|421820001|394852005|112627000|421820001|394852005|257380004
that
binds|257768005
to GM1 gangliosides|64416009
on the surface|410678000
of the intestinal epithelium cells.|72517000|4421005|266135004|4421005

The A1 portion|260726005
of the
A subunit
is
an enzyme|90668006
that
ADP-ribosylates
G proteins,|22185007
while
the A2 chain fits|46666003|46666003|91175000
into the central pore|26216008
of the B subunit ring.|112627000|257380004

Upon binding,|257768005
the complex|103360007
is
taken|419652001
into the cell|4421005|362837007
via receptor-mediated endocytosis.|116647005|73510009

Once
inside the cell,|4421005|362837007
the disulfide bond
is
reduced,|260400001
and
the A1 subunit
is
freed to|37837009
bind|257768005
with a human partner protein|278412004|262043009|88878007
called
ADP-ribosylation factor 6 (Arf6).

Binding exposes|257768005
its active site,|55561003|10546003
allowing
it to permanently
ribosylate
the Gs alpha subunit|103027002|115486005
of the heterotrimeric G protein.|22185007

This results|394617004
in constitutive cAMP production,
which in turn|282987006
leads|88488004|236874000
to secretion|46242002
of H2O,
Na+,|385432009
K+,
Cl?,
and
HCO3?|68615006|88645003
into the lumen|113342003|342806003|398252006
of the small intestine|264196002|181250005
and
rapid dehydration.|255358001|34095006

The gene|67271001
encoding

called
CTXf
or
CTX?.

Microbiologists|159138004
have
studied|110465008|224699009
the genetic mechanisms|3950001|257544000|255395001|257544000
by which
the _V.

cholerae_ bacteria turn off|63650001|409822003|282987006
the production
of some proteins|88878007
and
turn on|282987006
the production
of other proteins|74964007|88878007
as
they
respond
to the series|13039001
of chemical environments|441900009|276339004
they
encounter
,
passing
through the stomach,|69695003|181246003
through the mucous layer|49909006|255433005
of the small intestine,|264196002|181250005
and
on
to the intestinal wall.|360972004

Of particular interest|225469004
have
been
the genetic mechanisms|3950001|257544000|255395001|257544000
by which cholera bacteria turn on|63650001|409822003|282987006
the protein production|88878007
of the toxins|80917008
that
interact
with host cell mechanisms to|4421005|257544000|362837007|257544000
pump|44668000
chloride ions
into the small intestine,|264196002|181250005
creating
an ionic pressure|48006008|279046003|48006008|13543005|48006008|257893003
which
prevents|116699007
sodium ions|39972003|48006008
from entering|417985001
the cell.|4421005|362837007

The chloride|50213009
and
sodium ions|39972003|48006008
create
a salt-water environment|46031004|276339004
in the small intestines,|264196002
which
through osmosis|47410001
can
pull up|303370007|255532002|303370007|353734004
to six|422218008
litres|258770004
of water|11713004|119318008
per day|258703001|259032004
through the intestinal cells,|261093006|4421005
creating
the massive amounts|46998006|107651007
of diarrhea.|398032003

The host
can
become
rapidly|418694008
dehydrated|34095006
if
an appropriate mixture|272163001
of dilute salt water|421399004|46031004
and
sugar|2331003|74801000

_
that
would
not naturally
produce
the protein toxins,|88878007|80917008
researchers
have
investigated|116698004
the mechanisms|257544000
by which _V.

cholerae_|63650001
responds
to the changing chemical environments|243326001|441900009|276339004|263703002|441900009|276339004
of the stomach,|69695003|181246003
mucous layers,|49909006|255433005
and
intestinal wall.|360972004

Researchers
have
discovered
a complex cascade|103360007
of regulatory proteins|88878007
controls|54776003|31509003
expression|10012005
of _V.

cholerae_ virulence determinants.|63650001

In
responding
to the chemical environment|441900009|276339004
at the intestinal wall,|360972004
the _V.

cholerae_ bacteria|63650001|409822003
produce
the TcpP/TcpH proteins,|88878007
which,
together with the ToxR/ToxS proteins,|88878007
activate
the expression|10012005
of the ToxT regulatory protein.|88878007

ToxT then directly
activates
expression|10012005
of virulence genes|67271001
that
produce
the toxins,|80917008
causing|23981006
diarrhea|398032003
in the infected person|125676002
and
allowing
the bacteria to|409822003
colonize
the intestine.|261093006

Current research|15240007
aims
at discovering "
the signal
that
makes
the cholera bacteria stop swimming|63650001|409822003|422117008|20461001

of the pandemic isolates|46651001
of _V.

cholerae_|63650001
has
revealed variation|263857004|40885006
in the genetic structure.|263767004

Two clusters|420797005
have
been
identified|7882003
:
Cluster I|42146005|22971001
and
Cluster II.

For the most part,|4757001|260726005
Cluster I|42146005|22971001
consists
of strains|48532005|276768000
from the 1960s
and
1970s,
while
Cluster II largely
contains|42504009
strains|48532005|276768000
from the 1980s
and
1990s,
based|418836005
on the change|243326001|263703002
in the clone structure.|47308002

This grouping
of strains|48532005|276768000
is
best|20572008|3442003
seen
in the strains|48532005|276768000
from the African continent.[15]|413464008|261001000|413464008|223497007

A rapid dip-stick test|255358001|272187004|269814003|255358001|272187004|255358001|272187004|272393004
is
available to|103328004
determine
the presence|386397008
of _V.

cholerae_.|63650001

In those samples|123038009
that
test|269814003|272393004
positive,|258758003|10828004
further testing|46053002|46053002|272393004
should
be
done
to
determine
antibiotic resistance.|255631004|30714006

In epidemic situations,
a clinical diagnosis|39154008
may
be
made
by taking
a patient history|116154003|116154003|392521001
and
doing
a brief examination.|359530003|5880005|359535008|5880005

Treatment|276239002|416118004
is
usually
started|385652002
without
or
before confirmation|74996004
by laboratory analysis.|261904005|272389005

Stool|39477002
and
swab samples|257261003|123038009|285570007|123038009|408098004|123038009
collected
in the acute stage|272118002|21191007|272118002|371508000|272118002|261612004
of the disease,|64572001

been
administered|418283001
,
are
the most useful specimens|4757001|123038009
for laboratory diagnosis.|46159000

If
an epidemic
of cholera|63650001
is
suspected,|415684004
the most common causative agent|4757001|72906007|362944004
is
_V.

cholerae_ O1.|63650001

If
_V.

cholerae_ serogroup O1|63650001|262012002
is
not
isolated|46651001
,
the laboratory|261904005
should
test|269814003|272393004
for _V.

cholerae_ O139.|63650001|261701009

However,
if
neither
of these organisms|410653004
is
isolated,|46651001
it
is
necessary to
send
stool specimens|119339001
to a reference laboratory.|415259005

Infection
with _V.

cholerae_ O139|63650001|261701009
should
be
reported|229059009|223458004
and
handled
in the same manner|262126009
as that
caused|23981006|134198009
by _V.

cholerae_ O1.|63650001

The associated diarrheal illness|47429007|398032003|39104002
should
be
referred|439980006
to
as
cholera|63650001
and
must
be
reported|229059009|223458004
in the United States.[16]|223688001

A number|410680006|410681005
of special media|67995009|61695000
have
been
employed|224363007
for the cultivation
for cholera vibrios.|75953000

They
are
classified|73504009
as
follows|367409002
:

Direct microscopy|164839006
of stool|39477002
is
not
recommended
,
as
it
is
unreliable.

Microscopy|117259009
is
preferred only|225773000
after
enrichment,
as
this process|415178003
reveals|263857004
the characteristic motility|398598008
of _Vibrio_|34872001
and
its inhibition|61511001|419495008
by appropriate antisera.|398655004

Diagnosis|439401001
can
be
confirmed|59156000
,
as well as
serotyping|258075003
done
by agglutination|82383000
with specific sera.|69658003|67922002

Although
cholera|63650001
may
be
life-threatening, prevention|224130005|169443000
of the disease|64572001
is
normally
straightforward|385666007
if proper sanitation practices
are
followed.|367409002

In developed countries,|223369002
due to nearly universal advanced water treatment|73548004|86005002|11713004|276239002|73548004|86005002|11713004|416118004|73548004|86005002|119318008|276239002|73548004|86005002|119318008|416118004
and
sanitation practices,
cholera|63650001
is
no longer|255511005
a major health threat.|255603008|263775005

The last major outbreak|255603008|443684005
of cholera|63650001
in the United States|223688001
occurred|272120004
in 1910?1911.

Effective sanitation practices,|255403003|254648000
if
instituted|385437003
and
adhered|102491009
to
in time,|410669006
are
usually sufficient to|51117008
stop|422117008
an epidemic.

There
are
several points|261028005
along the cholera transmission path|63650001|258150004
at which
its spread|410677005
may
be
halted
:

Surveillance|225419007
and
prompt reporting|223458004
allow
for containing cholera epidemics rapidly.|42504009|63650001|418694008

Cholera|63650001
exists
as a seasonal disease|21864008|64572001
in many endemic countries,|223369002
occurring|272120004
annually mostly|53281000
during rainy seasons.|21864008

Surveillance systems|225419007|246333005
can
provide
early|264499004
alerts|248221007
to outbreaks,|443684005
therefore
leading|236874000
to coordinated response|162258009
and
assist|116697009|119265000
in preparation|225106003
of preparedness plans.|406205008|52713000|406205008|397943006

Efficient surveillance systems|260375008|225419007|246333005
can
also
improve|385425000|3442003|385633008
the risk assessment|225338004
for potential cholera outbreaks.|30207005|63650001|443684005

Understanding|66216009
the seasonality|21864008
and
location|246267002
of outbreaks|443684005
provide
guidance|420227002
for improving cholera control activities|385633008|63650001|31509003|257733005
for the most vulnerable.|4757001

For prevention to|169443000
be
effective,|255403003|254648000
it
is
important
that cases|398241000|413769002
are
reported|229059009|223458004

to glucose-based ones|67079006|421379005|67079006|418836005|421379005|72191006|421379005|72191006|418836005|421379005
due to greater efficiency.|263768009|260375008

In severe cases|24484000|398241000|24484000|413769002
with significant dehydration,|386134007|34095006
intravenous rehydration|243221009|255560000|243221009
may
be
necessary.

Ringer's lactate|347379006
is
the preferred solution,|225773000|8537005|225773000|77899000
often|70232002
with added potassium.|88480006

Large volumes|255509001|118565006
and
continued replacement|255238004|3137001|255238004|282089006
until diarrhea|398032003
has
subsided
may
be
needed.|410525008|103325001

Ten percent|23067006|118582008|420258001|118582008
of a person's body weight|125676002|27113001|125676002|39857003
in fluid|32457005|33463005|255765007
may
need|410525008|103325001
to
be
given|419582001
in the first two|255216001|420797005|232714002|420797005
to four hours.|421534005|258702006

This method|260686004|272394005
was
first|255216001|232714002
tried
on a mass scale|300848003|19892000|300848003|278111002|118538004|19892000|118538004|278111002
during the Bangladesh Liberation War,|223598004
and
was
found|404684003
to
have
much success.[26]|385669000

If
commercially
produced
oral rehydration solutions|409585005
are
too expensive
or
difficult to|52925006
obtain|398092000
,
solutions|8537005
can
be
made.

One|421379005
such recipe calls
for 1 litre|260305007|258770004
of boiled water,|255625002
1/2 teaspoon|303183002|415703001
of salt,|387390002
6 teaspoons|415703001
of sugar,|2331003|74801000
and
added
mashed banana|256307007|411729008
for potassium|88480006
and
to
improve|385425000|3442003|385633008
taste.[27]|76489005

As
there frequently|70232002
is
initially acidosis,|884001|51387008
the potassium level|365760004
may
be
normal, even|17621005|258744000
though
large losses|255509001
have
occurred.|272120004

As the dehydration|34095006
is
corrected,|370975003
potassium levels|365760004
may
decrease|260400001|260370003
rapidly,|418694008
and
thus
need|410525008|103325001
to
be
replaced.[1]|282089006|370124000

Antibiotic treatments|255631004|276239002
for one|421379005
to three days|421291004|258703001
shorten|129350004|359530003
the course|288524001
of the disease|64572001
and
reduce|260400001
the severity|272141005
of the symptoms.

People|125676002
will
recover|74822006
without them,
however,
if
sufficient hydration|51117008|405006006
is
maintained.|385630006

Doxycycline|372478003
is
typically
used|394850002
first line,|255216001|50009006|232714002|50009006
although
some
strains|48532005|276768000
of _V.

cholerae_|63650001
have
shown
resistance.|30714006

Testing|272393004
for resistance|30714006
during an outbreak|443684005
can
help
determine
appropriate future choices.

Other antibiotics|74964007|255631004
proven|277025001
to
be
effective|255403003|254648000

tetracycline,|372809001|16355005|282831004
chloramphenicol,|372777009
and
furazolidone.|416556006

Fluoroquinolones,
such as norfloxacin,|387271008
also
may
be
used|394850002
,
but
resistance|30714006
has
been
reported.[29]|229059009|223458004

In many areas|42798000
of the world,
antibiotic resistance|255631004|30714006
is
increasing.|260369004

In Bangladesh,|223598004
for example,
most cases|398241000|413769002
are
resistant|30714006
to tetracycline,|372809001|16355005|282831004
trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole,|398731002

cheap
method to|260686004|272394005

cholera_|63650001
is
the practice
of folding|10942006
a sari|262129002|313371000
(a long fabric garment|255511005|256245006|272180002
)
multiple times to|260396001|410669006|260396001|417929005

to eight times|421825006|410669006|421825006|417929005
may
create
a simple filter to|13673007|116250002|13673007|258648006

is
imperative,
as

cholera_-associated disease.|63650001|47429007|64572001

If people|125676002
with cholera|63650001
are
treated|28995006
quickly
and
properly,
the mortality rate|409651001
is
less
than 1%|260305007
;
however,
with untreated cholera,|25265005|63650001
the mortality rate|409651001
rises
to 50?60%.

For certain genetic strains|17162000|3950001|48532005|17162000|3950001|276768000|17162000|255395001|48532005|17162000|255395001|276768000
of cholera,|63650001
such as the one present|421379005|52101004|421379005|246105001
during the 2010 epidemic
in Haiti|223705008
and
the 2004 outbreak|443684005
in India,|223600005
death|419620001|268923008
can
occur|272120004
within two hours|420797005|258702006
of
becoming
ill.[36]|367391008

Cholera|63650001
affects|4065008
an estimated 3-5 million people worldwide,|414135002|125676002
and
causes|134198009
100,000-130,000 deaths|419620001|268923008
a year|258707000|259039008
as of 2010.

This
occurs|272120004
mainly
in the developing world.

In the early 1980s,|264499004
death rates|409651001
are
believed
to
have
been
greater|263768009
than 3 million|260313008
a year.|258707000|259039008

It
is
difficult to|52925006
calculate|258090004
exact numbers|410680006|410681005
of cases,|398241000|413769002
as
many
go
unreported
due to
concerns
that
an outbreak|443684005
may
have
a negative impact|260385009|134293005
on the tourism
of a country.|223369002

Cholera remains|63650001
both
epidemic
and
endemic
in many areas|42798000
of the world.[1]

Although
much
is
known|36692007
about the mechanisms|257544000
behind the
spread|410677005
of cholera,|63650001
this
has
not
led|88488004|236874000
to a full understanding|261015003|66216009
of what
makes
cholera outbreaks happen|63650001|443684005
some
places|257557008
and
not others.

Lack|41277001
of treatment|276239002|416118004
of human feces|278412004|39477002
and
lack|41277001
of treatment|276239002|416118004
of drinking water greatly|160573003|11713004|160573003|119318008|30953006|11713004|30953006|119318008
facilitate
its spread,|410677005
but
bodies|279495008|123037004
of water|11713004|119318008
can
serve
as a reservoir,|257687008
and
seafood|44027008
shipped|224673002
long distances|255511005|246132006
can
spread|410677005
the disease.|64572001

Cholera|63650001
was
not
known|36692007
in the Americas
for most
of the 20th century,
but
it
reappeared
towards the end|261782000|422117008
of
that century
and
seems
likely to|2931005
persist.[38]|264670000

The word cholera|255373000|63650001
is
from Greek|1451003
: ??????
_kholera_
from ????
_khol?_ "bile".|70150004

Cholera likely|63650001|2931005
has
its origins|255395001
in the Indian Subcontinent|223506007
;
it
has
been
prevalent
in the Ganges delta|261003002
since
ancient times.|410669006|417929005

The disease first|64572001|255216001|64572001|232714002
spread|410677005
by trade routes
(land|224718008
and
sea|225742004
)
to Russia|223656009
in 1817,
then
to the rest|258157001
of Europe,|223502009
and
from Europe|223502009
to North America.|223503004

Seven cholera pandemics|420359007|63650001
have
occurred|272120004
in the past 200 years,|410513005|258707000
with the seventh originating|86777004
in Indonesia|223589002
in 1961.[39]

The first cholera pandemic|255216001|63650001|232714002|63650001
occurred|272120004
in the Bengal region|261701009|410673009
of India starting|223600005|255395001|223600005|385652002
in 1817
through 1824.

The disease|64572001
dispersed|86902002
from India|223600005
to Southeast Asia,|223585008
China,|223581004
Japan,|223583001
the Middle East,|223605000
and
southern Russia.|223656009

The second pandemic|81170007|257997001|288495006
lasted
from 1827
to 1835
and
affected|247591002|248448006
the United States|223688001
and
Europe.|223502009

The third pandemic|70905002
erupted
in 1839,
persisted
until 1856,
extended|255536004|288467006|255590007
to North Africa,|223498002
and
reached South America,|282679008|223504005
for the first time specifically|255216001|410669006|232714002|410669006
infringing
upon Brazil.|223715002

Cholera|63650001
hit|30166007
the sub-Saharan African region|261089000|413464008|410673009|118555000|413464008|410673009
during the fourth pandemic|29970001
from 1863
to 1875.

The fifth|32088001
and
sixth pandemics|53046009
raged
from 1881?1896
and
1899-1923.

These epidemics
were
less fatal|276139006|399166001|263796003|399166001
due to a greater understanding|263768009|66216009
of the cholera bacteria.|63650001|409822003

Egypt,|223511009
the Arabian peninsula,
Persia,
India,|223600005
and
the Philippines|223592003
were
hit hardest|30166007|72505002
during these epidemics,
while
other areas,|74964007|42798000
like Germany|223637004
in 1892
and
Naples
from 1910?1911,
experienced
severe outbreaks.|24484000|443684005

The final pandemic|42796001
originated
in 1961
in Indonesia|223589002
and
is
marked|46998006
by the emergence
of a new strain,|7147002|48532005|7147002|276768000
nicknamed El Tor,|261780008
which still
persists
today
in developing countries.[40]|223369002|259031006

From a local disease,|74217003
cholera|63650001
became
one|421379005
of the most widespread|4757001|85333001
and
deadly diseases|64572001
of the 19th century,
killing|248007002
an estimated tens|414135002
of millions
of people.|125676002

In Russia|223656009
alone,|105529008
between 1847
and
1851,
more
than one million people|421379005|125676002
perished
of the disease.|64572001

It
killed 150,000 Americans|248007002
during the second pandemic.|81170007|257997001|288495006

Between 1900
and
1920,
perhaps eight million people|421825006|125676002
died|419620001|419099009
of cholera|63650001
in India.[44]|223600005

Cholera|63650001
became
the first reportable disease|255216001|229059009|64572001|255216001|223458004|64572001|232714002|229059009|64572001|232714002|223458004|64572001
in the United States|223688001
due to the significant effects|386134007|253861007
it
had
on health.|263775005

John Snow,|387085005|263874004
in England,|223664003
was
the first to|255216001|232714002
identify|7882003
the importance
of contaminated water|102414000
in its cause|134198009
in 1854.

Cholera|63650001
is
now
no longer|255511005
considered
a pressing health threat|263775005
in Europe|223502009
and
North America|223503004
due to filtering|116250002|258648006
and
chlorination
of water supplies,|11713004|425398004|119318008|425398004
but
still heavily
affects|4065008
populations|385436007
in developing countries.|223369002

In the past,|410513005
people traveling|125676002|420008001
in ships|224673002
would
hang
a yellow quarantine flag|263935005|170499009
if
one|421379005
or
more
of the crew members|394852005
suffered
from cholera.|63650001

Passengers|257500003
from boats|257418003
with a yellow flag hung|263935005
would
not
be
allowed
to
disembark
at any harbor|257621007
for an extended period,|255536004|259037005|288467006|259037005|255590007|259037005
typically 30
to 40 days.|259031006|258703001

In modern international maritime signal flags,
the quarantine flag|170499009
is
yellow|263935005
and
black.|315240009|413464008|15086000|371252007

The term _cholera morbus_|63650001
was
used|394850002
in the 19th
and
early 20th centuries to|264499004
describe
both
nonepidemic cholera|63650001
and
other gastrointestinal diseases|74964007|119292006
(sometimes
epidemic
)
that resembled cholera.|63650001

The term
is
not
in current use,|15240007|277889008|15240007|419385000
but
is
found|404684003
in many older references.|70753007

The other diseases|74964007|64572001
are
now
known|36692007
collectively
as
gastroenteritis.|25374005

The Russian-born bacteriologist Waldemar Haffkine|297514005|18537005|85163001|18537005
developed
the first cholera vaccine|255216001|396422009|232714002|396422009
around 1900.

The bacterium|409822003
had
been
originally
isolated|46651001
45 years|258707000
earlier|264499004
(1855
)
by Italian anatomist Filippo Pacini,|297502002|112246007|31637002|112246007
but
its exact nature|277302009
and
his results|394617004
were
not widely
known.|36692007

One|421379005
of the major contributions|255603008
to fighting cholera|248005005|63650001
was
made
by the physician|309343006
and
pioneer medical scientist John Snow|74188005|308027003|387085005|74188005|308027003|263874004
(1813?1858
)
,
who
in 1854
found|404684003
a link
between cholera|63650001
and
contaminated drinking water.|102414000|160573003|102414000|30953006

Dr.|309343006

Snow|387085005|263874004
proposed
a microbial origin|255395001
for epidemic cholera|63650001
in 1849.

In his major "state of the art" review|255603008|398070004
of 1855,
he
proposed
a substantially
complete|255594003
and
correct model
for the etiology|134198009
of the disease.|64572001

In two pioneering epidemiological field studies,|420797005|255798002|110465008|420797005|255798002|224699009
he
was
able to|371150009
demonstrate
human sewage contamination|278412004|224939005
was
the most probable disease vector|4757001|2931005|64572001|260529001
in two major epidemics|420797005|255603008
in London
in 1854.

His model
was
not immediately|49499008
accepted|385645004
,
but
it
was
seen
to
be
the more plausible,|242762006
as
medical microbiology|14698002|394820005
developed
over the next 30 years|18769003|258707000|255260001|258707000
or
so.|223528007

Cities|284560003
in developed nations
made
massive investment|46998006
in clean water supply|11713004|425398004|119318008|425398004
and
well-separated sewage treatment infrastructures|20572008|13184001|224939005|276239002|20572008|13184001|224939005|416118004|20572008|263869007|224939005|276239002|20572008|263869007|224939005|416118004
between the mid-1850s|255562008
and
the 1900s.

This eliminated
the threat
of cholera epidemics|63650001
from the major developed cities|255603008|284560003
in the world.

In 1883,
Robert Koch
identified|7882003
_V.

cholerae_|63650001
with a microscope|65473004
as the bacillus|44762009|1017006
causing|23981006
the disease.[49]|64572001

Cholera|63650001
has
been
a laboratory|261904005
for the study|110465008|224699009
of evolution
of virulence.

The province
of Bengal|261701009
in British India|223600005
was
partitioned
into West Bengal|261701009
and
East Pakistan|223603007
in 1947.

Prior to partition,
both
regions|410673009
had
cholera pathogens|63650001|264418008
with similar characteristics.

After 1947,
India|223600005
made
more
progress|385651009
on public health|310115006
than East Pakistan|223603007
(now Bangladesh.|223598004

As a consequence,|103332005
_[clarification
needed|410525008|103325001
_]
the strains|48532005|276768000
of the pathogen|264418008
that
succeeded
in India|223600005
had
a greater incentive|263768009
in the longevity|111951006
of the host.

They
have
become
less virulent|276139006|263796003
than the strains|48532005|276768000
prevailing
in Bangladesh.|223598004

These
draw
upon the resources
of the host population|385436007|389109008
and
rapidly|418694008
kill|248007002
many victims.

More recently,|242762006|6493001
in 2002,
Alam,
_
et
al._,
studied stool samples|119339001
from patients|116154003
at the International Centre|26216008
for Diarrhoeal Disease|128333008
in Dhaka,
Bangladesh.|223598004

From the various experiments|256220008
they
conducted|844005
,
the researchers
found|404684003
a correlation
between the passage|255592004
of _V.

cholerae_|63650001
through the human digestive system|278412004|86762007|278412004|278859004
and
an increased infectivity state.|35105006|398070004|260366006|398070004

Furthermore,
the researchers
found|404684003
the bacterium|409822003
creates
a hyperinfected state|398070004
where genes|67271001
that
control|31509003
biosynthesis|11798007
of amino acids,|52518006
iron uptake systems,|3829006|258763004|246333005
and
formation|11798007|255277001
of periplasmic nitrate reductase complexes|17708005|103360007
were
induced|16404004
just
before
defecation.|111989001

These induced characteristics|16404004
allow
the cholera vibrios to|75953000
survive
in the "rice water" stools,|18425006
an environment|276339004
of limited oxygen|255469002|24099007
and
iron,|3829006
of patients|116154003
with a cholera infection.[50]|63650001

Other famous people|74964007|125676002

to
