*Anthrax|409498004
*
*
is
an acute disease|2704003
caused|23981006|134198009
by the bacterium _Bacillus anthracis_.|409822003|21927003

Most
forms|246176004
of the disease|64572001
are
lethal,
and
it
affects|4065008
both
humans|278412004
and
animals.|387961004

There
are
effective vaccines|255403003|398827000|254648000|398827000
against anthrax,|409498004
and
some
forms|246176004
of the disease|64572001
respond
well|20572008
to antibiotic treatment.|255631004|276239002|255631004|416118004

Like many other members|74964007|394852005
of the genus _Bacillus_,|44762009
_Bacillus anthracis_|21927003
can
form|246176004
dormant endospores|46994008
(often|70232002
referred to|439980006
as
"spores"|263883009
for short,|359530003|367450005
but
not to
be
confused|286933003
with fungal spores|46901008
that
are
able to|371150009
survive
in harsh|76412005
conditions|78326006|260905004
for decades
or
even centuries.

Such spores|263883009
can
be
found|404684003
on all continents,|223497007
even Antarctica.|223499005

When
spores|263883009
are
inhaled|14910006
,
ingested|111984006
,
or
come
into contact|11723008|70862002
with a skin lesion|95324001
on a host,
they
may
become
reactivated|59086009
and
multiply rapidly.|421206002|418694008

Anthrax commonly|409498004
infects
wild|262290003
and
domesticated herbivorous mammals|284730005|387976007
that
ingest|111984006
or
inhale|421134003
the spores|263883009
while
grazing.|262536007

Ingestion|111984006
is
thought to|88952004
be
the most common route|4757001|72906007|284009009|4757001|72906007
by which
herbivores|284730005
contract anthrax.|409498004

Carnivores|388071002
living|224130005|419749002
in the same environment|262126009|276339004
may
become
infected
by consuming infected animals.|387961004

Diseased animals|64572001|387961004
can
spread|410677005
anthrax|409498004
to humans,|278412004
either
by direct contact|255589003|11723008|255589003|70862002
(
e.g.
,
inoculation
of infected blood|87612001|119273009
to broken skin|7919002
)
or
by consumption
of a diseased animal's flesh.|64572001|387961004

Anthrax spores|409498004|263883009
can
be
produced
_
in vitro_
and
used|394850002
as a biological weapon.

Anthrax|409498004
does
not
spread|410677005
directly
from one infected animal|421379005|387961004
or
person|125676002
to another
;
it
is
spread|410677005
by spores.|263883009

These spores|263883009
can
be
transported|57188001|360300001
by clothing|272180002
or
shoes.|43983001

The body|279495008|123037004
of an animal|387961004
that
had
active anthrax|55561003|409498004
at the time|410669006
of death|419620001|268923008
can
also
be
a source|260753009
of anthrax spores.|409498004|263883009

Until the twentieth century,
anthrax infections|409498004
killed|248007002
hundreds
of thousands
of animals|387961004
and
people|125676002
each year worldwide,|258707000|259039008
particularly
in concentration camps|82742001
during WWII.

French scientist Louis Pasteur|19434008|308027003
developed
the first effective vaccine|255216001|255403003|398827000|255216001|254648000|398827000|232714002|255403003|398827000|232714002|254648000|398827000
for anthrax|409498004
in 1881.

Thanks
to over|21481007
a century
of animal vaccination programs,|387961004
sterilization
of raw animal waste materials,|6304003|387961004|289925000

Europe,|223502009
and
parts|260726005
of Africa|223498002
and
Asia,|223500001
anthrax infection|409498004
is
now relatively rare|84638005|103356009
in domestic animals
(
with only|50607009|420295001
a few dozen cases|57176003|398241000|57176003|413769002
reported|229059009|223458004
every year|258707000|259039008
)._[citation
needed|410525008|103325001
_] Anthrax|409498004
is
especially rare|84638005|103356009
in dogs|448771007
and
cats,|448169003|388618001
as is
evidenced|18669006
by a single reported case|125681006|229059009|398241000|125681006|223458004|398241000|50607009|229059009|398241000|50607009|223458004|398241000
in the USA|223688001
in 2001.

Anthrax typically|409498004
does
not
cause|23981006|134198009
disease|64572001
in carnivores|388071002
and
scavengers,
even
when
these animals|387961004
consume
anthrax-infected carcasses.|409498004|127853004

Anthrax outbreaks|409498004|443684005
do
occur|272120004
in some wild animal populations|262290003|387961004|385436007
with some regularity.|17854005|246202005

The disease|64572001
is
more common|242762006|72906007
in developing countries|223369002
without widespread veterinary|85333001|53216000
or
human public health programs.|278412004|310115006

_Bacillus anthracis_ bacterial spores|21927003|46994008
are
soil-borne,|415555003|106970005|415555003|81827009|415555003|398209006
and
,
because of their long lifetime,|255511005
they
are
still
present|52101004|246105001
globally
and
at animal burial sites|387961004|52373005|10546003
of anthrax-killed animals|409498004|248007002|387961004
for many decades
;
spores|263883009
have
been
known|36692007
to
have
reinfected animals|255230006|387961004
over 70 years|258707000
after burial sites|52373005|10546003
of anthrax-infected animals|409498004|387961004
were
disturbed.[9]

Respiratory infection|275498002
in humans initially|278412004|884001
presents|52101004|246105001
with cold|285686007|82272006|84162001
or
flu-like symptoms|315642008
for several days,|261028005|258703001
followed|367409002
by severe|24484000
(
and
often fatal|70232002|399166001
)
respiratory collapse.|258162000|27942005|258162000|16277007|258162000|271787007|449071006|27942005|449071006|16277007|449071006|271787007

Historical mortality|409651001|392521001|409651001
was
92%,
but
,
when
treated|28995006
early|264499004
(
seen
in the 2001 anthrax attacks,|409498004|216299002
observed mortality|409651001
was
45%.

Distinguishing
pulmonary anthrax|11389007
from more common causes|242762006|72906007|134198009
of respiratory illness|258162000|39104002|449071006|39104002
is
essential|34325006
to avoiding delays
in diagnosis|439401001
and
thereby improving outcomes.|385633008|394617004

An algorithm
for this purpose|363675004
has
been
developed.

Illness progressing|39104002|255314001
to the fulminant phase|21191007
has
a 97% mortality|260309001|409651001|264708004|409651001
regardless of treatment.|276239002|416118004

A lethal infection
is
reported to|229059009|223458004
result|394617004
from inhalation|14910006|422237004
of about 10,000?20,000 spores,|263883009
though
this dose|277406006|408102007
varies
among host species.|69658003

As
with all diseases,|64572001
it
is
presumed
that there
is
a wide variation|90522003|40885006
to susceptibility|76522002|118588007
with evidence|18669006
that
some people|125676002
may
die|419620001|399069006|419099009
from much lower exposures|261122009|71677004|261122009|242575009
;
there
is
little documented evidence to|397934002|18669006
verify
the exact
or
average number|410680006|410681005
of spores|263883009
needed|410525008|103325001
for infection.

Inhalational anthrax|11389007
is
also
known|36692007
as Woolsorters'
or
Ragpickers' disease|64572001
as these professions|14679004
were
more susceptible|242762006|131196009
to the disease|64572001
due to their exposure|71677004|24932003
to infected animal products.|105899005

Other practices|74964007
associated|47429007
with exposure|71677004|24932003
include|55919000
the slicing
up
of animal horns|387961004|69221006
for the manufacture
of buttons,|14339000
the handling
of hair bristles|386045008|119326000
used|394850002
for the manufacturing
of brushes,|994005
and
the handling
of animal skins.|51890009

Whether
these animal skins|51890009
came
from animals|387961004
that
died|419620001|419099009
of the disease|64572001
or
from animals|387961004
that
had
simply
laid
on ground
that
had
spores|263883009
on it
is
unknown.|261665006

This mode
of infection
is
used|394850002
as a bioweapon.

Gastrointestinal infection|128398001
in humans|278412004
is
most often|4757001|70232002
caused|23981006|134198009
by consuming anthrax-infected meat|409498004|28647000
and
is
characterized
by serious gastrointestinal difficulty,|42745003|371157007
vomiting|249497008
of blood,|87612001|119273009
severe diarrhea,|409587002
acute inflammation|4532008
of the intestinal tract,|261093006|361358007
and
loss
of appetite.|33911006

Some lesions
have
been
found|404684003
in the intestines|261093006
and
in the mouth|74262004|123851003|21082005|181220002
and
throat.|54066008|49928004|264231000

After the bacterium|409822003
invades
the bowel system,|261093006|246333005
it
spreads|410677005
through the bloodstream
throughout the body,|279495008|123037004
making
even more toxins|80917008
on the way.

Gastrointestinal infections|128398001
can
be
treated|28995006
but
usually
result|394617004
in fatality rates|399166001
of 25%
to 60%,
depending
upon
how
soon treatment commences.|276239002|416118004

This form|246176004
of anthrax|409498004
is
the rarest form.|84638005|246176004|103356009|246176004

In the United States,|223688001
there
have
only
been
two official cases,|420797005|398241000|420797005|413769002
the first|255216001|232714002
reported|229059009|223458004
in 1942
by the CDC
and
the second|81170007|257997001|288495006
reported|229059009|223458004
in 2010
that
was
treated|28995006
at the Massachusetts General Hospital.|224066008|60132005|224066008|60132005|285201006

It
is
the only known case|50607009|36692007|398241000|420295001|36692007|398241000
of survival
from GI anthrax|409498004
in the U.S.|223688001

Cutaneous|119325001|39937001|181469002
(
on the skin|119325001|39937001|181469002
)
anthrax infection|409498004
in humans|278412004
shows
up
as
a boil-|416675009
like skin lesion|95324001
that eventually
forms|246176004
an ulcer|429040005
with a black center|315240009|26216008|413464008|26216008|15086000|26216008|371252007|26216008
(eschar|87319000
).

The black eschar often|315240009|87319000|70232002|413464008|87319000|70232002|15086000|87319000|70232002|371252007|87319000|70232002
shows
up
as
a large, painless necrotic ulcer|255509001|255350008|6574001|429040005
(beginning|255395001
as an irritating
and
itchy skin lesion|424492005|424492005|95324001
or
blister|408764000|247464001|417237009
that
is
dark|255419005
and
usually
concentrated
as a black dot,|315240009|420987007|413464008|420987007|15086000|420987007|371252007|420987007
somewhat
resembling
bread mold|226559002|84489001
)
at the site|10546003
of infection.

In general, cutaneous infections|60132005|108365000
form|246176004
within the site|10546003
of spore penetration|255811001|53568006|263883009|53568006
between 2|260306008
and
5 days|264706000|258703001|264605009|258703001
after exposure.|71677004|24932003

Unlike bruises|125667009
or
most other lesions,|74964007
cutaneous anthrax infections normally|84980006
do
not
cause|23981006|134198009
pain.[13]|22253000

Cutaneous anthrax|84980006
is
typically
caused|23981006|134198009
when
_Bacillus anthracis_ spores|21927003|263883009
enter|417985001
through cuts|283396008
on the skin.|119325001|39937001|181469002

This form|246176004
of Anthrax|409498004
is
found most commonly|404684003
when
humans|278412004
handle
infected animals|387961004
and/or
animal products|105899005
(
e.g.
,
the hide|421332005
of an animal|387961004
used to|394850002
make
drums
).

Cutaneous anthrax|84980006
is
rarely fatal|103356009|399166001
if
treated|28995006
,
[10]
because
the infection area|42798000
is
limited|255469002
to the skin,|119325001|39937001|181469002
preventing|116699007
the Lethal Factor,|409502006
Edema Factor,|409500003
and
Protective Antigen|409499007
from entering|417985001
and
destroying
a vital organ.|260410005|410653004

Without treatment,|276239002|416118004
about 20%
of cutaneous skin infection cases|108365000|39937001|398241000|108365000|39937001|413769002
progress|385651009
to toxemia|15394000
and
death.|419620001|268923008

_Bacillus anthracis_|21927003
is
a rod-shaped, Gram-positive, aerobic bacterium|17139002|107644003|8745002|27471002|17139002|300842002|8745002|27471002
about 1|260305007
by 9 micrometers|258674000
in length.|410668003

It
was
shown
to
cause|23981006|134198009
disease|64572001
by Robert Koch
in 1876.

The bacterium normally|409822003
rests|258157001
in endospore form|46994008|246176004
in the soil,|415555003
and
can
survive
for decades
in this state.|398070004

Herbivores|284730005
are
often|70232002
infected
whilst
grazing|262536007
or
browsing,
especially
when
eating|48263008
rough, irritant,|412453003|263789000
or
spiky vegetation|264340003
:
the vegetation|264340003
has
been
hypothesized
to
cause|23981006|134198009
wounds|13924000
within the gastrointestinal tract permitting entry|122865005|958006|279972009|958006
of the bacterial endo-spores|46994008|129103003
into the tissues,|85756007
though
this
has
not
been
proven.|277025001

Once
ingested|111984006
or
placed|257557008|421066005
in an open wound,|125643001
the bacterium|409822003
begins|255395001
multiplying|421206002
inside the animal|387961004
or
human|278412004
and
typically
kills|248007002
the host
within a few days|57176003|258703001
or
weeks.|258705008

The endo-spores|129103003|263883009
germinate
at the site|10546003
of entry
into the tissues|85756007
and
then
spread|410677005
via the circulation|413854007
to the lymphatics,|89890002|83555006
where
the bacteria multiply.|409822003|421206002

It
is
the production
of two powerful exo-toxins|420797005|33300005|80917008
and
_lethal toxin_|409647003
by the bacteria|409822003
that
causes|134198009
death.|419620001|268923008

Veterinarians|106290006
can
often|70232002
tell
a possible anthrax-induced death|371930009|409498004|16404004|419620001|371930009|409498004|16404004|268923008|60022001|409498004|16404004|419620001|60022001|409498004|16404004|268923008
by its sudden occurrence,|255363002|272120004
and
by the dark,|255419005
non-clotting blood|75753009
that oozes
from the body orifices.|279495008|264114003|123037004|264114003

Most anthrax bacteria|21927003
inside the body|279495008|123037004
after death|419620001|268923008
are
out-competed|255529000
and
destroyed
by anaerobic bacteria|59343002
within minutes|258701004|255507004|356624006
to hours postmortem.|258702006|168461002

However,
anthrax vegetative bacteria|21927003
that
escape
the body|279495008|123037004
via oozing blood|87612001|119273009
or
through the opening|56116003
of the carcass|127853004
may
form|246176004
hardy spores.|263883009

One spore|421379005|255811001|421379005|263883009
forms|246176004
per one vegetative bacterium.|421379005|409822003

The triggers
for spore formation|255811001|11798007|255811001|255277001|263883009|11798007|263883009|255277001
are
not yet
known|36692007
,
though
oxygen tension|25579001
and
lack|41277001
of nutrients|226355009
may
play|300776002
roles.

Once
formed|35810008
,
these spores|263883009
are
very hard|260358002|72505002
to
eradicate.

The infection
of herbivores|284730005
(
and
occasionally humans|278412004
)
via the inhalational route normally|14910006|284009009|14910006|284009009|284009009|422237004|284009009|422237004
proceeds
as
follows|367409002
:
Once
the spores|263883009
are
inhaled|14910006
,
they
are
transported|57188001|360300001
through the air passages|417696007|255592004
into the tiny air particles sacs|49081009
(alveoli
)
in the lungs.|39607008

The spores|263883009
are
then
picked
up
by scavenger cells|4421005
(macrophages|58986001
in the lungs|39607008
and
are
transported|57188001|360300001
through small vessels|27915009|340264000
(lymphatics|89890002|83555006
to the lymph nodes|59441001
in the central chest cavity|26216008|43799004
(mediastinum.|264099006|94931004|181217005

Damage|37782003
caused|23981006|134198009
by the anthrax spores|409498004|263883009
and
bacilli|44762009|416207009
to the central chest cavity|26216008|43799004
can
cause|23981006|134198009
chest pain|29857009
and
difficulty breathing.|267036007

Once
in the lymph nodes,|59441001
the spores|263883009
germinate
into active bacilli|55561003|44762009|55561003|416207009
that multiply|421206002
and
eventually
burst|255331008
the macrophages,|58986001
releasing|129299003
many more bacilli|242762006|44762009|242762006|416207009
into the bloodstream to
be
transferred|129347002
to the entire body.|255503000|279495008|255503000|123037004|260232004|279495008|260232004|123037004

Once
in the blood stream,|87612001|257709004|119273009|257709004
these bacilli|44762009|416207009
release|58000006|68776005|258760001|129299003|115956009
three proteins|421291004|88878007
named|27468005
_lethal factor_,|409502006
_edema factor_,|409500003
and
_protective antigen_.|409499007

All three|421291004
are
non-toxic
by themselves,
but
the combination|89780004
is
incredibly lethal
to humans.|278412004

Protective antigen|409499007
combines|20909006
with these other two factors to|74964007|420797005
form|246176004
lethal toxin|409647003
and
edema toxin,|423666004|80917008
respectively.

These toxins|80917008
are
the primary agents|63161005|260872001|261424001|260872001
of tissue destruction,|85756007|64597002
bleeding|131148009
,
and
death|419620001|268923008
of the host.

If antibiotics|255631004
are
administered|418283001
too late,|260383002
even
if
the antibiotics|255631004
eradicate
the bacteria,|409822003
some hosts
will
still
die|419620001|399069006|419099009
of toxemia.|15394000

This
is
because
the toxins|80917008
produced
by the bacilli|44762009|416207009
remain
in their system|246333005
at lethal dose levels.|409644005|258395000

The lethality
of the anthrax disease owes|409498004
itself
to the bacterium's two principal virulence factors|409822003|420797005|63161005|409822003|420797005|302311007
:
(i|42146005|22971001
)
the poly-D-glutamic acid capsule,|116712007|85214009|385049006|116712007|85214009|428641000|116712007|104697004|385049006|116712007|104697004|428641000
which
protects
the bacterium|409822003
from phagocytosis|56639005
by host neutrophils,|116712007
and
(ii
)
the tripartite protein toxin,|88878007|80917008
called anthrax toxin.|409498004|80917008

Anthrax toxin|409498004|80917008
is
a mixture|272163001
of three protein components|421291004|88878007|246093002
:
(i|42146005|22971001
)
protective antigen (PA),|409499007
(ii
)
edema factor (EF),|409500003
and
(iii|257471003
)
lethal factor (LF).|409502006

PA
plus
LF
produces
lethal toxin,|409647003
and
PA
plus
EF
produces
edema toxin.|423666004|80917008

These toxins|80917008
cause|23981006|134198009
death|419620001|268923008
and
tissue swelling|85756007|423666004|85756007|442672001
(edema,|423666004
respectively.

In order to
enter|417985001
the cells,|4421005
the edema|423666004
and
lethal factors|409502006
use|277889008|419385000
another protein|88878007
produced
by _B.

anthracis_ called _protective antigen_.|409499007

Protective antigen|409499007
binds|257768005
to
two|420797005
surface receptors|410678000|116647005
on the host cell.|4421005|362837007

A cell protease then|4421005|116536008|362837007|116536008
cleaves|227389000|9094003|58604003
PA
into two fragments|420797005|29140007
:
PA20
and
PA63.

PA20
dissociates
into the extracellular medium,|69320009|255508009
playing|300776002
no further role|46053002
in the toxic cycle.|44180009

PA63 then
oligomerizes
with six other PA63 fragments|422218008|29140007
forming|35810008
a heptameric ring-shaped structure|112627000
named|27468005
a prepore.

Once
in this shape,|107644003|246176004|300842002
the complex|103360007
can
competitively
bind|257768005
up to three EF|421291004
or
LF
forming|35810008
a resistant complex.|30714006|103360007

Receptor-mediated endocytosis|116647005|73510009
occurs|272120004
next,|18769003|255260001
providing
the newly
formed|35810008
toxic complex access|103360007|260507000
to the interior
of the host cell.|4421005|362837007

The acidified environment|276339004
within the endosome
triggers
the heptamer to
release|58000006|68776005|258760001|129299003|115956009
the LF
and/or
EF
into the cytosol.|62035001

It
is
unknown|261665006
how
exactly
the complex results|103360007|394617004
in the death|419620001|268923008
of the cell.|4421005|362837007

Edema factor|409500003
is
a calmodulin-dependent adenylate cyclase.|41649004|371154000|4105008

Adenylate cyclase|4105008
catalyzes
the conversion|272148004
of ATP
into cyclic AMP (cAMP)|84835006
and
pyrophosphate.|312278002

The complexation
of adenylate cyclase|4105008
with calmodulin|41649004
removes|127485006
calmodulin|41649004
from stimulating calcium-triggered signaling,|5540006|38952000|5540006|410658008|38952000
thus
inhibiting|61511001
the immune response.|35024006

To
be
specific, LF|69658003
inactivates
neutrophils|116712007
(
a type|261664005
of phagocytic cell|73568005
)
by the process just|415178003
described
so
that
they
cannot
phagocytose|56639005
bacteria.|409822003

Throughout history,|392521001
it
was
believed
that lethal factor caused macrophages to|409502006|23981006|58986001|409502006|134198009|58986001
make
TNF-alpha|8612007
and
interleukin 1,|116722001|50762005
beta (IL1B).|52095000|260989008

TNF-alpha|8612007
is
a cytokine|75777003
whose primary role|63161005|261424001
is
to
regulate
immune cells|255386009|4421005
as well as
to
induce|16404004
inflammation|257552002
and
apoptosis|20663007
or
programmed cell death.|20663007

Interleukin 1,|116722001|50762005
beta|52095000|260989008
is
another cytokine|75777003
that also
regulates
inflammation|257552002
and
apoptosis.|20663007

The over-production|21481007
of TNF-alpha|8612007
and
IL1B ultimately|116722001|50762005
leads|88488004|236874000
to septic shock|76571007
and
death.|419620001|268923008

However,
recent evidence|6493001|18669006
indicates|410535002
that anthrax also|409498004
targets
endothelial cells|45709008
(cells|4421005
that line serous cavities|50009006|91809009|50009006|304404008
such as the pericardial cavity,|25489000
pleural cavity,|91381003
and
the peritoneal cavity,|181616008|83670000
lymph vessels,|83555006
and
blood vessels|59820001
)
,
causing|23981006
vascular leakage|59820001|76676007
of fluid|32457005|33463005|255765007
and
cells,|4421005
and
ultimately hypovolemic shock|39419009
(low blood volume|62482003|16086006|371880002|16086006
)
,
and
septic shock.|76571007

Occupational exposure|87923000|71677004|87923000|24932003
to infected animals|387961004
or
their products
(
such as skin,|119325001|39937001|181469002
wool,|412161004
and
meat|28647000
)
is
the usual pathway
of exposure|71677004|24932003
for humans.|278412004

Workers|106541005
who
are
exposed|24932003
to dead animals|419620001|387961004
and
animal products|105899005
are
at the highest risk, especially|15508007
in countries|223369002
where anthrax|409498004
is
more common.|242762006|72906007

Anthrax|409498004
in livestock grazing|262536007
on open range|56116003
where they
mix|26242008|421826007
with wild animals still occasionally|262290003|387961004
occurs|272120004
in the United States|223688001
and
elsewhere.

Many workers|260396001|106541005
who
deal
with wool|412161004
and
animal hides|421332005
are
routinely
exposed|24932003
to low levels|62482003|258395000|371880002|258395000
of anthrax spores|409498004|263883009
but
most exposures|71677004|242575009
are
not sufficient to|51117008
develop
anthrax infections.|409498004

It
is
presumed
that
the body's natural defenses|279495008|510009|123037004|510009
can
destroy low levels|62482003|258395000|371880002|258395000
of exposure.|71677004|24932003

These people usually|125676002
contract|78558002
cutaneous anthrax|84980006
if
they catch|30623001
anything.

Throughout history,|392521001
the most dangerous form|4757001|246176004
of inhalational anthrax|11389007
was
called
Woolsorters' disease|11389007
because
it
was
an occupational hazard|17458004
for people|125676002
who
sorted
wool.|412161004

Today
this form|246176004
of infection
is
extremely rare,|84638005|103356009
as
almost
no infected animals|387961004
remain.

The last fatal case|399166001|398241000
of natural inhalational anthrax|510009|11389007
in the United States|223688001
occurred|272120004
in California|224043007|25997004
in 1976,
when
a home weaver|261770009|33372001
died|419620001|419099009
after working|261041009
with infected wool|412161004
imported
from Pakistan.|223603007

The autopsy|168461002
was
done
at UCLA hospital.|285201006

To
minimize
the chance
of
spreading|410677005
the disease,|64572001
the deceased|419620001
was
transported|57188001|360300001
to UCLA
in a sealed plastic body bag|19314006|61088005|279495008|37284003|19314006|61088005|123037004|37284003|106980009|61088005|279495008|37284003|106980009|61088005|123037004|37284003|278420002|61088005|279495008|37284003|278420002|61088005|123037004|37284003
within a sealed metal container.[20]|19314006|425620007|106980009|425620007|278420002|425620007

In November 2008,
a drum maker|308285002
in the United Kingdom|223860005
who
worked|261041009
with untreated animal skins|25265005|51890009
died|419620001|419099009
from anthrax.|409498004

Gastrointestinal anthrax|111798006
is
exceedingly rare|84638005|103356009
in the United States,|223688001
with only one case|50607009|421379005|398241000|420295001|421379005|398241000
on record,
reported|229059009|223458004
in 1942,
according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.|26216008|64572001|31509003|169443000

In December 2009
an outbreak|443684005
of anthrax|409498004
occurred|272120004
amongst heroin addicts|387341002
in Glasgow,
Scotland,|223678002
resulting|42752001
in ten deaths.|23067006|419620001|23067006|268923008|420258001|419620001|420258001|268923008

The source|260753009
of the anthrax|409498004
is
believed to
be
dilution|272390001
of the heroin|387341002
with bone meal|412103003
in Afghanistan.[23]|223597009|264657009

Also
during December 2009,
The New Hampshire Department of Health and Human Services|421753003|263775005|310134006
confirmed|59156000
a case|398241000
of gastrointestinal anthrax|111798006
in an adult female.|224526002

The CDC
investigated|116698004
the source|260753009
and
the possibility
that
it
was
contracted|78558002
from an African drum recently|413464008|6493001
used|394850002
by the woman taking part|224526002|419652001|260726005
in a drumming circle.|354652004

The woman apparently inhaled anthrax [|224526002|14910006|409498004
in spore form]|255811001|246176004|263883009|246176004
from the hide|421332005
of the drum.

She
became
critically ill,|367391008
but
with gastrointestinal anthrax|111798006
rather than
inhaled anthrax,|14910006|409498004
which
made
her unique
in American medical history.|392521001

The building
where the infection
took|419652001
place|257557008|421066005
was
cleaned|228402009
and
reopened
to the public
and
the woman|224526002
recovered.|74822006

Jodie Dionne-Odom,
New Hampshire state epidemiologist,|421753003|398070004
states,|398070004
"
It
is
a mystery.

We really
don't
know|36692007
why
it
happened."[25]

Anthrax|409498004
can
enter|417985001
the human body|279495008|281189005
through the intestines|261093006
(ingestion|111984006
)
,
lungs|39607008
(inhalation|14910006|422237004
)
,
or
skin|119325001|39937001|181469002
(cutaneous|119325001|39937001|181469002
)
and
causes|134198009
distinct clinical symptoms|58147004
based|418836005
on its site|10546003
of entry.

In general,|60132005
an infected human|278412004
will
be
quarantined.|170499009

However,
anthrax|409498004
does
not usually
spread|410677005
from an infected human|278412004
to a noninfected human.|55189008|278412004

But
,
if
the disease|64572001
is
fatal|399166001
to the person's body,|125676002|279495008|125676002|123037004
its mass|300848003|118538004
of anthrax bacilli|21927003
becomes
a potential source|30207005|260753009
of infection
to others|74964007
and
special precautions|67995009
should
be
used|394850002
to
prevent
further contamination.|46053002

Inhalational anthrax,|11389007
if
left|7771000
untreated|25265005
until obvious symptoms
occur|272120004
,
may
be
fatal.|399166001

Anthrax|409498004
can
be
contracted|78558002
in laboratory accidents|52101004|261904005|18720000|261904005
or
by handling infected animals|387961004
or
their wool|412161004
or
hides.|421332005

It
has
also
been
used|394850002
in biological warfare agents
and
by terrorists|257877007
to intentionally
infect
as
exemplified
by the 2001 anthrax attacks.|409498004|216299002

Other than Gram stain|385484003|62777006
of specimens,|123038009
there
are
no specific direct identification techniques|69658003|255589003|286672002|272394005|69658003|255589003|7882003|272394005
for identification|286672002|7882003
of _Bacillus species_|44762009|372377007
in clinical material.|58147004|260769002

These organisms|410653004
are
Gram-positive|258682000|258758003|258682000|10828004
but
with age|424144002
can
be
Gram-variable|258682000|255372005
to Gram-negative.|258682000|260385009

A specific feature|69658003
of _Bacillus species_|44762009|372377007
that
makes
it unique
from other aerobic microorganisms|74964007|27471002|264395009
is
its ability to|371150009
produce
spores.|263883009

Although
spores|263883009
are
not always evident|18669006
on a Gram stain|385484003|62777006
of this organism,|410653004
the presence|386397008
of spores|263883009
confirms|59156000
that
the organism|410653004
is
of the genus _Bacillus_.|44762009

All _Bacillus species_|44762009|372377007
grow
well|20572008
on 5% Sheep blood agar|264706000|409591007|264605009|409591007
and
other routine culture media.|74964007|50811001|421955000

PLET
(polymyxin-lysozyme-EDTA-thallous acetate|373224006|13477003|429850007
)
can
be
used|394850002
to
isolate|46651001
_B.anthracis_|21927003
from contaminated specimens,|62604006|123038009
and
bicarbonate agar|68615006|10249006
is
used|394850002
as an identification method to|398282000
induce|16404004
capsule formation.|385049006|11798007|385049006|255277001|428641000|11798007|428641000|255277001

_Bacillus sp_.|372377007

will
usually
grow
within 24 hours|123027009|259029002
of incubation
at 35 ?C,
in ambient air|417696007
(room temperature|105723007|246508008
)
or
in 5% CO2.|264706000|421982008|264706000|38007001|264605009|421982008|264605009|38007001

If bicarbonate agar|68615006|10249006
is
used|394850002
for identification then|286672002|7882003
the media|61695000
must
be
incubated
in 5% CO2.|264706000|421982008|264706000|38007001|264605009|421982008|264605009|38007001

_B.anthracis_|21927003
appears
as medium-large, gray,|255508009|255509001|229029004|255508009|255509001|371253002
flat,|6041008|257564005
irregular|49608001
with swirling projections,|6349000|260419006
often|70232002
referred to|439980006
as
"medusa head" appearance,|111294009|386548000|111294009|255412001
and
is
non-hemolytic|261993008
on 5% sheep blood agar.|264706000|409591007|264605009|409591007

It
is
non-motile,
is
susceptible|131196009
to penicillin|373270004
and
produces
a wide zone|90522003
of lecithinase|304245003
on egg yolk agar.|62328001|10249006|411684005|10249006

Confirmatory testing to|272393004
identify|7882003
B.anthracis|21927003
includes|55919000
gamma bacteriophage testing,|421416008|67068001|421416008|67068001|272393004

a Biphasic disease|409701001

Vaccines|398827000
against anthrax|409498004
for use|277889008|419385000
in livestock
and
humans|278412004
have
had
a prominent place|4657009|257557008|4657009|421066005
in the history|392521001
of medicine,|410942007
from Pasteur?s
pioneering
19th century work|261041009
with cattle
(
the second effective vaccine ever|81170007|255403003|398827000|81170007|254648000|398827000|257997001|255403003|398827000|257997001|254648000|398827000|288495006|255403003|398827000|288495006|254648000|398827000
)
to the controversial 20th century use|277889008|419385000
of a modern product
(_BioThrax_
)
to
protect
American troops
against the use|277889008|419385000
of anthrax|409498004
in biological warfare.|12893009

Human anthrax vaccines|278412004|396420001
were
developed
by the Soviet Union
in the late 1930s|260383002
and
in the
US
and
UK
in the 1950s.

The current FDA-approved|15240007|9571008
US vaccine|398827000
was
formulated
in the 1960s.

Currently administered human anthrax vaccines|15240007|418283001|278412004|396420001
include|55919000
acellular
(USA|223688001
)
and
live spore|419749002|255811001|419749002|263883009
(Russia|223656009
)
varieties.

All currently used anthrax vaccines|15240007|394850002|396420001
show
considerable local|255470001
and
general reactogenicity|60132005
(erythema,|444827008
induration,|45147008
soreness,|247348008
fever|386661006
and
serious adverse reactions|42745003|281647001
occur|272120004
in about 1%
of recipients.

The American product,
_BioThrax_,
is
licensed
by the FDA
and
was
formerly
administered|418283001
in a six-dose primary series|422218008|277406006|63161005|13039001|422218008|277406006|261424001|13039001|422218008|408102007|63161005|13039001|422218008|408102007|261424001|13039001

with annual boosters to|53281000
maintain|385630006
immunity.|58915005

In 2008,
the FDA
approved|9571008

If
a person|125676002
is
suspected|415684004
as
having
died|419620001|419099009
from anthrax,|409498004
every precaution
should
be
taken|419652001
to
avoid
skin contact|119325001|11723008|119325001|70862002|39937001|11723008|39937001|70862002|181469002|11723008|181469002|70862002

exuded
through natural body openings.|510009|279495008|56116003|510009|123037004|56116003

The body|279495008|123037004
should
be
put
in strict quarantine.|170499009

A blood sample|119297000
taken|419652001
in a sealed container|19314006|106980009|278420002
and
analyzed
in an approved laboratory|9571008|261904005
should
be
used|394850002
to
ascertain
if anthrax|409498004
is
the cause|134198009
of death.|419620001|268923008

Microscopic visualization|84496004
of the encapsulated bacilli,|59135002|44762009|59135002|416207009
usually
in very large numbers,|258262008|410680006|258262008|410681005

is
fully diagnostic,|439401001|261004008
though
culture|252398009|61594008
of the organism|410653004
is
still
the gold standard|2309006|371256005
for diagnosis.|439401001

Full isolation|261015003|40174006|261015003|46651001
of the body|279495008|123037004
is
important to
prevent
possible contamination|371930009|60022001
of others.|74964007

Protective, impermeable clothing|272180002
and
equipment|246137000
such as rubber gloves,|43230003|52291003
rubber apron,|43230003|76433001
and
rubber boots|33482001
with no perforations|263837003
should
be
used|394850002
when
handling
the body.|279495008|123037004

No skin,|119325001|39937001|181469002
especially
if
it
has
any wounds|13924000
or
scratches,|40590001|53181008
should
be
exposed.|24932003

Disposable personal protective equipment|409526008
is
preferable,
but
if
not available, decontamination|103328004|409530006
can
be
achieved
by autoclaving.

Disposable personal protective equipment|409526008
and
filters|116250002
should
be
autoclaved|71948003

is
recommended.

All possibly|60022001
contaminated|62604006
bedding

clothing|272180002
should
be
isolated|46651001
in double plastic bags|1305003|61088005|37284003
and
treated|28995006
as possible bio-hazard waste.|371930009|60022001

The victim

in an airtight body bag.|279495008|37284003|123037004|37284003

Dead victims|419620001
that
are
opened|56116003
and
not
burned|125666000
provide
an ideal source|260753009

attempted
without a fully equipped biohazard laboratory|409595003|261904005
and
trained|118629009|62193008
and
knowledgeable personnel.|225795001

Delays
of only|50607009|420295001
a few days|57176003|258703001
may
make
the disease|64572001
untreatable
and
treatment|276239002|416118004
should
be
started|385652002
even
without symptoms
if
possible contamination|371930009|60022001
or
exposure|71677004|24932003
is
suspected.|415684004

Animals|387961004
with anthrax often just|409498004|70232002
die|419620001|399069006|419099009
without any apparent symptoms.

Initial symptoms|884001|232714002
may
resemble
a common cold?sore throat,|82272006|267102003|54150009|267102003
mild fever,|255604002|386661006
muscle aches|68962001
and
malaise.|367391008

After a few days,|57176003|258703001
the symptoms
may
progress|385651009
to severe breathing problems|24484000|386813002
and
shock|27942005
and
ultimately death.|419620001|268923008

Death|419620001|268923008
can
occur|272120004
from about two days|420797005|258703001
to a month|258706009|259036001
after exposure|71677004|24932003
with deaths apparently|419620001|268923008
peaking|255587001
at about 8 days|258703001
after exposure.|71677004|24932003

Antibiotic-resistant strains|255631004|30714006|48532005|255631004|30714006|276768000
of anthrax|409498004
are
known.|36692007

Early detection|264499004
of sources|260753009
of anthrax infection|409498004
can
allow
preventive measures to|262073000|246445000|262073000|367346004|129428001|246445000|129428001|367346004
be
taken.|419652001

In response
to the anthrax|409498004
attacks|216299002
of October 2001
the United States Postal Service (USPS) installed BioDetection Systems (BDS)|223688001|288563008|224930009|246333005
in their large scale mail cancellation facilities.|255509001|19892000|89925002|255509001|278111002|89925002

BDS response plans|88854002|52713000|88854002|397943006
were
formulated
by the USPS
in conjunction with local responders|255470001
including|55919000
fire,|80032004|257195008
police,
hospitals
and
public health.|310115006

Employees|224528001
of these facilities
have
been
educated|409073007
about anthrax,|409498004
response actions|129264002
and
prophylactic medication.|322837006|410942007|262073000|410942007|410942007

Because of the time delay|103334006
inherent
in getting final verification|42796001
that anthrax|409498004
has
been
used|394850002
,
prophylactic antibiotic treatment|169443000|255631004|276239002|416118004
of possibly exposed personnel|60022001|24932003
must
be
started|385652002
as soon
as possible.|371930009|60022001

Anthrax|409498004
cannot
be
spread|410677005
directly
from person|125676002
to person,|125676002
but
a person's clothing|125676002|272180002
and
body|279495008|123037004
may
be
contaminated|62604006
with anthrax spores.|409498004|263883009

Effective decontamination|255403003|409530006|254648000|409530006
of people|125676002
can
be
accomplished
by a thorough wash-
down
with antimicrobial effective soap|250428009|255403003|25780000|250428009|254648000|25780000
and
water.|11713004|119318008

Waste water|264327008
should
be
treated|28995006
with bleach|76885009
or
other anti-microbial agent.|74964007|250428009

Effective decontamination|255403003|409530006|254648000|409530006
of articles
can
be
accomplished
by boiling contaminated articles|416675009|62604006
in water|11713004|119318008
for 30 minutes|259030007
or
longer.|255511005

Chlorine bleach|29276003|76885009|76885009
is
ineffective
in destroying spores|263883009
and
vegetative cells|4421005
on surfaces,|410678000
though
formaldehyde|111095003
is
effective.|255403003|254648000

Burning clothing|272180002|90673000|272180002|62404004|272180002
is
very effective|260358002|255403003|260358002|254648000
in destroying spores.|263883009

After decontamination,|409530006
there
is
no need to|410525008|103325001
immunize
,
treat|395077000
,
or
isolate contacts|46651001|11723008|46651001|70862002
of persons|125676002
ill|367391008
with anthrax|409498004
unless
they
were
also
exposed|24932003
to the same source|262126009|260753009
of infection.

Early antibiotic treatment|264499004|255631004|276239002|264499004|255631004|416118004
of anthrax|409498004
is
essential?|34325006
delay
significantly lessens chances
for survival.

Treatment|276239002|416118004
for anthrax infection|409498004
and
other bacterial infections
includes|55919000
large doses|255509001|277406006
of intravenous|255560000
and
oral antibiotics,|260548002|255631004
such as fluoroquinolones
(
like ciprofloxacin,|392412000
doxycycline,|372478003
erythromycin,|372694001
vancomycin,|372735009
or
penicillin.|373270004

FDA-approved agents|9571008|260872001

In May 2009,
Human Genome Sciences|50470001
submitted
a Biologic License Application|12893009|410618006
(BLA,
permission to|75554001

(brand name ABthrax
)
intended|361269008
for emergency treatment|182813001
of inhaled anthrax.|14910006|409498004

If death|419620001|268923008
occurs|272120004
from anthrax|409498004
the body|279495008|123037004
should
be
isolated|46651001
to
prevent
possible|371930009|60022001
spread|410677005

anthrax spores.|409498004|263883009

In recent years there|6493001|258707000
have
been
many attempts to|260396001
develop
new drugs|7147002|410942007
against anthrax,|409498004
but
existing drugs|410942007
are
effective|255403003|254648000
if treatment|276239002|416118004
is
started soon enough.|385652002

The name
comes
from _anthrax [??????]_,|409498004
the Greek word|1451003|255373000
for 'coal',|34323004
because of the black skin lesions|315240009|95324001|413464008|95324001|15086000|95324001|371252007|95324001

Robert Koch,
a German physician|7695005|309343006
and
scientist,|308027003
first
identified|7882003
the bacterium|409822003
that
caused|23981006|134198009
the anthrax disease|409498004
in 1875.

His pioneering work|261041009
in the late nineteenth century|260383002
was
one|421379005
of the first demonstrations|255216001|232714002
that diseases|64572001
could
be
caused|23981006|134198009
by microbes.|264395009

In a groundbreaking series|13039001
of experiments,
he
uncovered|255368006
the life cycle|224130005|44180009
and
means|255586005
of transmission|258150004
of anthrax.|409498004

His experiments
not only
helped
create
an understanding|66216009
of anthrax,|409498004
but
also
helped
elucidate
the role
of microbes|264395009
in causing illness|23981006|39104002
at a time|410669006
when
debates
still
took|419652001
place|257557008|421066005
over spontaneous generation|5054005
versus
cell theory.|4421005|362837007

Koch
went
on to
study|110465008|224699009
the mechanisms|257544000
of other diseases|74964007|64572001
and
won
the 1905 Nobel Prize
in Physiology|1360005
or
Medicine|410942007
for his discovery
of the bacterium causing tuberculosis.|113861009|23981006

In May 1881 Louis Pasteur
performed|398166005
a public experiment to
demonstrate
his concept
of vaccination.

He
prepared two groups|420797005|261586004|420797005|160481000
of 25 sheep,|388254009|255392003
one goat|421379005|125097000|421379005|388249000|421379005
and
several cows.|261028005|261028005|34618005

The animals|387961004
of one group|421379005|261586004|421379005|160481000|421379005|389109008
were
injected|422145002
with an anthrax vaccine|396420001
prepared
by Pasteur twice,|421832002
at an interval|385673002
of 15 days|258703001
;
the control group|31509003|261586004|31509003|160481000|31509003|389109008
was
left|7771000
unvaccinated.

Thirty days|258703001
after the first injection,|255216001|28289002|255216001|385218009|255216001|129326001|232714002|28289002|232714002|385218009|232714002|129326001
both
groups|261586004|160481000
were
injected|422145002
with a culture|252398009|61594008
of live anthrax bacteria.|419749002|21927003

All
the animals|387961004
in the non-vaccinated group|261586004|160481000|389109008
died|419620001|419099009
,
while
all
of the animals|387961004
in the vaccinated group|261586004|160481000|389109008
survived.

The human vaccine|278412004|398827000
for anthrax|409498004
became
available|103328004
in 1954.

This
was
a cell-free vaccine|4421005|37837009|398827000|362837007|37837009|398827000
instead of the live-cell Pasteur-style vaccine|419749002|4421005|398827000|419749002|362837007|398827000
used|394850002
for veterinary purposes.|53216000|363675004

An improved cell-free vaccine|385425000|4421005|37837009|398827000|385425000|362837007|37837009|398827000|3442003|4421005|37837009|398827000|3442003|362837007|37837009|398827000
became
available|103328004
in 1970.[35]

The virulent Ames
strain|48532005|276768000
,
which
was
used|394850002
in the 2001 anthrax|409498004
attacks|216299002
in the United States,|223688001
has
received
the most news coverage|4757001
of any anthrax outbreak.|409498004|443684005

The Ames strain|48532005|276768000
contains|42504009
two virulence plasmids,|420797005|373944006
which separately
encode
for a three-protein toxin,|421291004|88878007|80917008
called anthrax toxin,|409498004|80917008
and
a poly-glutamic acid capsule.|116712007|85214009|385049006|116712007|85214009|428641000|116712007|104697004|385049006|116712007|104697004|428641000

Nonetheless,
the Vollum strain,|48532005|276768000
developed
but
never
used|394850002
as a biological weapon
during the Second World War,|81170007|257997001|288495006
is
much more dangerous.|242762006|4757001

The _Vollum_
(also incorrectly
referred|439980006
to
as
_Vellum_
)
strain|48532005|276768000
was
isolated|46651001
in 1935
from a cow|34618005
in Oxfordshire,|223896009
UK.

This
is
the same|262126009
strain|48532005|276768000
that
was
used|394850002
during the Gruinard bioweapons trials.|110465008

A variation|40885006
of Vollum
known|36692007
as "Vollum 1B"|264654002
was
used|394850002
during the 1960s
in the
US
and
UK bioweapon programs.

Vollum 1B|264654002
is
widely
believed
[36] to
have
been
isolated|46651001
from William A.

is
an attenuated strain|24588000|48532005|24588000|276768000

contains|42504009
only
the anthrax toxin virulence plasmid|409498004|80917008|373944006

Rather
some water|11713004|119318008
must
first|255216001|232714002
be
added
to the bleach|76885009
(
e.g.
,
two|420797005

water|11713004|119318008

of bleach|76885009
)
,
then vinegar|227565008
(
e.g.
,
one cup|421379005|415183006|421379005|428178003
)
,
and
then
the rest|258157001
of the water|11713004|119318008
(
e.g.
,
six cups|422218008|415183006|422218008|428178003
).

The pH|27327002|264723009|264724003|264725002|365723003
of the solution|8537005|77899000
should
be
tested|272393004
with a paper test strip|50833004|269814003|408097009|50833004|408097009|50833004|272393004|408097009
;
and
treated surfaces|28995006|410678000
must
remain
in contact|52101004|11723008|52101004|70862002|18720000|11723008|18720000|70862002
with the bleach solution|76885009|8537005|76885009|77899000
for 60 minutes|258701004|255507004|356624006
(repeated applications|27582007|410618006
will
be
necessary to
keep
the surfaces|410678000
wet|17461003
).

Chlorine dioxide|8785008
has
emerged
as the preferred biocide|225773000|255640000
against anthrax-contaminated sites,|409498004|62604006|10546003
having
been
employed|224363007
in the treatment|276239002|416118004
of numerous government buildings|260396001|264308002
over the past decade.|410513005

Its chief drawback
is
the need|410525008|103325001
for _
in situ_ processes to|415178003
have
the reactant
on demand.

To
speed
the process,|415178003
trace amounts|260405006
of a non-toxic catalyst
composed
of iron|3829006
and
tetro-amido macrocyclic ligands
are
combined|89780004
with sodium carbonate|420616006
and
bicarbonate|68615006
and
converted
into a spray.|419694003

The spray formula|419694003
is
applied|410618006
to an infested area|42798000
and
is
followed|367409002
by another spray containing tert-Butyl hydroperoxide.[39]|419694003|42504009|387171003

Using|260676000
the catalyst method,|260686004|272394005
a complete destruction|255594003|64597002
of all anthrax spores|409498004|263883009
can
be
achieved
in
under 30 minutes.|259030007

A standard catalyst-free spray destroys|37837009|419694003
fewer|57176003
than half
the spores|263883009
in the same amount|262126009|107651007
of time.|410669006

They
can
be
heated|88999006
,
exposed|24932003
to the harshest chemicals,|76412005|441900009
and
they
do
not easily|36203004
die._[vague_]|419620001|25615006|399069006|25615006|419099009|25615006

Cleanups
at a Senate office building,|257651001
several contaminated postal facilities|261028005|62604006|288563008
and
other U.S.|74964007|223688001

government
and
private office buildings|257651001
showed
that decontamination|409530006
is
possible,|371930009|60022001
but
it
is
time-consuming|410669006
and
costly.

Clearing|84989007|263707001
the Senate office building|257651001
of anthrax spores|409498004|263883009
cost
$27 million,
according to the Government Accountability Office.|257649000

Cleaning|228402009
the Brentwood postal facility|288563008
outside Washington cost $130 million|421908005

26 months.|258706009

Since then newer|7147002

Carcasses|127853004
may

,
though
it often|70232002
takes|419652001
up to three days|421291004|258703001
to burn|125666000
a large carcass|255509001|127853004
and
this
is
not feasible
in areas|42798000
with little wood.|14402002

Carcasses|127853004
may
also
be
buried
,
though
the burying
of large animals deeply enough to|255509001|387961004
prevent

requires
much manpower|242762006|4757001

Carcasses|127853004
have
been
soaked|42691000
in formaldehyde to|111095003
kill|248007002

enclosing|68947003
an anthrax outbreak|409498004|443684005
has
been
tried
;
this,
while
environmentally destructive,|255303004
causes|134198009
healthy animals to|263775005|387961004
move|302000008|384598002|370125004
away
from an area|42798000
with carcasses|127853004
in search
of fresh graze|261013005|262536007
and
browse.

Some wildlife workers|106541005
have
experimented
with covering fresh anthrax carcasses|255334000|261013005|409498004|127853004
with shadecloth
and
heavy objects.|410712002|260787004

This
prevents|116699007
some scavengers
from opening|56116003
the carcasses,|127853004
thus
allowing
the putrefactive bacteria|51743001|409822003
within the carcass to|127853004
kill|248007002
the vegetative B.

anthracis cells|4421005
and
preventing sporulation.|116699007

This method also|260686004|272394005
has
drawbacks,
as
scavengers
such as hyenas|64704004
are
capable
of infiltrating|47351003
almost any exclosure.

Anthrax spores|409498004|263883009
can
and
have
been
used|394850002
as a biological warfare weapon.

Its first modern incidence|255216001|232714002
occurred|272120004
when
Scandinavian rebels,
supplied|425398004
by the German General Staff used anthrax|7695005|60132005|394850002|409498004
with unknown results|261665006|394617004
against the Imperial Russian Army|297514005|85163001
in Finland|223665002
in 1916.

Anthrax|409498004
was
first|255216001|232714002
tested|272393004
as a biological warfare agent
by Unit 731|258666001
of the Japanese Kwantung Army|414551003
in Manchuria
during the 1930s
;
some
of this testing involved intentional infection|248448006|361269008|272393004|248448006|361269008
of prisoners
of war,
thousands
of whom
died.|419620001|419099009

Anthrax,|409498004
designated
at the time|410669006
as Agent N,|260872001
was
also
investigated|116698004
by the allies
in the 1940s.

There
is
a long history|255511005|255511005|392521001
of practical bioweapons
research
in this area.|42798000

For example,
in 1942,
British bioweapons trials[42] severely contaminated Gruinard Island|110465008|24484000|62604006|288560006
in Scotland|223678002
with anthrax spores|409498004|263883009
of the Vollum-14578 strain,|48532005|276768000
making
it a no-go area|373067005|42798000
until
it
was
decontaminated|409530006
in 1990.

The Gruinard trials|110465008
involved|248448006
testing|272393004
the effectiveness|255403003
of a submunition
of an "N-bomb"?|258310009|54807002
a biological weapon.

Additionally,
five million "cattle|421820001
cakes|226639005
"
impregnated
with anthrax|409498004
were
prepared
and
stored|440276004
at Porton Down|247524003
for "Operation Vegetarian"?|83578000|300928006|83578000|80714005
an anti-livestock weapon|312201009
intended|361269008
for attacks|216299002
on Germany|223637004
by the Royal Air Force.|417696007|417696007|285653008

The infected cattle cakes|226639005
were
to
be
dropped|426684005|404218003
on Germany|223637004
in 1944.

However,
neither
the cakes|226639005
nor
the bomb|54807002
was
used|394850002
;
the cattle cakes|226639005
were
incinerated
in late 1945.|260383002

Weaponized anthrax|409498004
was
part|260726005
of the U.S.|223688001

stockpile
prior to 1972,
when
the United States|223688001
signed|72670004
the Biological Weapons Convention.|255333006

President Nixon
ordered
the dismantling
of US
biowarfare
programs
in 1969
and
the destruction|64597002
of all existing stockpiles
of bioweapons.

In the period 1978?1979|259037005
the Rhodesian government
used|394850002
anthrax|409498004
against cattle
and
humans|278412004
during its war
with black nationalists.|315240009|413464008|15086000|371252007

The Soviet Union
created
and
stored|440276004
100
to 200 tons|258691001
of anthrax spores|409498004|263883009
at Kantubek
on Vozrozhdeniya Island.|288560006

They
were
abandoned|385657008
in 1992
and
destroyed
in 2002.

American military|302314004
and
British Army personnel|40045004
are
routinely
vaccinated
against anthrax|409498004
prior to active service|55561003|224930009
in places|257557008
where biological attacks|12893009|216299002
are
considered
a threat.

Despite signing|72670004
the 1972 agreement to
end|261782000|422117008
bioweapon production
the government
of the Soviet Union
had
an active bioweapons|55561003
program
that
included|55919000
the production
of hundreds
of tons|258691001
of weapons-grade anthrax|312201009|258349007|409498004|312201009|371469007|409498004
after this period.|259037005

On 2 April 1979,|260306008
some
of the over one million people|21481007|421379005|125676002
living|224130005|419749002
in Sverdlovsk
(now called Ekaterinburg,
Russia,|223656009
about 850 miles east|258678002
of Moscow,
were
exposed|24932003
to an accidental release|53348004|58000006|53348004|68776005|53348004|258760001|53348004|129299003|53348004|115956009
of anthrax|409498004
from a biological weapons complex|103360007
located near there.|40415009

At least 94 people|276139006|125676002|263796003|125676002
were
infected
,
of whom
at least 68|276139006|264697007|263796003|264697007
died.|419620001|419099009

One victim|421379005
died|419620001|419099009
four days|421534005|258703001
after the release,|58000006|68776005|258760001|129299003|115956009
ten|23067006|420258001
over an eight-day period|421825006|258703001|259037005|421825006|259032004|259037005
at the peak|255587001
of the deaths,|419620001|268923008
and
the last six weeks later.|422218008|258705008

Extensive cleanup,|41118005
vaccinations
and
medical interventions|74188005|225334002
managed|119270007
to
save about 30
of the victims.

Extensive cover-ups|41118005|255334000
and
destruction|64597002
of records
by the KGB
continued|255238004
from 1979
until Russian President Boris Yeltsin|297514005|85163001
admitted|32485007
this anthrax accident|409498004|409498004|55566008
in 1992.

Jeanne Guillemin
reported|229059009|223458004
in 1999
that
a combined Russian|89780004|297514005|89780004|85163001
and
United States team|223688001
investigated|116698004
the accident|55566008
in 1992.[48][49][50]

Nearly
all
of the night shift workers|276066008
of a ceramics|261253002
plant|31006001
directly
across the street|257710009|398099009
from the biological facility|12893009
(compound 19|62105006
)
became
infected,
and
most
died.|419620001|419099009

Since
most
were
men,|339947000
there
were
suspicions|22927000
by NATO
governments
that
the Soviet Union
had
developed
a sex-specific weapon.|258139002|69658003|312201009|365952006|69658003|312201009|263495000|69658003|312201009|70256003|69658003|312201009|57312000|69658003|312201009

The government
blamed
the outbreak|443684005
on the consumption
of anthrax-tainted meat|409498004|28647000
and
ordered
the confiscation
of all uninspected meat|28647000
that
entered|417985001
the city.|284560003

They also
ordered
that
all stray dogs|448771007
be
shot|28289002
and
that people|125676002
not
have
contact|11723008|70862002
with sick animals.|387961004

There
was
also
a voluntary evacuation|255375007|122461007
and
anthrax vaccination program|49598002
established|263748003|385645004
for people|125676002
from 18?55.[52]|264691008

To
support|9096001|243114000
the cover-up story Soviet|255334000|255532002|255334000|353734004
medical|74188005
and
legal journals|398165009
published
articles
about an outbreak|443684005
in livestock
that caused GI anthrax|23981006|409498004|134198009|409498004
in people|125676002
having
consumed
infected meat,|28647000
and
cutaneous anthrax|84980006
in people|125676002
having
come
into contact|11723008|70862002
with the animals.|387961004

All medical|74188005
and
public health records|310115006
were
confiscated
by the KGB.

In addition|260364009
to the medical problems|74188005|55607006
that
the outbreak|443684005
caused|23981006|134198009
,
it also prompted Western countries to|223369002
be
more suspicious|242762006|22927000
of a covert Soviet Bioweapons
program
and
to
increase|260366006
their surveillance|225419007
of suspected sites.|10546003|415684004|10546003

In 1986,
the
US government
was
allowed
to
investigate|116698004
the incident,
and
concluded
that
the exposure|71677004|24932003
was
from aerosol anthrax|64242006|409498004|52262001|409498004
from a military|302314004
weapons|312201009
facility.

In 1992,
President Yeltsin
admitted|32485007
that
he
was
"absolutely certain"|17162000|255544004
that "rumors"
about the Soviet Union
violating
the 1972 Bioweapons Treaty
were
true.|31874001

The Soviet Union,
like the
US
and
UK,
had
agreed
to
submit
information
to the UN
about their bioweapons
programs
but
omitted
known facilities|36692007
and
never
acknowledged
their weapons|312201009
program.[51]

In theory,

Concentrated anthrax spores|409498004|263883009
were
used|394850002
for bioterrorism
in the 2001 anthrax|409498004
attacks|216299002
in the United States,|223688001
delivered
by mailing postal letters|288563008|126202002
containing|42504009
the spores.|263883009

The letters|126202002
were
sent
to several news media offices|261028005|61695000|257649000
as well as
to two Democratic senators|420797005
:
Tom Daschle
of South Dakota|421672009
and
Patrick Leahy
of Vermont.|421435008

As a result,|394617004
22
were
infected
and
five|421820001
died.|419620001|419099009

Only
a few grams|57176003|258682000
of material|260769002
were
used|394850002
in these attacks|216299002
and
in August 2008
the US Department
of Justice
announced
they
believed
that [Dr.|309343006

responsible.|394851003

These events also|272379006
spawned
many anthrax hoaxes.|409498004

installed biohazard detection systems|409595003|246333005
at its major distribution centers|255603008|255464007|26216008
to actively
scan|373205008
for anthrax|409498004
being
transported|57188001|360300001
through the mail.[56]

In response
to the postal anthrax attacks|288563008|409498004|216299002
and
hoaxes
the US
Postal|288563008
Service|224930009
sterilized
some mail
using|260676000
a process|415178003
of gamma irradiation|421416008|359549004|421416008|108290001
