is
a disorder|64572001
of peroxisomal fatty acid beta oxidation|250753006|31979005
which
results|394617004
in the accumulation
of very-long chain fatty acids|36305009
in tissues|85756007
throughout the body.|279495008|123037004

The most severely affected tissues|4757001|24484000|247591002|85756007|4757001|24484000|248448006|85756007
are
the myelin|79612000|23879005
in the central nervous system,|21483005|278199004
the adrenal cortex|68594002
and
the Leydig cells|44185004
in the testes.|36528006|279572002

Clinically,
ALD|65389002
is
a heterogenous disorder,|64572001
presenting|246105001
with several distinct phenotypes,|261028005|8116006
and
no clear pattern|263707001|272135003
of genotype-phenotype correlation.|8116006|363778006

As an X-linked disorder,|263934009|64572001
ALD|65389002
presents|52101004|246105001
most commonly
in males,|248153007
however approximately 50%|26175008
of heterozygote females|14556007|248152002
show
some symptoms later in life.|260383002|224130005

Approximately one-third|26175008|421379005|70905002
of ALD patients|65389002|116154003
will
present|52101004|246105001
with the childhood cerebral form|68433009|246176004
of the disease,|64572001
which
is
the most severe form.|4757001|24484000|246176004

It
is
characterized
by normal development|17621005|278923009|258744000|278923009
in early childhood,|264499004|68433009
followed|367409002
by rapid degeneration|255358001|33359002
to a vegetative state.|398070004

The other forms|74964007|246176004
of ALD|65389002
vary
in terms
of onset|77374008
and
clinical severity,|58147004|272141005
ranging
from adrenal insufficiency|237785004|386584007
to progressive paraparesis|255314001|1845001
in early adulthood|264499004|41847000
(
this form|246176004
of the disease|64572001
is
typically
known|36692007
as
*
*adrenomyeloneuropathy|65389002
*
*
).

ALD|65389002
is
caused|23981006|134198009
by mutations|55446002
in _ABCD1_,
a peroxisomal membrane transporter protein,|83097008|16267005
located
on the X chromosome.|72837006

The exact mechanism|257544000
of the pathogenesis|303109001
of the various forms|256220008|246176004
of ALD|65389002
is
not
known.|36692007

Biochemically,
individuals|125676002|385435006
with ALD|65389002
show
very high levels|260360000|258395000
of unbranched,
saturated|103401005
,
very long chain fatty acids,|36305009
particularly cerotic acid|102716002
(26
:
0
).

The level|258395000|276625007
of cerotic acid|102716002
in plasma|419185008
does
not
correlate
with clinical presentation.|58147004|246105001

Treatment options|276239002|416118004
for ALD|65389002
are
limited.|255469002

Dietary treatment|41829006|276239002|41829006|416118004
with Lorenzo's oil|328433005
is
controversial,
and
not fully
proven.|277025001

For the childhood cerebral form,|68433009|246176004
stem cell transplant|418318001|263903005|418318001|24486003|419758009|263903005|419758009|24486003
and
gene therapy|394613000
are
options
if
the disease|64572001
is
detected early|260373001|264499004
in the clinical course.|263502005

Adrenal insufficiency|237785004|386584007
in ALD patients|65389002|116154003
can
be
successfully
treated.|28995006

ALD|65389002
is
the most common peroxisomal inborn error|4757001|72906007
of metabolism,|47722004
with an incidence
estimated|414135002
between 1|260305007
:
20,000
and
1
:
50,000.

It
does
not
have
a significantly higher incidence|75540009|371879000
in any specific ethnic groups.|69658003|397731000

ALD|65389002
is
a clinically heterogenous disease.|64572001

The different clinical presentations|263735002|58147004|246105001
are
complicated|255302009
by the pattern|272135003
of X-linked recessive inheritance.|263934009

There
have
been
seven phenotypes|420359007|8116006
described
in male patients|248153007|116154003
with _ABCD1_ mutations|55446002
and
five|421820001
in females.|248152002

Initial symptoms|884001|232714002
in boys|433152004
affected|247591002|248448006
with the childhood cerebral form|68433009|246176004
of ALD|65389002
include|55919000
emotional instability,|18963009
hyperactivity|44548000
and
disruptive behavior|248044002
at school.|257698009

Older patients|70753007|116154003
affected|247591002|248448006
with the cerebral form|246176004
will
present|52101004|246105001
with similar symptoms.

Untreated|25265005
,
cerebral ALD|65389002
is
characterized
by progressive demyelination|255314001|32693004
leading|236874000
to a vegetative state|398070004
and
death.|419620001|268923008

Adult males|133936004|248153007
with an adrenomyeloneuropathy presentation typically|65389002|246105001|246105001
present|52101004|246105001
initially|884001
with muscle stiffness,
paraparesis|1845001
and
sexual dysfunction.|56627002|231532002

All patients|116154003
with clinically recognized ALD phenotypes|65389002|8116006
are
at risk|410519009
for adrenal insufficiency.|237785004|386584007

There
is
no reliable way to
predict
which
form|246176004
of the disease|64572001
an affected individual|247591002|125676002|247591002|385435006|248448006|125676002|248448006|385435006
will
develop
,
with multiple phenotypes|260396001|8116006
being
demonstrated
within families.|35359004

Onset|77374008
of adrenal insufficiency|237785004|386584007
is
often|70232002
the first symptom,|255216001|232714002
appearing
as early|264499004
as two years|420797005|258707000
of age.[3]|424144002

The clinical presentation|58147004|246105001
of ALD|65389002
can
vary
greatly,
making
diagnosis|439401001
difficult.|52925006

With the variety
of phenotypes,|8116006
clinical suspicion|58147004|22927000
of ALD|65389002
can
result|394617004
from a variety
of different presentations.|263735002|246105001

Symptoms
vary
based|418836005
on the disease phenotype,|64572001|8116006|64572001|363778006
and
even
within families|35359004
or
between twins.|11286003

When
ALD|65389002
is
suspected|415684004
based|418836005
on clinical symptoms,|58147004
the initial testing usually|884001|884001|272393004|232714002|232714002|272393004
includes|55919000
plasma very long chain fatty acid (VLCFA) determination|419185008|259493002
using|260676000
gas chromatography-mass spectrometry.|2842000|8959002

The concentration|82742001
of unsaturated VLCFA,|103402003
particularly 26 carbon chains|87453002|46666003
are
significantly
elevated|75540009
in males|248153007
with ALD,|65389002
even
prior to the development|278923009
of other symptoms.|74964007

Confirmation|74996004
of ALD|65389002
after positive plasma VLCFA determination usually|258758003|419185008|10828004|419185008
involves|248448006
molecular genetic analysis|290005005|3950001|272389005|290005005|255395001|272389005
of _ABCD1_.

In females,|248152002
where plasma VLCFA measurement|419185008|272391002
is
not always conclusive
(
some female carriers|248152002|47461006|224526002|47461006
will
have
normal VLCFA|17621005|258744000
in plasma|419185008
)
,
[5] molecular analysis|264706000|290005005|272389005|264605009|290005005|272389005
is
preferred,|225773000
particularly
in cases|398241000|413769002
where the mutation|55446002
in the family|35359004
is
known.|36692007

Although
the clinical phenotype|58147004|8116006|58147004|363778006
is
highly variable|75540009|255372005
among affected males,|247591002|248153007|248448006|248153007
the elevations|255456001
of VLCFA
are
present|52101004|246105001
in all males|248153007
with an _ABCD1_ mutation.[3]|55446002

Because
the characteristic elevations|255456001
associated|47429007
with ALD|65389002
are
present|52101004|246105001
at birth,|3950001
well|20572008
before any symptoms
are
apparent, there
have
been
methods|260686004|272394005
developed
[6][7]
in the interests|225469004
of
including|55919000
it
in newborn screening programs.|60151004

One|421379005
of the difficulties|371157007
with ALD|65389002
as a disease|64572001
included|55919000
in universal newborn screening|73548004|60151004
is
the difficulty|371157007
in predicting
the eventual phenotype|8116006|363778006
that
an individual|125676002|385435006
will
express.

The accepted treatment|385645004|276239002|385645004|416118004
for affected boys|247591002|433152004|248448006|433152004
presenting|246105001
with the cerebral childhood form|68433009|246176004
of the disease|64572001
is
a bone marrow transplant,|23719005
a procedure|71388002
which
carries|288345009
significant risks.|386134007|30207005

However,
because
most affected males|247591002|248153007|248448006|248153007
will
demonstrate
adrenal insufficiency,|237785004|386584007
early discovery|264499004
and
treatment|276239002|416118004
of this symptom
could
potentially
prevent
complications|116223007
and
allow
these patients to|116154003
be
monitored|302805002|13288007
for other treatment|74964007|276239002|74964007|416118004
in the future,
depending
on the progression|246453008|246450006
of their disease.[8]|64572001

The Loes score|278061009
is
a rating
of the severity|272141005
of abnormalities|276654001
in the brain|12738006|258335003
found|404684003
on MRI.|113091000

It
ranges
from 0

ALD|65389002
is
caused|23981006|134198009
by mutations|55446002
in _ABCD1_,
located
at Xq28,
and
demonstrates
X-linked recessive inheritance.|263934009

Males|248153007
with an _ABCD1_ mutation|55446002
are
hemizygous,
as
they only|50607009|420295001
have
a single X chromosome.|125681006|72837006|50607009|72837006

Female carriers|248152002|47461006|224526002|47461006
will
typically
avoid
the most severe manifestations|4757001|24484000|250255003|4757001|24484000|251190009
of the disease,|64572001
but
often|70232002
become symptomatic later in life.|264931009|260383002|224130005

Although
,
the detection
of an _ABCD1_ mutation|55446002
identifies|7882003
an individual|125676002|385435006
who
is
affected|247591002|248448006
with a form|246176004
of ALD,|65389002
however there
is
no genotype - phenotype correlation.|8116006|363778006

Within a family,|35359004
there
will
often|70232002
be
several different phenotypes,|261028005|263735002|8116006
despite
the presence|386397008
of the same causative mutation.|262126009|55446002

In one case,|421379005|398241000
a family|35359004
with six affected members|422218008|247591002|394852005|422218008|248448006|394852005
displayed
five different phenotypes.|421820001|263735002|8116006

There
are
no common mutations|72906007|55446002
that
cause|23981006|134198009
ALD,|65389002
most
are
private
or
familial.|35359004|255401001

Almost 600[3] different mutations|263735002|55446002
have
been
identified|7882003
,
approximately half|26175008
are
missense mutations,|55446002
one quarter|421379005
are
frameshifts,
with
in-frame deletions|257297007
and
splicing defects|85030005|6920004
making
up the remainder.

The incidence
of new mutations|7147002|55446002
in ALD|65389002
(
those occurring spontaneously,|272120004
rather than
being
inherited|255404009
from a carrier parent|47461006|40683002|29679002|40683002
)
is
estimated|414135002
at approximately 4.1%,|26175008
with the possibility
that
these
are
due to germline mosaicism.[3]|8855009

The exact cause|134198009
for the varied collection
of symptoms
found|404684003
in the different ALD phenotypes|263735002|65389002|8116006
is
not
clear.|263707001

The white matter|413773004|185984009|371251000
of the brain,|12738006|258335003
the Leydig cells|44185004
of the testes|36528006|279572002
and
the adrenal cortex|68594002
are
the most severely affected systems.|4757001|24484000|247591002|246333005|4757001|24484000|248448006|246333005

The excess VLCFA|260378005
can
be
detected|260373001
in almost
all tissues|85756007
of the body,|279495008|123037004
despite
the localization|257880008
of symptoms.

Successful treatment|182985004
of the demyelination process|32693004|415178003
that
affects|4065008
the brain|12738006|258335003
with
either
stem cell transplant|418318001|263903005|418318001|24486003|419758009|263903005|419758009|24486003
or
gene therapy|394613000
does
not immediately|49499008
normalize
the VLCFA levels|258395000
in body tissues.|85756007

The levels|258395000
of VLCFA
can
be
normalized
by treatment|276239002|416118004
with Lorenzo's oil,|328433005
but
this
does
not
alter
the progression|246453008|246450006
of the disease.|64572001

It
is
unclear
whether
the accumulation
of VLCFA
is
associated|47429007
with the pathogenesis|303109001
of the disease|64572001
in a specific way,|69658003
or
if
it
is
a biochemical phenotype,|80534008|8116006|80534008|363778006
useful
for identification.[1]|286672002|7882003

Initial attempts|884001|232714002
at dietary therapy|41829006|276239002
in ALD|65389002
involved|248448006
restricting|263856008
the intake
of very-long chain fatty acids (VLCFA).|36305009

Dietary intake|364395008
is
not
the only source|50607009|260753009|420295001|260753009
for VLCFA
in the body,|279495008|123037004
as
they
are
also
synthesized
endogenously.

This dietary restriction
did
not impact|134293005
the levels|258395000
of VLCFA
in plasma|419185008
and
other body tissues.|74964007|85756007

After the realization
that endogenous synthesis|73979006|11798007
was
an important contribution
to VLCFA
in the body,|279495008|123037004
efforts|19487008
at dietary therapy|41829006|276239002
shifted|9546005
to inhibiting|61511001
these synthetic pathways
in the body.|279495008|123037004

The parents|40683002
of Lorenzo Odone,
a boy|433152004
with ALD,|65389002
spearheaded efforts to|19487008
develop
a dietary treatment|41829006|276239002|41829006|416118004
to slow|419443000
the progression|246453008|246450006
of the disease.|64572001

They
developed
a mixture|272163001
of unsaturated fatty acids|21625008
(glycerol trioleate|262222001
and
glyceryl trierucate|414353001
in a 4|260308009
:
1 ratio|260305007|118586006
)
,
known|36692007
as Lorenzo's oil|328433005
that
inhibits|61511001
elongation
of saturated fatty acids
in the body.|279495008|123037004

Supplementation
with Lorenzo's oil|328433005
has
been
found|404684003
to
normalize
the VLCFA concentrations|82742001
in the body,|279495008|123037004
although
its effectiveness|255403003
at treating|28995006
the cerebral manifestations|250255003|251190009
of the disease|64572001
are
still controversial
and
unproven.|277026000

Trials|110465008
with Lorenzo's oil|328433005
have
shown
that
it
does
not
stop|422117008
the neurological degradation|1199008|40091007
in symptomatic patients,|264931009|116154003
nor
does
it
improve|385425000|3442003|385633008
adrenal function.[2]|23451007|246464006

While
dietary therapy|41829006|276239002
has
been
shown
to
be
effective to|255403003|254648000
normalize
the very-long chain fatty acid concentrations|259493002|82742001
in the plasma|419185008
of individuals|125676002|385435006
with ALD,|65389002
allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplants|234336002
are
the only treatment|50607009|276239002|50607009|416118004|420295001|276239002|420295001|416118004
that
can
stop|422117008
the demyelination|32693004
that
is
the hallmark
of the cerebral forms|246176004
of the disease.|64572001

In order to
be
effective,|255403003|254648000
the transplant|263903005|24486003
must
be
done
at an early stage|264499004|21191007|264499004|371508000|264499004|261612004
of the disease|64572001
;
if
the demyelination|32693004
has
progressed|385651009
,
transplant|263903005|24486003
can
worsen|230993007|390772001
the outcome,|394617004
and
increase|260366006
the rate
of decline.

While
transplants|24486003
have
been
shown
to
be
effective|255403003|254648000
at halting
the demyelination process|32693004|415178003
in those presenting|246105001
with the childhood cerebral form|68433009|246176004
of ALD,|65389002
follow-up|308273005
of these patients|116154003
has
shown
that
it
does
not
improve|385425000|3442003|385633008
adrenal function.[12]|23451007|246464006

For patients|116154003
where an appropriate match|33336008
for a transplant|263903005|24486003
cannot
be
found|404684003
,
there
have
been
investigations|386053000
into the use|277889008|419385000
of gene therapy.|394613000

Appropriate vectors|260529001
are
selected
and
modified|243326001
to
express
wild type _ABCD1_,|262290003|261664005
which
is
then
transplanted|263903005|24486003
into the patients|116154003
using|260676000
a similar procedure|71388002
as for a bone marrow|279729006
or
stem cell transplant.|418318001|263903005|418318001|24486003|419758009|263903005|419758009|24486003

Gene therapy|394613000
has
only
been
tried
on a small number|255507004|410680006|255507004|410681005
of patients,|116154003
mainly
in France.|223666001

These patients|116154003
were
only
considered
for gene therapy|394613000
after
there
was
no HLA match|47038001|33336008
for a traditional transplant.|263901007|263903005|263901007|24486003

In two reported cases,|420797005|229059009|398241000|420797005|229059009|413769002|420797005|223458004|398241000|420797005|223458004|413769002
the gene therapy|394613000
was
successful,|385669000
with a resolution
of the demyelination process|32693004|415178003
up to two years|420797005|258707000
after the procedure.|71388002

Although
the gene therapy|394613000
was
successful|385669000
in resolving
the neurological symptoms,|267070008
plasma VLCFA levels|419185008|258395000
remained
elevated.[9]|75540009

Treatment|276239002|416118004
of the adrenal insufficiency|237785004|386584007
that
can
accompany
any
of the common male phenotypes|72906007|248153007|8116006
of ALD|65389002
does
not
resolve
any
of the neurological symptoms.|267070008

Hormone replacement|266717002
is
standard
for ALD patients|65389002|116154003
demonstrating
adrenal insufficiency.|237785004|386584007

Adrenal insufficiency|237785004|386584007
does
not
resolve
with successful transplant,|385669000|263903005|385669000|24486003
most patients still|116154003
require
hormone replacement.[12]|266717002

ALD|65389002
has
not
shown
to
have
an increased incidence|35105006|260366006
in any specific country|69658003|223369002
of ethnic group.|397731000

In the United States,|223688001
the incidence
of affected males|247591002|248153007|248448006|248153007
is
estimated at 1|414135002
:
21,000.

Overall incidence
of hemizygous males|248153007
and
carrier females|47461006|248152002|29679002|248152002
is
estimated at 1|414135002
:
16,800.

The reported incidence|229059009|223458004
in France|223666001
is
