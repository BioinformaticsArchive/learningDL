*Balantidiasis|105638003|56722001

*
is
a protozoan infection|95896000
caused|23981006|134198009
by infection
with _Balantidium coli_.[1]|68532001

Symptoms
can
be
local|255470001
due to involvement|248448006
of the intestinal mucosa,|68534000
or
systemic|31099001
in nature|277302009
and
include|55919000
either
diarrhea|398032003
or
constipation.|14760008

Balantidiasis|105638003|56722001
can
be
treated|28995006
with tetracycline,|372809001|16355005|282831004
[2] carbarsone,|260306008|11370007
metronidazole,|372602008
or
diiodohydroxyquin.|387355005

The
first
study|110465008|224699009
to
generate
Balantidiasis|105638003|56722001
in humans|278412004
was
undertaken
by Cassagrandi
and
Barnagallo
in 1896.

However,
this experiment
was
not successful|385669000
in creating
an infection
and
it
was
unclear
whether _Balantidium coli_|68532001
was
the actual parasite|37763007
used.|394850002

The first case|255216001|398241000|232714002|398241000
of Balantidiasis|105638003|56722001
in the Philippines,|223592003
where
it
is
the most common,|4757001|72906007
was
reported|229059009|223458004
in 1904.

Currently,|15240007
_Balantidium coli_|68532001
is
distributed worldwide
but
less
than 1%|260305007
of the human population|278412004|385436007|278412004|389109008
is
infected.

Pigs|106996007|78678003
are
a major reservoir|255603008|257687008
of the parasite,|37763007
and
infection
of humans|278412004
occurs|272120004
more frequently|242762006|70232002
in areas|42798000
where pigs|106996007|78678003
comingle
with people.|125676002

This
includes|55919000
places|257557008
like the Philippines,|223592003
as
previously
mentioned
,
but
also
includes|55919000
countries|223369002
such as Bolivia|223714003
and
Papua New Guinea.|223626000

But
pigs|106996007|78678003
are
not
the only animal|50607009|387961004|420295001|387961004
where the parasite|37763007
is
found.|404684003

In a Japanese|414551003
study|110465008|224699009
that
analyzed
the fecal samples|39477002|123038009
in 56 mammalian species,|387976007|69658003
_Balantidium coli_|68532001
was
found|404684003
to
be
present|52101004|246105001
not just
in all
the wild boars|78678003
tested|272393004
(
with wild boars|78678003
and
pigs|106996007|78678003
being
considered
the same species|262126009|69658003
)
,
it
was
also
found|404684003
in five species|421820001|69658003
of non human primate|278412004|388073004
:
Chimpanzee|1480007|389223000
(_Pan troglodytes_|1480007
)
,
White-handed gibbon|67567003
(_Hylobates lar_|67567003
)
,
Squirrelmonkey
(_Saimiri sciurea_|52110007
)
,
Sacred baboon|21683004
(_Comopithecus hamadryas_|21683004
)
,
and
Japanese macaque|47878009
(_Macaca fuscata_|47878009
).

In other studies,|74964007|110465008|74964007|224699009
_Balantidium coli_|68532001
was
also
found|404684003
in species|69658003
from the orders Rodentia|388077003
and
Carnivora.[8]|388071002

_Balantidium coli_|68532001
exists
in either
of two developmental stages|420797005|278923009|261612004
:
Trophozoites|103551003
and
Cysts.|441457006

In the trophozoite form,|103551003|246176004
they
can
be
oblong
or
spherical,|34258004
and
are
typically 30
to 150 ?m
in length|410668003
and
25
to 120 ?m
in width.|103355008

It
is
its size|277049003
at this stage|21191007|371508000|261612004
that
allows
_Balantidium coli_ to|68532001
be
characterized
as the largest protozoan parasite|255509001|46770001|263768009|46770001
of humans.|278412004

Trophozoites|103551003
possess
both a macronucleus|6855001
and
a micronucleus,|18072003
and
both
are
usually visible.|24054004

The macronucleus|6855001
is
large|255509001
and
sausage-|227020009
shaped|107644003|300842002
while
the micronucleus|18072003
is
less prominent.|276139006|4657009|263796003|4657009

At this stage,|21191007|371508000|261612004
the organism|410653004
is
not infective
but
it
can
replicate|1305003|27582007
by transverse binary fission.[9]|62824007|243899009

In its cyst stage,|441457006|21191007|441457006|371508000|441457006|261612004|103552005|21191007|103552005|371508000|103552005|261612004
the parasite|37763007
takes|419652001
on a smaller, more spherical shape,|263796003|34258004|255507004|34258004
with a diameter|81827009
of
around 40|259031006
to 60 ?m.

Unlike the trophozoite,|103551003
whose surface|410678000
is
covered only|255334000
with cilia,|69315009|85803001
the cyst form|441457006|246176004|103552005|246176004
has
a tough wall|224727009
made
of one|421379005
or
more layers.|242762006

The cyst|441457006|103552005
form|246176004
also
differs
from the trophozoite form|103551003|246176004
because
it
is
non-motile
and
does
not
undergo
reproduction.|263767004

Instead,
the cyst|441457006|103552005
is
the form|246176004
that
the parasite|37763007
takes|419652001
when
it
causes|134198009
infection.[9]

The diagnosis|439401001
of Balantidiasis|105638003|56722001
can
be
an intricate process,|415178003
partly
because
the related symptoms|272151006|262094002
may
or
may
not
be
present.|52101004|246105001

However,
the diagnosis|439401001
of Balantidiasis|105638003|56722001
can
be
considered
when
a patient|116154003
has
diarrhea|398032003
combined|89780004
with a probable history|2931005|2931005|392521001
of current exposure|15240007|71677004|15240007|24932003
to amebiasis|388759003|387754006
through travel,|420008001
contact|11723008|70862002
with infected persons,|125676002
or
anal intercourse.|2145000

In addition,|260364009
the diagnosis|439401001
of Balantidiasis|105638003|56722001
can
be
made
by microscopic examination|117259009
of stool|39477002
or
tissue samples.[11]|119376003

Preventative measures|246445000|367346004
require
effective personal|255403003|254648000
and
community hygiene.|133928008|284779002

Some specific safeguards|69658003
include|55919000
