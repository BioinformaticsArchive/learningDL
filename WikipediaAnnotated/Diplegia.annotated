*Diplegia|6481005
*
*,
when
used|394850002
singularly,
refers|439980006
to paralysis|44695005
affecting|247591002|248448006
symmetrical parts|18772005|260726005
of the body.|279495008|123037004

This
should
not
be
confused|286933003
with hemiplegia|50582007
which
refers|439980006
to spasticity|397790002
restricted|263856008
to one side|66459002
of the body,|279495008|123037004
or
quadriplegia|11538006
which
requires
the involvement|248448006
of all four limbs|421534005|66019005
but
not necessarily symmetrical.|18772005

Diplegia|6481005
is
the most common cause|4757001|72906007|134198009
of crippling
in children,|410601007|160499008
specifically
in children|410601007|160499008
with Cerebral Palsy.|128188000

Other causes|74964007|134198009
may
be
due to injury
of the spinal cord.|2748008|180959008

There
is
no set course|288524001
of progression|246453008|246450006
for people|125676002
with diplegia.|6481005

Symptoms
may
get
worse|230993007|390772001|231877006
but
the neurological part|1199008|260726005
does
not
change.|243326001|263703002

The primary parts|63161005|260726005|261424001|260726005
of the brain|12738006|258335003
that
are
affected|247591002|248448006
by diplegia|6481005
are
the ventricles,|35764002|21814001
fluid filled sacs|32457005|33463005|255765007
in the brain,|12738006|258335003
and
the wiring|14133008
from the center|26216008
of the brain|12738006|258335003
to the cerebral cortex.|40146001

There
is
also usually
some degeneration|33359002
of the cerebral neurons,|47220008
[2]|260306008
as well as
problems|55607006
in the upper motor neuron system.|91769000|246333005

The term diplegia|6481005
can
refer|439980006
to any bodily area,|42798000
such as the face,|89545001|302549007
arms,|40983000
or
legs.|30021000

In 1890 Sachs
and
Peterson first|255216001|232714002
referenced
to the term Diplegia,|6481005
along
with the word paraplegia,|255373000|60389000
for their Cerebral Palsy classification.|128188000|73504009

In 1955
the word diplegia|255373000|6481005
was
used|394850002
in the clinical field to|58147004|255798002
describe
a patient|116154003
whose limbs|66019005
were
affected|247591002|248448006
in a symmetrical way.|18772005

This included limbs|55919000|66019005
on the same side|262126009|182353008
of the body thus|279495008|123037004
including|55919000
hemiplegia.|50582007

Later|260383002
in 1956 diplegia|6481005
was
presented|246105001
as a form|246176004
of bilateral Cerebral Palsy affecting|51440002|128188000|247591002|51440002|128188000|248448006
like parts|260726005
on
either
side|182353008
of the body.|279495008|123037004

In 1965 Milani Comparetti distinguished diplegia|6481005
from tetraplegia|11538006
by considering
the patient?s upper limb?s ability to|116154003|53120007|371150009|116154003|182245002|371150009
express
a sufficient support reaction.|51117008|9096001|263851003|51117008|243114000|263851003

Thus
diplegia|6481005
usually
refers|439980006
to just symmetry|18772005
of one body part|421379005|38866009
or
limb,|66019005|243996003
as
the legs,|30021000
or
arms.|40983000

While
tetraplegia|11538006
or
quadriplegia refers|11538006|439980006
to paralysis|44695005
of all 4,|260308009
both
arms|40983000
and
legs.[4]|30021000

Facial Diplegia refers|89545001|6481005|439980006
to people|125676002
with paralysis|44695005
of
both
sides|182353008
of their face.|89545001|302549007

Bilateral|51440002
occurs|272120004
when
the onset|77374008
of the second side|81170007|182353008|257997001|182353008|288495006|182353008
occurs|272120004
within one month|421379005|258706009|421379005|259036001
of the onset|77374008
of the first side.|255216001|182353008|232714002|182353008

Facial diplegia|89545001|6481005
occurs|272120004
in 50%
of patients|116154003
with Guillain-Barre Syndrome.|193174005

Facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD)|399091004
is
the second most common adult-onset muscular dystrophy|81170007|72906007|133936004|77374008|73297009|257997001|72906007|133936004|77374008|73297009|288495006|72906007|133936004|77374008|73297009
with facial weakness|95666008
being
a distinct feature
of FSHD|399091004
in over 90%|21481007|264705001|21481007|264703008
of cases.[6]|398241000|413769002

Facial paralysis|280816001
is
usually
caused|23981006|134198009
by traumatic, infectious, neurological, metabolic, toxic, vascular,|263904004|1199008|59820001
and
idiopathic conditions.|54690008|260905004

While
over 50%|21481007
of the cases|398241000|413769002
of unilateral facial paralysis|66459002|280816001
are
caused|23981006|134198009
by idiopathic conditions,|54690008|260905004
less
than 20%
of bilateral cases|51440002|398241000|51440002|413769002
are
idiopathic.|54690008

The most common infectious cause|4757001|72906007|134198009
of facial diplegia|89545001|6481005
is
Lyme disease.[5]|23502006

The treatment|276239002|416118004
for facial diplegia|89545001|6481005
depends
on the underlying cause.|134198009

Some causes|134198009
are
usually treatable
such as infectious, toxic,
and
vascular|59820001
by treating|28995006
the main problem first.|63161005|55607006|255216001|63161005|55607006|232714002

After the underlying problem|55607006
is
cured,
the facial paralysis usually|280816001
will
go
away.

People|125676002
with diplegia|6481005
in their arms|40983000
experience
difficulties|371157007
in reaching,|282679008
pointing
,
grasping,
releasing|129299003
,
manipulating|129408000
objects|260787004
and
many other motor functions|74964007|52479005
performed|398166005
by the hands|85562004
and
arms.[7]|40983000

There
are
several ways|261028005
of getting diplegia|6481005
in the arms.|40983000

It
is
very common|260358002|72906007
for people|125676002
with Cerebral Palsy to|128188000
have
diplegia|6481005
of the arms.|40983000

Although
most people|125676002
with Cerebral Palsy|128188000
have
diplegia|6481005
in their legs,|30021000
some people|125676002
have
diplegia|6481005
in their arms.|40983000

Other ways|74964007
of getting paralysis|44695005
of
both
arms|40983000
is
through a traumatic event|263904004|272379006
or
injury.

There
are
several different modes|261028005|263735002
of treatment|276239002|416118004
for people|125676002
with paralysis|44695005
in their upper limbs.|53120007

For example,
behavioral|844005
and
environmental treatments|276339004|276239002
may
include|55919000
physiotherapy,|91251008
occupational therapy,|84478008
motor learning,|69998004
strength training,|260404005|118629009
and
neurodevelopment treatment.|276239002|416118004

Another treatment|276239002|416118004
may
be
through the use|277889008|419385000
of splints|16650009|48300006
and
casts.|413771002

Electrophysical agents|260872001
may
be
used|394850002
such as neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES).|229239004|18213006|229239004|258096005

Sometimes pharmacological treatments|416608005
are
necessary
such as Botulinum toxin type A.|427412002

On more severe cases surgery|242762006|24484000|398241000|83578000|242762006|24484000|413769002|83578000
of the upper limbs|53120007
may
be
required.[7]

Diplegia|6481005
of the legs|30021000
consists
of paralysis|44695005
of
both
legs.|30021000

There
are
3 levels|277735002
of severity.|272141005

Mild diplegia|255604002|6481005
which means|255586005
the person|125676002
can
usually
walk|129006008
but
might
walk|129006008
a little different,|281411007|263735002|255507004|263735002
can
usually
play|300776002
and
run|418060005|282476009
to a limited extent.|255469002|255590007

Moderate diplegia means|6736007|6481005|255586005
the person|125676002
can
usually
walk|129006008
but
with a slight bend|255510006|89684003|255510006|282977007|255604002|89684003|255604002|282977007
in the knees.|304679005

They usually
can?t
run|418060005|282476009
and
has
to
use|277889008|419385000
the handrails to
go
up and down steps.|255532002|247524003|398298007|353734004|247524003|398298007

People|125676002
with severe diplegia usually|24484000|6481005
need|410525008|103325001
crutches,|363753007
a walker,|49338004
or
a wheelchair to|58938008
be
able to|371150009
get
around.

Children|410601007|160499008
with diplegia|6481005
in the legs|30021000
have
a delayed growth|276617005
in their leg muscles|41123005
which
causes|134198009
the muscles to|91727004
be
short.|359530003|367450005

This then
causes|134198009
the joints to|39352004|81087007
become
stiff
and
the range of motion to|364564000|85680003
decrease|260400001|260370003
as the child grows.|410601007|160499008

?
For the majority
of children|410601007|160499008
with diplegia,|6481005
growth
and
development|278923009
are
not
a problem.|55607006

Children|410601007|160499008
with diplegia|6481005
are
eventually able to|371150009
walk|129006008
,
just normally later|260383002
;
they generally
attend|410542002
regular schools|17854005|257698009
and
become
independently functioning adults.?|246464006|133936004
[8]

The most common cause|4757001|72906007|134198009
of diplegia|6481005
in the legs|30021000
is
Cerebral Palsy.|128188000

Paralysis|44695005
of the legs|30021000
may
also
be
caused|23981006|134198009
by trauma,
injury,
or
genetics
but
this
is
very rare [3]|260358002|84638005|260358002|103356009

Usually
occurs|272120004
within 2 periods|260306008|259037005
:
[3]|260313008

Diplegia|6481005
is
usually
not
diagnosed|439401001
before the age|424144002
of 2 years yet|260306008|258707000
the symptoms
and
signs|72670004
of the earlier stages|264499004|261612004
are
typical
and
should
enable|225791005
the diagnosis to|439401001
be
made
before the contractures|55033002
have
occurred.|272120004

Parents|40683002
suspecting|415684004
diplegia|6481005
should
take|419652001
their child|410601007|160499008
to the doctor|309343006
to potentially
get
an earlier diagnosis.|264499004|439401001|264499004

This
is
broken
up
by age categories.|424144002

Different ages|263735002|424144002
require
different forms|263735002|246176004
of treatment|276239002|416118004
which
may
include|55919000
:
therapy,|276239002
bracing,|360316004|415686002|272363005
walkers,|49338004
wheelchairs,|58938008
and
surgery.|83578000

Currently|15240007
the treatments|276239002
for children|410601007|160499008
are
concentrated
primarily
on independent walking|165245003
but
instead a more independence-oriented therapeutic approach|242762006|371153006|311552005|262202000
would
be
more beneficial.|242762006

This way
the child|410601007|160499008
can
still focus|87017008|363702006
on walking|129006008
but
at the same time|262126009|410669006
be
taught|264939006
to do things
for themselves
while
using|260676000
the best method|260686004|272394005
of walking|129006008
for them.

This
could
include|55919000
using|260676000
a walker|49338004
or
wheelchair to|58938008
get
around
and
do
things easier|36203004
than focusing|251776000
all the attention|6769007
on walking|129006008
so
early.|264499004

For people|125676002
requiring
surgery,|83578000
distal hamstring lengthening|46053002|46147004
is
the most common operation|4757001|72906007|83578000
performed|398166005
because
it
reduces|260400001
knee flexion|304679005|9964006|49076000|9964006|361291001|9964006|72696002|9964006
and
improves|385425000|3442003|385633008
knee motion.[11]|304679005|56219004|49076000|56219004|361291001|56219004|72696002|56219004

?
This first year|255216001|258707000|255216001|259039008|232714002|258707000|232714002|259039008
sees|281004000
the development|278923009
of many milestones,
such as head control,|69536005|31509003|302548004|31509003
reaching|282679008
out
for a toy,|91032009
sitting|33586001
,
starting|255395001|385652002
to
vocalize|415826003
sounds,
and
finger feeding.?|7569003|129007004|302541005|129007004
[8] Most parents|40683002
want|410526009
their children|410601007|160499008
to excel very fast,|260358002|16985007|260358002|277748003
but
there
is
a wide upper|90522003|261183002
and
lower range|261122009
of development time|278923009|410669006
for premature babies|395507008
so
it?s very hard to|260358002|72505002
diagnose|439401001
cerebral palsy|128188000
or
diplegia|6481005
this early.|264499004

The most common symptom|4757001|72906007
of a child|410601007|160499008
with diplegia|6481005
is
stiff lower extremities.|61685007

This
should
become
apparent
by the six month mark|422218008|258706009|46998006|422218008|259036001|46998006
which means|255586005
he
or
she
does
not
have
severe diplegia.|24484000|6481005

During this age|424144002
if
a child|410601007|160499008
is
not
moving
his legs|30021000
on his own then
it
is
recommended to do
some exercise,|61686008
especially
gentle
stretching|122546009
with the child.[8]|410601007|160499008

?
This
is
the age|424144002
at which
the characteristics
of diplegia|6481005
become
more noticeable, mainly because,|242762006
unlike other children|74964007|410601007|74964007|160499008
at this age,|424144002
the child|410601007|160499008
with diplegia|6481005
is
not walking.?|129006008
[8]
By the age|424144002
of three,|421291004
it
is
important
for the child to|410601007|160499008
be
in a specialized school environment|67995009|257698009|276339004|257698009|276339004
so
the child|410601007|160499008
can
participate
in physical therapy|91251008
and
learn|69998004
social skills.

Parents|40683002
should
not
force|285653008
the child|410601007|160499008
to sit,|33586001|282967005
crawl,|282609009
or
walk|129006008
a certain way|17162000
during this age period.|424144002|259037005

Let
the child|410601007|160499008
do
what?s|288495006
comfortable
for them
and
allow
the therapist
to correct
this problem.|55607006

If
you
want|410526009
to
help
your child|410601007|160499008
walk|129006008
more,|242762006
then push toys|420620005|91032009
are
recommended
for walking aids.|224899006

Regular exams|17854005|225886003
should
be
done
to
make
sure the child?s legs|410601007|30021000|160499008|30021000
are
growing
normally
and
he
or
she
is
not
having
any problems|55607006
with the hip.[8]|29836001|85710004

?
This
is
the age range|424144002
at which
the child|410601007|160499008
with diplegia|6481005
makes
the most significant physical improvement|371925005|5880005|371925005|19388002
in motor function.?|52479005
[8]
During this time period|272117007
the child|410601007|160499008
makes
major improvements|255603008
in motor function.|52479005

He
or
she
should
be
in a regular school|17854005|257698009
and
focus|87017008|363702006
on cognitive issues|55607006
not therapy.|276239002

A child|410601007|160499008
using|260676000
a walking aid|224899006
for mobility to|363803005|246197003
move|302000008|384598002|370125004
around
with the other children|74964007|410601007|74964007|160499008
is
not
a bad thing.|556001

If
a child|410601007|160499008
is
not
walking|129006008
yet,
then
this
is
usually
caused|23981006|134198009
by a problem|55607006
in balance,|249982003|78933003|282295000
muscle coordination,|91727004|85352007
spasticity,|397790002
or
leg alignment.|61685007|30021000|182281004|362793004

Each
of these reasons|410666004
should
be
looked|386548000
into closely
so
the problem|55607006
can
be
addressed|397635003
and
fixed.[8]|102491009|261010008

?
By the time|410669006
a child|410601007|160499008
reaches|282679008
this age|424144002
the rate
of physical improvement|5880005|19388002
has
leveled|258395000|276625007
off
in areas|42798000
such as balance|249982003|78933003|282295000
and
coordination,|85352007
and
it?s
a good idea to|20572008|363878000
refocus
the child?s attention away|410601007|6769007|160499008|6769007
from additional physical improvement|260364009|5880005|260364009|19388002
and
toward intellectual learning.?|69998004
[8]
During this time period|272117007
a child|410601007|160499008
should
lean away
from physical therapy|91251008
and
do
more outdoor|242762006
or
social exercises|61686008|229065009
such as sports|415577004
and
adaptive P.E.

Usually
by age 8-10|424144002
a child|410601007|160499008
has
reached maximum walking ability.|282679008|398303009|282097004

This
will
usually
decrease|260400001|260370003
a little|281411007|255507004
when
a child|410601007|160499008
hits|282660005
puberty|18991001
and
gains|35105006|255396000|260366006|260369004|398092000
height
and
weight|27113001|272102008|39857003
because
walking|129006008
becomes
harder|72505002
during this changing period.|243326001|259037005|263703002|259037005

Any significant problems|386134007|55607006
in walking|129006008
should
be
addressed|397635003
with surgery|83578000
at this stage.[8]|21191007|371508000|261612004

?
During this time period|272117007
of a child?s development,|410601007|278923009|160499008|278923009
a major issue|255603008|55607006
is
separating|263869007
from the family.?|35359004
[8] Parents|40683002
should
learn|69998004
how to
cope|405056001
with their child|410601007|160499008
growing
up
and
give|419582001
them more freedom|242762006|37837009
and
independence.|371153006

Teenagers|133937008
need|410525008|103325001
to
make
their own decisions
and
learn|69998004
from them.

One way to do|421379005
this
is
for parents to|40683002
compromise
and
let
the child|410601007|160499008
make
smaller decisions|263796003|255507004
so
they
feel|285854004
important.

Parents|40683002
should
also
understand|66216009
that
their child|410601007|160499008
may
regress
in walking|129006008
some
from increase|260366006
in height
and
weight.|27113001|272102008|39857003

Going
back
to therapy|276239002
during puberty|18991001
is
recommended
so
the teenager|133937008
can
adjust|410617001
to the increase|260366006
in height
and
weight|27113001|272102008|39857003
and
not
regress
as much.[8]|242762006|4757001
