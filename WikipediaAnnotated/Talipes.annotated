*,
or
*
*congenital talipes equinovarus** (**CTEV**),|397932003
[1]|260305007
is
a congenital deformity|276654001
involving|248448006
one foot|421379005|56459004|421379005|259051005|421379005|302545001
or
both.

The affected foot|247591002|56459004|247591002|259051005|247591002|302545001|248448006|56459004|248448006|259051005|248448006|302545001
appears
rotated internally|263861005|260521003
at the ankle.|70258002|108371006|361292008

TEV|397932003
is
classified|73504009
into 2 groups|260306008|261586004|260306008|160481000
:
Postural TEV|35799003|397932003
or
Structural TEV.|397932003

Without treatment,|276239002|416118004
persons|125676002
afflicted
often|70232002
appear
to
walk|129006008
on their ankles,
or
on the sides|182353008
of their feet.|56459004|259051005

It
is
a common birth defect,|72906007|276654001|72906007|276720006
occurring|272120004
in about
one|421379005
in every 1,000 live births.|260305007

Approximately 50%|26175008
of cases|398241000|413769002
of clubfoot|397932003|87465003
are
bilateral.|51440002

In most cases|398241000|413769002
it
is
an isolated dysmelia.|46651001

This
occurs|272120004
in males more often|248153007|70232002
than
in females|248152002
by a ratio|118586006
of 2|260306008
:
1.

A condition|260905004
of the same name|262126009
appears
in animals,|387961004
particularly horses.|35354009

The deformities|276654001
affecting|247591002|248448006
joints|39352004|81087007
of the foot|56459004|259051005|302545001
occur|272120004
at three joints|421291004|39352004|421291004|81087007
of the foot|56459004|259051005|302545001
to varying degrees.|246173007

They

The deformities|276654001
can
be

annother mnemonic
is
the order
in which
the deformity|276654001|127560004|417893002
is

There
are
different causes|263735002|134198009
for clubfoot|397932003|87465003
depending
on what classification|73504009
it
is
given.|419582001

Structural cTEV
is
caused|23981006|134198009
by genetic factors|3950001|255395001
such as Edwards syndrome,|51500006
a genetic defect|276654001|276720006
with three copies|421291004
of chromosome 18.|11698001

Growth
arrests|397829000|6155003
at roughly 9 weeks|258705008
and
compartment syndrome|111245009
of the affected limb|247591002|66019005|247591002|243996003|248448006|66019005|248448006|243996003
are
also
causes|134198009
of Structural cTEV.

Genetic influences|3950001|255395001
increase|260366006
dramatically
with family history.|57177007

It
was
previously
assumed
that postural cTEV|35799003
could
be
caused|23981006|134198009
by external influences|261074009
in the final trimester|42796001|272107002
such as intrauterine compression|398236008|71173004|398236008|263720003
from oligohydramnios|59566000
or
from amniotic band syndrome.

However,
this
is
countered|303502004
by findings|404684003
that cTEV
does
not
occur|272120004
more frequently|242762006|70232002
than usual
when
the intrauterine space|398236008
is
restricted.|263856008

Breech presentation|6096002
is
also
another known cause._[citation|36692007|134198009
needed|410525008|103325001
_] cTEV
occurs|272120004
with some frequency|260864003|272123002
in Ehlers Danlos Syndrome|398114001
and
some other connective tissue disorders,|74964007|105969002
such as Loeys-Dietz Syndrome.|446263001

TEV|397932003
may
be
associated|47429007
with other birth defects|74964007|276654001
such as spina bifida cystica.|58557008

"Equinovarus"|397932003
is
derived
from _equino_,
or
"
like a horse".|35354009|388441000|388445009

A horse's hoof|370652008
is
a large toenail,|255509001|76578001
and
the horse's joint|35354009|39352004|35354009|81087007|35354009|302536002|388441000|39352004|388441000|81087007|388441000|302536002|388445009|39352004|388445009|81087007|388445009|302536002
that
points
backwards|255539006
resembles
a human heel.|278412004|76853006|278412004|362804005

_Varus_ means|261040005|255586005
that
the part distal segment|260726005|46053002|264193005
of a bone|272673000|3138006|90780006|128530007
or
joint slants|39352004|81087007|302536002
towards the body mid-line.[6]|279495008|50009006|123037004|50009006

Screening|20135006
for club foot prenatally|397932003|87465003
is
a debatable topic.|359540000

However,
this
is
commonly
done
as
it
is
easily|36203004
identified|7882003
using|260676000
an ultrasound scan.|359659005

Most fetuses
undergo
a 20 weeks gestation fetal abnormality scan[7]|258705008|276614003|373205008|258705008|276614003
in which club foot|397932003|87465003
is
one|421379005
of the abnormalities|276654001
that
can
be
picked
up.

Some doctors|309343006
have
argued
that club foot|397932003|87465003
may
occasionally
be
associated|47429007
with a syndromic disease|64572001
and
should
therefore
be
screened.|20135006|360156006

If
no syndromic association|263534001|272151006
is
found prenatally,|404684003
most fetuses
with club foot|397932003|87465003
are
born|106970005|81827009|398209006
and
can
live|419749002
a normal life|17621005|224130005|258744000|224130005
with medical treatment.|74188005|276239002|74188005|416118004

Treatment|276239002|416118004
of clubfoot|397932003|87465003
is
evident|18669006
as early|264499004
as Egyptian paintings.|297308004|1919006

In early days,|264499004|258703001
the foot|56459004|259051005|302545001
was
manipulated|129408000
with a Thomas wrench|24470005
and
casting
which
caused|23981006|134198009
fracture|125605004
of several bones|261028005|272673000|261028005|128530007
in the foot.|56459004|259051005|302545001

As medicine|410942007
evolved|59381007
,
club feet|397932003
were
treated|28995006
with a complex surgical release,|103360007|83578000|58000006|103360007|83578000|68776005|103360007|83578000|258760001|103360007|83578000|129299003|103360007|83578000|115956009
which
had
many complications.|116223007

Then
a novel idea|7147002|363878000
of serial casting,
different|263735002
from that
introduced|127487003
in the past|410513005
(
such as the Kite method|66373005|260686004|66373005|272394005
)
was
introduced|127487003
by Ponseti
with dramatic results.|394617004

His results|394617004
were
from recognizing
how
the forefoot|272718006|396956009|117625000|419176008
and
hindfoot|416804009
interact
and
lock
into position|246449006
relative|125677006|29920004
to each other.

This type|261664005
of treatment|276239002|416118004
is
generally used today|394850002
for idiopathic cases|54690008|398241000|54690008|413769002
of clubfoot,|397932003|87465003
while
treatment|276239002|416118004
of neuromuscular causes|134198009
(
such as cerebral palsy|128188000
)
differ.

Clubfoot|397932003|87465003
is
treated|28995006
with manipulation|129408000
by podiatrists,|159034004
physiotherapists,|36682004
orthopedic surgeons,|22731001
specialist Ponseti nurses,|309395003|106292003
or
orthotists|309428008
by serial casting
and
then providing braces to|360316004|415686002|272363005
hold|421139008
the feet|56459004|259051005
in a plantigrade position.|246449006

After serial casting,
bracing|360316004|415686002|272363005
using|260676000
a Dennis-Brown bar|371254008|428003006
with straight last boots,|262185006|16056004
ankle foot orthoses|360318003|70258002|360318003|108371006|360318003|361292008|360318003
and/or
custom foot orthoses (CFO)|360318003
may
be
used.|394850002

In North America,|223503004
manipulation|129408000
is
followed|367409002
by serial casting,
most often|70232002
by the Ponseti Method.|260686004|272394005

Foot manipulations usually|119701006
begin|255395001
within two weeks|420797005|258705008
of birth.|3950001

Even
with successful treatment,|182985004
when
only one side|50607009|66459002|420295001|66459002
is
affected,|247591002|248448006
that foot|56459004|259051005|302545001
may
be
smaller|263796003|255507004
than the other,|74964007
and
often|70232002
that calf,|53840002|244015008
as well.|20572008

Extensive surgery|41118005|83578000
of the soft tissue|181607009
or
bone|272673000|3138006|90780006|128530007
is
not usually necessary to
treat|395077000
clubfoot|397932003|87465003
;
however,
there
are
two minimal surgeries|420797005|255605001|83578000|420797005|255604002|83578000
that
may
be
required
:

Each case|398241000
is
different,|263735002
but
in most cases extensive surgery|398241000|41118005|83578000|413769002|41118005|83578000
is
not
needed|410525008|103325001
to
treat|395077000
clubfoot.|397932003|87465003

Extensive surgery|41118005|83578000
may
lead|88488004
to scar tissue|70582006|275322007
developing
inside the child's foot.|410601007|56459004|410601007|259051005|410601007|302545001|160499008|56459004|160499008|259051005|160499008|302545001

The scarring|275322007
may
result|394617004
in functional, growth|40143009|246464006
and
aesthetic problems|106148006|55607006|271712005|55607006|272144002|55607006
in the foot|56459004|259051005|302545001
because
the scarred tissue|70582006|275322007
will
interfere|78235001
with the normal development|17621005|278923009|258744000|278923009
of the appendage.|66754008|181255000

A child|410601007|160499008
who
has
extensive surgery|41118005|83578000
may
require
on average two additional surgeries|420797005|260364009|83578000
to correct
the issues|55607006
presented|246105001
above.|261183002

In stretching|122546009
and
casting therapy|118643004|276239002|413771002|276239002
the doctor|309343006
changes|243326001|263703002
the
cast|118643004|413771002
multiple times|260396001|410669006|260396001|417929005
over a few weeks,|57176003|258705008
gradually
stretching|122546009
tendons|13024002
until the foot|56459004|259051005|302545001
is
in the correct position|246449006
of external rotation.|257914009

The heel cord|76853006|362804005
is
released|68776005|129299003
(percutaneous tenotomy|103388001|122484000|103388001|78545003
)
and
another
cast|118643004|413771002
is
put
on,
which
is
removed|127485006
after three weeks.|421291004|258705008

To
avoid
relapse|263855007|255318003|58184002
a corrective brace|360316004|415686002
is
worn
for a gradually
reducing|260400001
time|410669006
until
it
is
only
at night|2546009
up to four years|421534005|258707000
of age.|424144002

Treatment|276239002|416118004
for clubfoot|397932003|87465003
should
begin|255395001
almost immediately to|49499008
have
the best chance
for a successful outcome|385669000|394617004
without the need|410525008|103325001
for surgery.|83578000

Over the past 10|410513005
to 15 years,|258707000
more
and
more success|242762006|385669000
has
been
achieved
in correcting clubfeet|370975003|397932003
without the need|410525008|103325001
for surgery.|83578000

The clubfoot treatment method|397932003|276239002|87465003|276239002
that
is
becoming
the standard
in the U.S.|223688001

and
worldwide
is
known|36692007
as the Ponseti Method.|260686004|272394005

Foot manipulations|119701006
differ
subtly
from the Kite casting method|66373005|118643004|260686004|66373005|118643004|272394005|66373005|413771002|260686004|66373005|413771002|272394005
which
prevailed
during the late 20th century.|260383002

Although
described
by Dr.|309343006

Ignacio Ponseti
in the 1950s,
it
did
not
reach|282679008
a wider audience|90522003
until
it
was
re|228877007
-
popularized
around 2000
by Dr.|309343006

John Herzenberg
in the USA|223688001
and
in Europe|223502009
and
Africa|223498002
by NHS surgeon Steve Mannion|445257004|304292004
while
working|261041009
in Africa.|223498002

Parents|40683002
of children|410601007|160499008
with clubfeet|397932003
using|260676000
the Internet also
helped
the Ponseti
gain|35105006|255396000|260366006|260369004|398092000
wider attention.|90522003|6769007

The Ponseti method,|260686004|272394005
if
correctly
done
,
is
successful|385669000

5
casts|413771002
over 4 weeks.|260308009|258705008

Atypical clubfeet|112231000|397932003
and
complex clubfeet|103360007|397932003
may
require
a larger number|255509001|410680006|255509001|410681005|263768009|410680006|263768009|410681005
of
casts.|413771002

Approximately 80%|26175008
of infants|418119000
require
an Achilles tenotomy|61352006|122484000|61352006|78545003
(microscopic incision|84496004|34896006
in the tendon|13024002|256667004
requiring
only local anesthetic|50607009|386761002|50607009|373477003|420295001|386761002|420295001|373477003
and
no stitches
)
performed|398166005
in a clinic|35971002|257585005
toward the end|261782000|422117008
of the serial casting.

Throughout the past decade,|410513005
physicians|309343006
at Texas Scottish Rite Hospital|421662006|421662006|285201006
for Children|410601007|160499008
have
been
studying|110465008|224699009
the effectiveness|255403003
of both
the Ponseti casting method|118643004|260686004|118643004|272394005|413771002|260686004|413771002|272394005
and
the French functional|19434008|40143009|19434008|246464006
(physical therapy|91251008
)
method|260686004|272394005
of stretching,|122546009
massaging|387854002
and
taping|118481004
and
comparing
the results|394617004
with patients|116154003
who
have
undergone surgery.|83578000

Results|394617004
of these studies|110465008|224699009
have
been
presented|246105001
at national
and
international conferences,
such as the Pediatric Orthopaedic Society|394537008
of North America annual meeting,|223503004|53281000|229057006
the International Clubfoot Symposium,|397932003|87465003
Brandon Carrell Visiting Professorship
and
the American Academy
of Orthopaedic Surgeons annual meeting,|22731001|53281000|229057006
and
have
been
published
in the Journal
of Pediatric Orthopaedics.[10]|394537008

After correction
has
been
achieved
,
maintenance
of correction
may
require
the full-time|160903007
(23 hours|264657009|258702006
per day|258703001|259032004
)
use|277889008|419385000
of a splint?also|16650009
known|36692007
as a foot abduction brace (FAB)?|56459004|60074003|360316004|56459004|60074003|415686002|259051005|60074003|360316004|259051005|60074003|415686002|302545001|60074003|360316004|302545001|60074003|415686002
on
both
feet,|56459004|259051005
regardless of
whether
the TEV|397932003
is
on one side|66459002
or
both,
for several weeks|261028005|258705008
after treatment.|276239002|416118004

Part-time use|160904001|277889008|160904001|419385000
of a brace|360316004|415686002
(generally
at night,|2546009
usually 12 hours|259028005|123035007
per day|258703001|259032004
)
is
frequently|70232002
prescribed
for
up to 4 years.|260308009|258707000

Without the parents' participation,|40683002
the clubfoot|397932003|87465003
will
almost certainly
recur|246455001
,
because
the muscles|91727004
around the foot|56459004|259051005|302545001
can
pull|303370007
it
back
into the abnormal position.|408737001

Approximately 20%|26175008
of infants successfully|418119000
treated|28995006
with the Ponseti casting method|118643004|260686004|118643004|272394005|413771002|260686004|413771002|272394005
may
require
a surgical tendon transfer|75152009|13024002|75152009|256667004|129347002|13024002|129347002|256667004|83578000|264983002
after two years|420797005|258707000
of age.|424144002

While
this
requires
a general anesthetic,|50697003|373288007
it
is
a relatively minor surgery
that
corrects|370975003
a persistent muscle imbalance|91727004
while
avoiding disturbance
to the joints|39352004|81087007
of the foot.|56459004|259051005|302545001

The developer
of the Ponseti Method,|260686004|272394005
Dr Ignacio Ponseti,|309343006
was
still treating children|28995006|410601007|28995006|160499008
with clubfeet|397932003
(
including|55919000
complex/atypical clubfeet|103360007|112231000|397932003
and
failed treatment clubfeet|276239002|397932003|416118004|397932003
)
at the University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics well|224871002|224060002|310390009|20572008
into his 90s.

He
was
assisted|371152001
by Dr Jose Morcuende,|309343006
president
of the Ponseti International Association.|263534001|272151006

The long-term outlook[11]|225464009
for children|410601007|160499008
who
experienced
the Ponseti Method treatment|276239002
is
comparable
to that
of non-affected children.|247591002|410601007|247591002|160499008|248448006|410601007|248448006|160499008

Watch
a Video|257194007
on the Ponseti Method|260686004|272394005

Botox|404909007
is
also
being
used|394850002
as an alternative
to surgery.|83578000

Botox|404909007
is
the trade name|27468005
for Botulinum Toxin type A.|427412002

a chemical|441900009
that acts
on the nerves|3057000
that
control|31509003
the muscle.|91727004

It
causes|134198009
some paralysis|44695005
(weakening
)
of the muscle|91727004
by preventing muscle contractions|12140005|116699007|12140005
(tightening
).

As part|260726005
of the treatment|276239002|416118004
for clubfoot,|397932003|87465003
Botox|404909007
is
injected|422145002
into the child?s calf muscle.|410601007|392565009|410601007|245029002|160499008|392565009|160499008|245029002

In about 1 week|258705008|259038000
the Botox|404909007
weakens
the Achilles tendon.|61352006

This
allows
the foot to|56459004|259051005|302545001
be
turned|282987006
into a normal position,|86134005
over a period|259037005
of 4?6 weeks,|260308009|258705008
without surgery.|83578000

The weakness|13791008|260407003
from a Botox injection usually lasts|404909007|28289002|404909007|385218009|404909007|129326001
from 3?6 months.|260281002|258706009

(
Unlike surgery|83578000
it
has
no lasting effect|253861007
).

Most club feet|4757001|397932003
can
be
corrected|370975003
with just one Botox injection.|421379005|404909007|28289002|421379005|404909007|385218009|421379005|404909007|129326001

It
is
possible to do|371930009|60022001
another
if
it
is
needed.|410525008|103325001

There
is
no scar|70582006|275322007
or
lasting damage.|37782003

BC Women|224526002
and
Childrens Hospital|285201006

On occasion,|84638005
stretching|122546009
,
casting|118643004|413771002
and
bracing|360316004|415686002|272363005
are
not
enough
to correct
a baby's clubfoot.|418119000|397932003|418119000|87465003

Surgery|83578000
may
be
needed|410525008|103325001
to
adjust|410617001
the tendons,|13024002
ligaments|52082005
and
joints|39352004|81087007
in the foot/ankle.|56459004|56459004|70258002|56459004|108371006|56459004|361292008|259051005|259051005|70258002|259051005|108371006|259051005|361292008|302545001|302545001|70258002|302545001|108371006|302545001|361292008

Usually
done
at 9
to 12 months|258706009
of age|424144002
;
surgery usually|83578000
corrects|370975003
all clubfoot deformities|397932003|276654001|87465003|276654001
at the same time.|262126009|410669006

After surgery,|83578000
a
cast|118643004|413771002
holds|421139008
the clubfoot still|397932003|87465003
while
it heals.|298005009

It
is
still possible|371930009|60022001
for the muscles|91727004
in the child's foot to|410601007|56459004|410601007|259051005|410601007|302545001|160499008|56459004|160499008|259051005|160499008|302545001
try
to
return|7528007
to the clubfoot position,|397932003|246449006|87465003|246449006
and
special shoes|67995009|43983001
or
braces|360316004|415686002|272363005
will
likely|2931005
be
used|394850002
for
up to a year|258707000|259039008
or
more
after
surgery.|83578000

Surgery|83578000
will
likely|2931005
result|394617004
in a stiffer foot|56459004|259051005|302545001
than nonsurgical treatment,|276239002|416118004
particularly
over time.|410669006

Without any treatment,|276239002|416118004
a child's clubfoot|410601007|397932003|410601007|87465003|160499008|397932003|160499008|87465003
will
result|394617004
in severe functional disability,|24484000|40143009|21134002|24484000|246464006|21134002
however
with treatment,|276239002|416118004
the child|410601007|160499008
should
have
a nearly normal foot.|299477002

He
or
she
can
run|418060005|282476009
and
play|300776002
without pain|22253000
and
wear
normal shoes.|17621005|43983001|258744000|43983001

The corrected clubfoot|370975003|397932003|370975003|87465003
will
still
not
be
perfect,
however
;
a clubfoot usually|397932003|87465003
stays
1
to 1?|260305007
sizes|277049003
smaller|263796003|255507004
and
somewhat less mobile
than a normal foot.|299477002

The calf muscles|392565009
in a leg|61685007|30021000|182281004|362793004
with a clubfoot|397932003|87465003
will
also
stay
smaller.|263796003|255507004

Long-term
studies|110465008|224699009
of adults|133936004
with post-club feet,|288563008|397932003
especially
those
with substantial numbers|410680006|410681005
of surgeries,|83578000
may
not
fare
as well|20572008
in the long term,
according to Dobbs,
et
al.,
[12]
A percentage|118582008
of adults|133936004
may
require
additional surgeries|260364009|83578000
as
they age,|424144002
though
there
is
some dispute|9182005
as to the effectiveness|255403003
of such surgeries,|83578000
in light|56242006|371268001
of the prevalence
of scar tissue present|70582006|52101004|70582006|246105001|275322007|52101004|275322007|246105001
from earlier surgeries.|264499004|83578000

In some cases|398241000|413769002
the leg stops|61685007|260890000|30021000|260890000|182281004|260890000|362793004|260890000
developing
earlier|264499004
than the healthy leg|263775005|61685007|263775005|30021000|263775005|182281004|263775005|362793004
and
a substantial length difference|410668003|263735002
may
occour.

In
come
cases|398241000|413769002
a leg lengthening|61685007|129349004|30021000|129349004|182281004|129349004|362793004|129349004
will
be
necessary,

by use|277889008|419385000
of the Ilizarov method.|260686004|272394005

was
pitcher Jim Mecir,
and
both enjoyed long|112080002|255511005
and
successful careers.|385669000

In fact,
it
was
suggested
in the book _Moneyball_|278212002
that Mecir's club foot|397932003|87465003
contributed
to his success|385669000
on the mound
;
it
caused|23981006|134198009
him to
adopt|160496001
a strange delivery|236973005|118215003
that "
put
an especially violent spin"
on his screwball,
his specialty pitch.|394733009|51104005

The San Francisco Giants|80849007
held|421139008
the record
as the team
with the
all-time highest number|410669006|75540009|410680006|410669006|75540009|410681005|410669006|371879000|410680006|410669006|371879000|410681005
of players
with clubbed feet|397932003
as of July 2010,
and
Freddy Sanchez,
one|421379005
of its infielders,
cites
his ability to|371150009
overcome
the defect|6920004
as a reason|410666004
for his success.|385669000

Tom Dempsey
of the New Orleans Saints,|7147002|262463005
born|106970005|81827009|398209006
with a right club foot|7769000|42974001|239830003|42974001|24028007|397932003|24028007|87465003
and
no toes|29707007
(
this
was
his kicking foot|56459004|259051005|302545001
)
,
kicked
an NFL record 63-yard|258679005|282123007
(58 m) field goal.|255798002|410518001

This kick
became
famous
as the longest NFL field goal|255511005|255798002|410518001
in history.|392521001

Former NFL quarterback Troy Aikman beat|9130008
being
born|106970005|81827009|398209006
with a clubfoot to|397932003|87465003
enjoy|112080002
a productive Hall
of Fame career
with 3 Super Bowl Rings|260313008|40376000|257380004
in Super Bowl XXVII,|40376000
Super Bowl XXVIII,|40376000
and
Super Bowl XXX.|40376000

Despite a club foot,|397932003|87465003
Michael Houser,
goaltender
for the London Knights
of the Ontario Hockey League,|224020003|414251002|224020003|224020003|414446006
won
the Red Tilson Trophy|386713009|87276001|386713009|384759009|371240000|87276001|371240000|384759009
as the most oustanding player|4757001
in the OHL
in 2011-2012.

He
was
signed|72670004
by the National Hockey League's Florida Panthers|414251002|224048003|224048003|414446006|224048003
in July,
2012.[17]

The Nazi Propaganda Minister Joseph Goebbels|11015003
had
a deformity|276654001|127560004|417893002
caused|23981006|134198009
by a botched operation|83578000
for the bacterial infection osteomyelitis,|61011009|301811001|60168000
which
some mistook
for clubfoot.[18]|397932003|87465003

De Witt Clinton Fort,
who
served
in the Confederate Army
as a captain,
was
born|106970005|81827009|398209006
with a clubfoot,|397932003|87465003
and
he
was
known|36692007
during the American Civil War|257874000
as Captain "Clubfoot" Fort,|397932003|87465003
C.S.
A.

Egyptian pharaoh Tutankhamun|297308004|1919006
had
a club foot|397932003|87465003
and
a cleft palate,|253986002
and
it
is
likely|2931005
that
he
needed|410525008|103325001
a cane to|360006004
walk.[19]|129006008

Club feet|397932003
occur|272120004
in other animals,|74964007|387961004
notably equines.|35354009

The condition|260905004
is
characterized
by a strongly upright pastern|370544000
and
a corresponding rotation|70433009
of the coffin bone|370672003|410030004
in the hoof.|18060009|410026002

The condition often|260905004|70232002
affects|4065008
only one foot.|50607009|421379005|56459004|50607009|421379005|259051005|50607009|421379005|302545001|420295001|421379005|56459004|420295001|421379005|259051005|420295001|421379005|302545001

Severity|272141005
varies
,
with some animals|387961004
usable|277889008|419385000
for work|261041009
or
riding,
and
others|74964007
unsound
for life.|224130005

Careful farrier work|308321006|261041009
on the hooves|18060009
can
lessen
the severity|272141005
of many cases,|398241000|413769002
and
in certain circumstances surgery|17162000|83578000
may
be
beneficial.

The visible outward appearance|24054004|255543005|386548000|24054004|255543005|255412001
of a club foot|397932003|87465003
has
different possible origins|263735002|371930009|255395001|263735002|60022001|255395001
that
include|55919000
a genetic predisposition|47708004
to the condition,|260905004
a congenital defect|276654001
formed|35810008
while
the animal|387961004
is
in the womb,|35039007|181452004
or
problems|55607006
with diet|41829006
and
bone development
during the early post-natal period.|264499004|288563008|223731005|259037005

Certain horse breeds|17162000|35354009|17162000|388441000|17162000|388445009
appear
to
be
more
predisposed
to the condition|260905004
than others,|74964007
but
research
has
yet to
identify|7882003
the genes|67271001
involved.|248448006

A grading scale|258349007|19892000|258349007|278111002|371469007|19892000|371469007|278111002
exists
to
assess
the severity|272141005
of club feet,|397932003
which
are
caused|23981006|134198009
by a deep digital flexor contraction syndrome.|131197000

When
the muscle fibers|91727004|400293002|91727004|37202001
of the upper leg's deep digital flexor muscle|261183002|41123005|131197000|261006005|261183002|41123005|131197000|82680008
contract|78558002
excessively,|260378005
this
affects|4065008
the tendon|13024002|256667004
of the same name|262126009
that
comes
off of this muscle group|91727004|261586004|91727004|160481000|91727004|389109008
and
attaches|102491009
at the bottom|421610009
of the coffin bone.|370672003|410030004

A constant upward pull|353734004|303370007
by the tendon|13024002|256667004
on the coffin bone|370672003|410030004
and
other structure|74964007
of the horse's hoof|370652008
creates
the condition.|260905004

While
many young foals|84422007
are
born|106970005|81827009|398209006
with somewhat upright pasterns,|370544000
the condition|260905004
may
resolve
naturally
or
with minimal intervention|255605001|225334002|255604002|225334002
if
begun|255395001
early.|264499004

However,
some cases|398241000|413769002
are
so severe|223528007|24484000
that more drastic treatment|242762006|276239002|242762006|416118004
may
be
required.[20]
