*Angiomyxoma|404082003
*
*
is
a myxomatous tumor|108369006
involving|248448006
the blood vessels.|59820001

It
can
affect|4065008
the vulva[1]|45292006|265796001
and
other parts|74964007|260726005
of the pelvis.[2]|277113001|21844003|229765004

Aggressive angiomyxoma|404085001
was
originally
described
in 1983,
[3]|260313008
but
the term "angiomyxoma"|404082003
dates|410671006
back to
at least 1952.[4]|276139006|263796003

Although
it
is
a benign tumour|20376005
and
does
not 'invade'
the neighbouring tissue,|40415009|85756007
it
has
a tendency to
recur|246455001
after surgical excision|128303001
so
it
is
termed
as aggressive.|61372001

The recurrence|246455001
can
be
as
close|29179001
as six months|422218008|258706009
from initial resection.|884001|118292001|884001|128303001|232714002|118292001|232714002|128303001

It
will
not
be
surprising
to
find
cases|398241000|413769002
coming
to tertiary medical centers|84965000|288565001
with history|392521001
of
having
a labial mass|261114002|300848003|261114002|118538004
(sometimes
misdiagnosed
as gartner's cyst|82520000
and
have
multiple surgical excisions|260396001|128303001
from various doctors.|256220008|309343006

There
is
no proven medical therapy|277025001|243121000
and
people|125676002
have
tried various sorts|256220008
of chemotherapy|416608005|367336001
like Tamoxifen,|373345002
Leuprolide|350364005
and
even full blown chemotherapy.|261015003|387085005|416608005|261015003|387085005|367336001|261015003|416608005|261015003|367336001
