*Choking|249489001

is
the mechanical obstruction|261018001|26036001
of the flow
of air|417696007
from the environment|276339004
into the lungs.|39607008

Choking|249489001
prevents|116699007
breathing,|14910006|258162000
and
can
be
partial|255609007
or
complete,|255594003
with partial choking|255609007|249489001
allowing
some,
although
inadequate, flow|71978007
of air|417696007
into the lungs.|39607008

Prolonged|255224006
or
complete choking results|255594003|249489001|394617004
in asphyxia|66466001
which
leads|88488004|236874000
to anoxia|29658002
and
is
potentially fatal.|399166001

Oxygen|24099007
stored|440276004
in the blood|87612001|119273009
and
lungs|39607008
keep
the victim
alive|438949009
for several minutes|261028005|258701004|261028005|255507004|261028005|356624006
after breathing|14910006|258162000
is
stopped completely.[1]|385654001

Choking|249489001
can
be
caused|23981006|134198009
by
:

The type|261664005
of choking most commonly|249489001
recognized
as such
by the public
is
the lodging|414418009
of foreign objects|260787004
(also
known|36692007
as foreign bodies,|125670008
but
consisting
of any object|260787004
which
comes
from
outside the body|279495008|123037004
itself,
including|55919000
food,|255620007
toys|91032009
or
household objects|260787004
)
in the airway.[2]|43725001|89187006

This type|261664005
of choking|249489001
is
often|70232002
suffered
by small children,|255507004|410601007|255507004|160499008
who
are
unable to|371151008
appreciate
the hazard
inherent
in putting small objects|255507004|260787004
in their mouth.|74262004|123851003|21082005|181220002

In adults,|133936004
it mostly
occurs|272120004
whilst
the patient|116154003
is
eating.|48263008

In one study,|421379005|110465008|421379005|224699009
peanuts|256349002
were
the most common obstruction.[4]|4757001|72906007|26036001

Choking|249489001
can
be
treated|28995006
with a number|410680006|410681005
of different procedures,|263735002|71388002
with
both
basic techniques|272394005|418836005|272394005
available|103328004
for first aiders|255216001|232714002
and
more advanced techniques|242762006|86005002|272394005
available|103328004
for health professionals.|223366009

In the United States,|223688001
members|394852005
of the public commonly
assume
that abdominal thrusts,|277112006
also
known|36692007
as the
*
*Heimlich Maneuver|23690002
*
*,
are
the correct procedure|71388002
for choking,|249489001
due to widespread promotion|85333001
of this technique|272394005
in the past,|410513005
including|55919000
recommendations
from the American Heart Association|80891009|263534001|80891009|272151006|302509004|263534001|302509004|272151006
and
the American Red Cross.|386713009|65145006|371240000|65145006

People elsewhere also often|125676002|70232002
assume
this,
due|42752001
in part|260726005
to widespread use|85333001|277889008|85333001|419385000
of this technique|272394005
in movies._[citation
needed|410525008|103325001

Most modern protocols,|4757001|258049002
including|55919000
those
of the American Heart Association|80891009|263534001|80891009|272151006|302509004|263534001|302509004|272151006
and
the American Red Cross,|386713009|65145006|371240000|65145006
recommend
several stages,|261028005|261612004
designed
to
apply|410618006|417924000
increasingly more
pressure.|279046003|13543005|257893003

The Red Cross|386713009|65145006|371240000|65145006
changed|243326001|263703002
their recommendation
in 2006,
ending|261782000|422117008
their promotion
of abdominal thrusts|277112006
as the primary treatment|63161005|276239002|63161005|416118004|261424001|276239002|261424001|416118004
for choking.[5]|249489001

The key stages|261612004
in most modern protocols|258049002
include|55919000
:

This stage|21191007|371508000|261612004
was
introduced|127487003
in many protocols|258049002
as
it
was
found|404684003
that
many people|125676002
were
too quick to|255358001
undertake
potentially dangerous interventions,|225334002
such as abdominal thrusts,|277112006
for items
which
could
have
been
dislodged
without intervention.|225334002

Also,
if
the choking|249489001
is
caused|23981006|134198009
by an irritating substance|105590001
rather than
an obstructing one,|263821009|421379005
and
if conscious,
the patient|116154003
should
be
allowed
to
drink|226465004
water|11713004|119318008
on their own to
try
to
clear|263707001
the throat.|54066008|49928004|264231000

Since
the airway|43725001|89187006
is
already
closed|29179001
,
there
is
very little danger|260358002|281411007|260358002|255507004
of water|11713004|119318008
entering|417985001
the lungs.|39607008

Coughing|272039006
is
normal|17621005|258744000
after most
of the irritant|412453003|263789000
has
cleared|84989007
,
and
at this
point
the patient|116154003
will
probably
refuse|58377000
any additional water|260364009|11713004|260364009|119318008
for a short time.|359530003|410669006|367450005|410669006

The majority
of protocols now|258049002
advocate
the use|277889008|419385000
of hard blows|72505002
with the heel|76853006|362804005
of the hand|85562004|302539009
on the upper back|35549004
of the victim.

The number to|410680006|410681005
be
used|394850002
varies
by training organization,|118629009|21139007
but
is
usually
between five|421820001
and
twenty.

The back slap|123961009|255551008|281213008|302552004|77568009
is
designed to
use|277889008|419385000
percussion to|75180006
create
pressure|279046003|13543005|257893003
behind the blockage,
assisting|119265000
the patient|116154003
in dislodging
the article.

In some cases|398241000|413769002
the physical vibration|5880005|271421005|5880005|33679000|19388002|271421005|19388002|33679000
of the action|129264002
may
also
be
enough to
cause|23981006|134198009
movement|255324009
of the article sufficient to|51117008
allow
clearance|260695007
of the airway.|43725001|89187006

Almost all protocols|258049002
give|419582001
back slaps
as a technique to|272394005
be
used|394850002
before potentially damaging interventions|236874000|225334002|421718005|225334002
such as abdominal thrusts.|277112006

Henry Heimlich,|304612009
noted
for promulgating abdominal thrusts,|277112006
claimed
that
back slaps
were
proven|277025001
to
cause|23981006|134198009
death|419620001|268923008
by lodging foreign objects|414418009|260787004
into the windpipe.|44567001

The 1982 Yale study|110465008|224699009
by Day,|258703001|259032004
DuBois,
and
Crelin
that "
persuaded
the American Heart Association to|80891009|263534001|80891009|272151006|302509004|263534001|302509004|272151006
stop|422117008
recommending
back blows
for dealing
with choking...|249489001
was
partially
funded
by Heimlich's own foundation."[9]|418836005
According to Roger White MD|413773004|185984009|371251000
of the Mayo Clinic|223807006|35971002|223807006|257585005
and
American Heart Association (AHA),|80891009|263534001|80891009|272151006|302509004|263534001|302509004|272151006
"There
was
never
any science here.

Heimlich overpowered science
all
along the way
with his slick tactics
and
intimidation,|279497000
and
everyone,
including|55919000
us
at the AHA,|387426003
caved|285067000
in."[10]

*Abdominal thrusts|277112006

*,
also
known|36692007
by the proprietary
name|27468005
the
*
*Heimlich Maneuver|23690002
*
*
(
after Henry Heimlich,|304612009
who
first
described
the procedure|71388002
in a June 1974 informal article entitled "Pop Goes
the Cafe|257576005
Coronary",|80891009
published
in the journal _Emergency Medicine_|433497004|25876001|410942007
).

Edward A.

Patrick,
MD,
PhD,
an
associate|47429007
of Heimlich,
has
claimed
to
be
the uncredited co-developer
of the procedure.|71388002

Heimlich
has
objected|260787004
to the name "abdominal thrusts"|277112006
on the grounds
that
the vagueness|25615006
of the term "abdomen"|277112006|52731004|302553009
could
cause|23981006|134198009
the rescuer to
exert|19487008
force|285653008
at the wrong site.[12]|10546003

Performing|398166005
abdominal thrusts|277112006
involves|248448006
a rescuer standing|10904000
behind a patient|116154003
and
using|260676000
their hands to|85562004
exert|19487008
pressure|279046003|13543005|257893003
on the bottom|421610009
of the diaphragm.|263734003|336704008|181614006

This
compresses|37204000
the lungs|39607008
and
exerts|19487008
pressure|279046003|13543005|257893003
on any object|260787004
lodged|414418009
in the trachea,|44567001|181213009
hopefully expelling
it.

This amounts|107651007
to an artificial cough.|71967004|272039006

Due to the forceful nature|277302009|285653008|277302009
of the procedure,|71388002
even
when
done
correctly
it
can
injure
the person|125676002
on whom
it
is
performed.|398166005

Bruising|125667009
to the abdomen|277112006|52731004|302553009
is
highly likely|75540009|2931005
and
more serious injuries|242762006|42745003
can
occur|272120004
,
including|55919000
fracture|125605004
of the xiphoid process|20298003|272711000
or
ribs.[13]|113197003

In some areas,|42798000
such as Australia,|223621005
authorities
believe
that there
is
not enough scientific evidence to|18669006
support|9096001|243114000
the use|277889008|419385000
of abdominal thrusts|277112006
and
their use|277889008|419385000
is
not
recommended
in first aid.[14]|386308007

A person|125676002
may
also
perform|398166005
abdominal thrusts|277112006
on themselves
by
using|260676000
a fixed object|102491009|260787004|261010008|260787004
such as a railing
or
the
back of a chair to
apply|410618006|417924000
pressure|279046003|13543005|257893003
where a rescuer's hands|85562004
would
normally
do
so.|223528007

As
with other forms|74964007|246176004
of the procedure,|71388002
it
is
possible|371930009|60022001
that internal injuries|105612003|79322002
may
result.|394617004

A modified version|22303008|243326001|22303008
of the technique|272394005
is
sometimes
taught|264939006
for use|277889008|419385000
with pregnant|77386006|127362006
and/or
obese patients.|414915002|116154003

The rescuer
places|257557008
their hand|85562004|302539009
in the center|26216008
of the chest|261179002
to compress,|37204000
rather than
in the abdomen.|277112006|52731004|302553009

The American Medical Association|74188005|263534001|74188005|272151006
advocates
sweeping
the fingers|7569003|259052003
across the back of the throat to|255551008|54066008|255551008|49928004|255551008|264231000
attempt
to
dislodge
airway obstructions,|79688008
once
the choking victim|249489001
becomes
unconscious.[15]|418107008

Some protocols|258049002
advocate
the use|277889008|419385000
of the rescuer's finger|7569003|302541005
to 'sweep' foreign objects away|260787004
once
they
have
reached|282679008
the mouth._[citation|74262004|123851003|21082005|181220002
needed|410525008|103325001
_] However,
many modern protocols|258049002
recommend
against the use|277889008|419385000
of the finger sweep since,|7569003|302541005
if
the patient|116154003
is
conscious,
they
will
be
able to|371150009
remove|127485006
the foreign object|260787004
themselves,
or
if
they
are
unconscious,|418107008
the rescuer
should
simply
place|257557008|421066005
them
in the recovery position|34026001
(
where the object|260787004
should
fall out|271594007
due to gravity|91071007
).

There
is
also
a risk|30207005
of causing further damage|23981006|46053002|37782003
(
for instance
inducing|16404004
vomiting|249497008
)
by
using|260676000
a finger sweep technique.|7569003|272394005|302541005|272394005

The advanced medical procedure to|86005002|50731006
remove|127485006
such objects|260787004
is
inspection|32750006
of the airway|43725001|89187006
with a laryngoscope|44738004
or
bronchoscope,|24174009
and
removal|118292001|128303001
of the object|260787004
under direct vision,|255589003|281004000
followed|367409002
by CPR|89666000
if
the patient|116154003
does
not
start|255395001
breathing|14910006|258162000
on their own.

Severe cases|24484000|398241000|24484000|413769002
where there
is
an inability to
remove|127485006
the object|260787004
may
require
cricothyrotomy.

In most protocols,|258049002
once
the patient|116154003
has
become
unconscious,|418107008
the emphasis switches
to performing CPR,|89666000
involving|248448006
both
chest compressions|261179002|71173004
and
artificial respiration.|40617009

These actions|129264002
are
often enough to|70232002
dislodge
the item sufficiently
for air to|417696007
pass
it,
allowing
gaseous exchange|308698004|74947009
in the lungs.|39607008

Dr.|309343006

Heimlich also
advocates
the use|277889008|419385000
of the technique|272394005
as a treatment|276239002|416118004
for drowning[21]|40947009
and
asthma[22] attacks,|266364000
but
Heimlich's promotion to
use|277889008|419385000
