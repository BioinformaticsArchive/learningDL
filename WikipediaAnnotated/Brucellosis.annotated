[1][2]|303183002
is
a highly contagious zoonosis|75540009|28762008
caused|23981006|134198009
by ingestion|111984006
of unsterilized milk|3718001|119321005|70813002
or
meat|28647000
from infected animals|387961004
or
close contact|29179001|11723008|29179001|70862002
with their secretions.|46242002

Transmission|258150004
from human|278412004
to human,|278412004
through sexual contact|365952006|11723008|365952006|70862002
or
from mother|72705000
to child,|410601007|160499008
is
rare|84638005|103356009
but
possible.[3]|371930009|60022001

_Brucella_ spp.|26250004

are
small, Gram-negative, non-motile, non-spore-forming, rod shaped|427824002|255811001|35810008|107644003|427824002|255811001|35810008|300842002|427824002|263883009|35810008|107644003|427824002|263883009|35810008|300842002
(coccobacilli bacteria.|103423009|409822003

They
function|246464006
as facultative intracellular parasites|284672000|83167003
causing|23981006
chronic disease,|27624003
which usually
persists
for life.|224130005

Symptoms
include|55919000
profuse sweating|52613005
and

Brucellosis|75702008
has
been
recognized
in animals|387961004
including|55919000
humans|278412004
since
the 20th century.

Under the name _
*
*Malta fever|75702008
*
*_,
the disease now called brucellosis|64572001|75702008
first
came
to the attention|6769007
of British medical officers|224533002
in the 1850s
in Malta|223670009
during the Crimean War.

The causal relationship|134198009|272151006
between organism|410653004
and
disease|64572001
was
first|255216001|232714002
established|263748003|385645004
in 1887
by Dr.|309343006

David Bruce.[4][5]

In 1897,
Danish veterinarian Bernhard Bang|106290006
isolated|46651001
_Brucella abortus_|24224000|427795000
as the agent|260872001
;
and
the additional name|260364009
*
*Bang's disease|427795000
*
*
was
assigned.

Maltese doctor|309343006
and
archaeologist Sir Themistocles Zammit|158929005
earned
a knighthood
for identifying unpasteurized milk|7882003|3718001|7882003|119321005|7882003|70813002
as the major source|255603008|260753009
of the pathogen|264418008
in 1905,
and
it
has
since
become
known|36692007
as Malta Fever.|75702008

In cattle,
this disease|64572001
is
also
known|36692007
as
*
*contagious abortion|427795000
*
*
and
*
*infectious abortion|70317007|386639001
*
*.

The popular name
*
*undulant fever|75702008
*
* originates
from the characteristic undulance
(
or
"wave-like" nature|277302009
)
of the fever,|386661006
which
rises
and
falls|1912002
over weeks|258705008
in untreated patients.|25265005|116154003

In the 20th century,
this name,
along
with _brucellosis_|75702008
(
after
_Brucella_,|26250004
named|27468005
for Dr.|309343006

Bruce
)
,
gradually
replaced|282089006|370124000
the 19th century names
*
*Mediterranean fever|75702008
*
*
and
_Malta fever_.|75702008

In 1989,
neurologists|56397003
in Saudi Arabia|223616007
discovered
*
*neurobrucellosis
*
*,
a neurological involvement|1199008|248448006
in brucellosis.[6][7]|75702008

The following obsolete names|255260001|41228009
have
previously
been
applied|410618006
to brucellosis|75702008
:

Species|69658003

and
elk|48289008
in North America|223503004
and
_B.

suis_
is
endemic
in caribou.|71087001

_Brucella_ species|26250004|116505000
have
also
been
isolated|46651001
from several marine mammal species|261028005|387976007|69658003
(pinnipeds
and
cetaceans
).

The bacterium _Brucella abortus_|24224000|26250004|409822003|24224000|409822003|427795000
is
the principal cause|63161005|134198009|302311007|134198009
of brucellosis|75702008
in cattle.

The bacteria|409822003
are
shed
from an infected animal|387961004
at
or
around the time|410669006
of calving
or
abortion.|70317007|386639001

Once
exposed|24932003
,
the likelihood|2931005
of an animal|387961004
becoming
infected
is
variable,|255372005
depending
on age,|424144002
pregnancy status,|289908002|263490005
and
other intrinsic factors|74964007|41410009
of the animal,|387961004
as well as
the amount|107651007
of bacteria|409822003
to which
the animal|387961004
was
exposed.|24932003

The most common clinical signs|4757001|72906007|58147004|72670004
of cattle
infected
with _Brucella abortus_|24224000|427795000
are
high incidences|75540009|371879000
of abortions,|70317007|386639001
arthritic joints|39352004|81087007
and
retained|397909002
after-birth.|237679004|3950001|288563008|3950001

There
are
two main causes|420797005|63161005|134198009
for spontaneous abortion|17369002
in animals.|387961004

The first|255216001|232714002
is
due to erythritol,
which
can
promote
infections
in the fetus|83418008
and
placenta.|62669004|181455002

The second|81170007|257997001|288495006
is
due to the lack|41277001
of anti-Brucella activity|26250004|48761009|26250004|55561003|26250004|258745004|26250004|257733005
in the amniotic fluid.|77012006

Males|248153007
can
also
harbor|257621007
the bacteria|409822003
in their reproductive tracts,
namely seminal vesicles,|64739004
ampullae,
testicles,|279572002
and
epididymes.

The causative agent|362944004
of brucellosis|75702008
in dogs|448771007
is
_Brucella canis_.|38025008|428174001

It
is
transmitted|60117003|258150004
to other dogs|74964007|448771007|74964007
through breeding
and
contact|11723008|70862002
with aborted fetuses.|28677006

Brucellosis|75702008
can
occur|272120004
in humans|278412004
that
come
in contact|52101004|11723008|52101004|70862002|18720000|11723008|18720000|70862002
with infected aborted tissue|85756007
or
semen.|264337003|6993007

The bacteria|409822003
in dogs normally|448771007
infect
the genitals
and
lymphatic system,|89890002
but
can
also
spread|410677005
to the eye,|81745001|244486005
kidney,|64033007|17373004|181414000
and
intervertebral disc|360499006|244570000
(causing discospondylitis.|23981006

Symptoms
of brucellosis|75702008
in dogs|448771007
include|55919000
abortion|70317007|386639001
in female dogs|248152002|448771007|248152002|224526002|448771007|224526002
and
scrotal inflammation|236781003
and
orchitis|274718005
(inflammation|257552002
of the testicles|279572002
)
in males.|248153007

Fever|386661006
is
uncommon.|103356009

Infection
of the eye|81745001|244486005
can
cause|23981006|134198009
uveitis,|128473001
and
infection
of the intervertebral disc|360499006|244570000
can
cause|23981006|134198009
pain|22253000
or
weakness.|13791008|260407003

Blood testing|252275004
of the dogs|448771007
prior to breeding
can
prevent
the
spread|410677005
of this disease.|64572001

It
is
treated|28995006
with antibiotics,|255631004
as
with humans,|278412004
but
it
is
difficult to|52925006
cure.[9]

Brucellosis|75702008
in humans|278412004
is
usually
associated|47429007
with the consumption
of unpasteurized milk|3718001|119321005|70813002
and
soft cheeses|226848002
made
from the milk|3718001|119321005|70813002
of infected animals,|387961004
primarily goats,|125097000|388249000
infected
with _Brucella melitensis_|72829003|427999003
and
with occupational exposure|87923000|71677004|87923000|24932003
of laboratory workers,|261904005|106541005
veterinarians,|106290006
and
slaughterhouse workers.|106541005

Some vaccines|398827000
used|394850002
in livestock,
most notably _B.

abortus_ strain 19,|28677006|48532005|28677006|276768000|299025000|48532005|299025000|276768000
also
cause|23981006|134198009
disease|64572001
in humans|278412004
if
accidentally
injected.|422145002

Brucellosis|75702008
induces|16404004
inconstant fevers,|386661006
sweating|161857006
,
weakness,|13791008|260407003
anaemia,|271737000
headaches,|25064002
depression,|35489007|366979004|255339005
and
muscular|91727004|263816006
and
bodily pain.|22253000

The symptoms
are
like those
associated|47429007
with many other febrile diseases,|74964007|386661006|64572001
but
with emphasis
on muscular pain|68962001
and
sweating.|161857006

The duration|103335007
of the disease|64572001
can
vary
from a few weeks|57176003|258705008
to many months|258706009
or
even years.|258707000

In the first stage|258215001
of the disease,|64572001
septicaemia|105592009
occurs|272120004
and
leads|88488004|236874000
to the classic triad|255301002|255333006
of undulant fevers,|75702008
sweating|161857006
(often|70232002
with characteristic smell,|397686008
likened
to
wet|17461003
hay
)
,
and
migratory arthralgia|255309000|57676002
and
myalgia.|68962001

Blood tests characteristically|252275004
reveal|263857004
leukopenia|419188005
and
anemia,|271737000
show
some elevation|103720008|255456001
of AST
and
ALT,|56935002
and
demonstrate
positive Bengal Rose|258758003|82411007|10828004|82411007
and
Huddleston reactions.|263851003

This complex|103360007
is
,
at least
in Portugal,|223675004
known|36692007
as Malta fever.|75702008

During episodes|272128006
of Malta fever,|75702008
melitococcemia
(presence|386397008
of brucellae|26250004
in blood|87612001|119273009
)
can
usually
be
demonstrated
by means of blood culture|30088009
in tryptose medium|255508009
or
Albini medium.|255508009

If
untreated|25265005
,
the disease|64572001
can
give|419582001
origin|255395001
to focalizations
or
become chronic.|90734009

The focalizations
of brucellosis|75702008
occur|272120004
usually
in bones|272673000|128530007
and
joints|39352004|81087007
and
spondylodiscitis|2304001
of lumbar spine|122496007|243932004
accompanied
by sacroiliitis|55146009
is
very characteristic|260358002
of this disease.|64572001

Orchitis|274718005
is
also frequent|70232002
in men.|339947000

Diagnosis|439401001
of brucellosis|75702008
relies
on
:

The disease's sequelae|302049001
are
highly variable|75540009|255372005
and
may
include|55919000
granulomatous hepatitis,|86514004
arthritis,|3723001
spondylitis,|399096009
anaemia,|271737000
leukopenia,|419188005
thrombocytopenia,|415116008
meningitis,|7180009
uveitis,|128473001
optic neuritis,|66760008
endocarditis,|56819008
and
various neurological disorders collectively|256220008|118940003
known|36692007
as neurobrucellosis.

Antibiotics|255631004
like tetracyclines,|282831004
rifampicin,|387159009
and
the aminoglycosides streptomycin|324116004|387223008|14443002|387223008
and
gentamicin|387321007|411310000
are
effective|255403003|254648000
against _Brucella_ bacteria.|26250004|409822003

However,
the use|277889008|419385000
of more|242762006
than one antibiotic|421379005|255631004
is
needed|410525008|103325001
for several weeks,|261028005|258705008
because
the bacteria incubate|409822003
within cells.|4421005

The gold standard treatment|2309006|276239002|2309006|416118004|371256005|276239002|371256005|416118004
for adults|133936004
is
daily intramuscular injections|69620002|76601001
of streptomycin 1 g|387223008|258795003
for 14 days|258703001
and
oral doxycycline 100 mg twice daily|260548002|372478003|427264006|229799001
for 45 days|258703001
(concurrently
).

Gentamicin 5 mg/kg|387321007|411310000
by intramuscular injection|76601001
once daily|69620002
for seven days|420359007|258703001
is
an acceptable substitute
when
streptomycin|387223008
is
not available|103328004
or
difficult to|52925006
obtain.|398092000

Another widely used regimen|394850002
is
doxycycline|372478003
plus rifampin twice daily|387159009|229799001
for
at least six weeks.|276139006|422218008|258705008|263796003|422218008|258705008

This regimen
has
the advantage
of oral administration.|386359008

A triple therapy|76070002|276239002
of doxycycline,|372478003
with rifampin|387159009
and
cotrimoxazole,|398731002
has
been
used|394850002
successfully to
treat|395077000
neurobrucellosis.[11]

Doxycycline|372478003
is
able to|371150009
cross|65145006
the blood?brain barrier,|20245001
but
requires
the addition|260364009
of two other drugs to|420797005|410942007

Ciprofloxacin|392412000
and
cotrimoxazole therapy|398731002|276239002
is
associated|47429007

In brucellic endocarditis,|56819008
surgery|83578000
is
required
for an optimal outcome.|394617004

Even
with optimal antibrucellic therapy,|276239002
relapses|263855007
still
occur|272120004
in 5?10 percent|264706000|118582008|264605009|118582008
of patients|116154003
with Malta fever.|75702008

The main way|63161005
of preventing brucellosis|75702008|116699007|75702008
is
by
using|260676000
fastidious hygiene|284779002
in producing raw milk products,|6304003|3718001|6304003|119321005|6304003|70813002
or
by pasteurizing
all milk|3718001|119321005|70813002
that
is
to
be
ingested|111984006
by human beings,|278412004
either
in its unaltered form|246176004
or
as a derivate,
such as cheese.|102264005

Experiments
have
shown
that cotrimoxazol
and
rifampin|387159009
are
both
safe drugs to|410942007

The United States BW program|223688001|223547005

on three agents|421291004|260872001

was
in advanced development|86005002|278923009
by the end|261782000|422117008
of World War II.

When
the [U.S.|223688001

Air Force]|417696007|417696007|285653008
(/wiki/U.S._Air_Force|223688001|417696007|223688001|417696007|285653008
)
(USAF
)
wanted|410526009
a biological warfare capability,|12893009
the Chemical Corps|441900009
offered|410527000
Agent|260872001
US
in the M114 bomblet,
based|418836005
after the 4-pound|260308009|258693003
bursting|255331008
bomblet
developed
for anthrax|409498004
in World War II.

Though
the capability
was
developed
,
operational testing|83578000|83578000|272393004
indicated|410535002
that
the weapon|312201009
was
less
than desirable,
and
the USAF
termed
it an interim capability
until
replaced|282089006|370124000
by a more effective biological weapon.|242762006|255403003|242762006|254648000

The main drawbacks|63161005
of the M114
with Agent|260872001
US
was
that
it
was
incapacitating
(
the USAF
wanted|410526009

,
the storage stability|48122007|58158008|440276004|58158008

the logistical requirements to
neutralize
a target
were
far higher|46053002|75540009|46053002|371879000
than originally
anticipated

of action|129264002
of several months.|261028005|258706009

The lethality estimate|414135002
was
based|418836005

always
believed
to

In the United States,|223688001
veterinarians|106290006
are
required
to
vaccinate
all young stock,|84422007

reducing|260400001
the chance
of zoonotic transmission.|258150004

This vaccination
is
usually
referred|439980006
to
as
a "

receive
a tattoo
in their ear serving|117590005|1910005
as proof|229796008
of their vaccination status.|408864009

Wild bison|262290003|442982002
and
elk|48289008
in the Greater Yellowstone Area (GYA)|263768009|42798000

in the U.S.|223688001

The recent transmission|6493001|258150004
of brucellosis|75702008
from elk|48289008
to cattle
in Idaho|224057009

how
the GYA

the last remaining reservoir|257687008
in the United States,|223688001
adversely
affecting|247591002|248448006

Eliminating brucellosis|75702008
from this area|42798000
is
a challenge,

are
many viewpoints|260396001

Until the early 20th century|264499004
the disease|64572001
was
endemic
in Malta|223670009
to the point
of it
being
referred to|439980006
as
"
the Maltese fever".|386661006

The link
between the illness|39104002
and
unpasteurised milk|3718001|119321005|70813002
was
established|263748003|385645004
by Temi Zammit.

Today thanks
to a strict regime
of certification
of milk animals|3718001|387961004|119321005|387961004|70813002|387961004
