*Back pain|22913005
*
*
is
pain|22253000
felt|285854004
in the back|123961009|255551008|281213008|302552004|77568009
that usually
originates
from the muscles,|91727004
nerves,|3057000
bones,|272673000|128530007
joints|39352004|81087007
or
other structures|74964007
in the spine.|421060004|44300000|243930007

Back pain|22913005
may
have
a sudden onset|385315009|255363002
or
can
be
a chronic pain|82423001
;
it
can
be
constant
or
intermittent, stay|7087005
in one place|421379005|257557008|421379005|421066005
or
radiate|8754004
to other areas.|74964007|42798000

It
may
be
a dull ache,|263744001|410711009|410708008|410711009
or
a sharp|410707003
or
piercing
or
burning sensation.|90673000

The pain|22253000
may
radiate|8754004
into the arms|40983000
and
hands|85562004
as well as
the legs|30021000
or
feet,|56459004|259051005
and
may
include|55919000
symptoms
other than pain.|22253000

These symptoms
may
include|55919000
tingling,|162249002
weakness|13791008|260407003
or
numbness.|398026008|44077006

Back pain|22913005
is
one|421379005
of humanity's most frequent complaints.|278412004|70232002|409586006

In the U.S.,|223688001
acute low back pain|278862001
(also called lumbago|279039007
is
the fifth most common reason|32088001|72906007|410666004
for physician visits.|309343006

About nine|422113007
out of ten adults|23067006|133936004|420258001|133936004
experience
back pain|22913005
at some point
in their life,|224130005
and
five|421820001
out of ten working adults|23067006|261041009|133936004|420258001|261041009|133936004
have
back pain|22913005
every year.[1]|258707000|259039008

The spine|421060004|44300000|243930007
is
a complex interconnecting network|103360007
of nerves,|3057000
joints,|39352004|81087007
muscles,|91727004
tendons|13024002
and
ligaments,|52082005
all
of which
are
capable
of producing pain.|22253000

Large nerves|255509001|3057000
that
originate
in the spine|421060004|44300000|243930007
and
go
to the legs|30021000
and
arms|40983000
can
make
pain|22253000
radiate|8754004
to the extremities.[2]|66019005|2592007

Back pain|22913005
can
be
divided|422033008
anatomically
:
neck pain,|81680005
middle back pain,|255562008|22913005|399488007|22913005
lower back pain|279039007
or
tailbone pain.|64688005|22253000

By its duration|103335007
:
acute|272118002
(less
than 4 weeks|260308009|258705008
)
,
subacute|19939008
(4 ? 12 weeks|260308009|258705008
)
,
chronic|90734009
(greater|263768009
than 12 weeks|258705008
).

By its cause|134198009
:
nonspecific back pain,|10003008|22913005
back pain|22913005
with radiculopathy
or
spinal stenosis,|76107001
and
back pain|22913005
associated|47429007
with another specific cause|69658003|23981006|69658003|134198009
(
such as infection
or
cancer.|363346000|372087000

Non specific pain|10003008|22253000
indicates|410535002
that
the cause|134198009
is
not
known|36692007
precisely[4]
but
is
believed to
be
due|42752001
from the soft tissues|181607009
such as muscles,|91727004
fascia,|84820005|181772008
and
ligaments.[5]|52082005

Back pain|22913005
is
classified|73504009
according to etiology|134198009
in mechanical|261018001
or
nonspecific back pain|10003008|22913005
and
secondary back pain.|2603003|22913005|81170007|22913005

Approximately 98%|26175008
of back pain patients|22913005|116154003
are
diagnosed|439401001
with nonspecific acute back pain|10003008
which
has
no serious underlying pathology.|42745003|394595002

However,
secondary back pain|2603003|22913005|81170007|22913005
which
is
caused|23981006|134198009
by an underlying condition|260905004
accounts
for nearly 2%
of the cases.|398241000|413769002

Underlying pathology|394595002
in these cases|398241000|413769002
may
include|55919000
metastatic cancer,|405843009|128462008
spinal osteomyelitis|60168000
and
epidural abscess|61974008
which
account
for 1%|260305007
of the patients.|116154003

Also,
herniated disc|73589001
is
the most common neurologic impairment|4757001|72906007|264552009
which
is
associated|47429007
with this condition,|260905004
from which 95%
of disc herniations|414403008
occur|272120004
at the lowest two lumbar intervertebral levels.[6]|62482003|420797005|182343007|264042003|258395000|261122009|420797005|182343007|264042003|258395000|371880002|420797005|182343007|264042003|258395000

Back pain|22913005
does
not usually
require
immediate medical intervention.|88694003|74188005|225334002|49499008|74188005|225334002

The vast majority
of episodes|272128006
of back pain|22913005
are
self-limiting|255469002
and
non-progressive.|255314001

Most back pain syndromes|22913005
are
due to inflammation,|257552002
especially
in the acute phase,|255251009
which typically lasts
from two weeks|420797005|258705008
to three months.|421291004|258706009

Back pain|22913005
can
be
a sign|72670004
of a serious medical problem,|42745003|74188005|55607006
although
this
is
not most frequently|70232002
the underlying cause|134198009
:

A few observational studies|57176003|103705002|110465008|57176003|103705002|224699009
suggest
that two conditions|420797005|260905004
to which back pain|22913005
is
often|70232002
attributed,|246061005
lumbar disc herniation|202708005
and
degenerative disc disease|77547008
may
not
be
more prevalent|242762006
among those in pain|52101004|22253000|18720000|22253000
than
among the general population,|60132005|385436007|60132005|389109008
and
that
the mechanisms|257544000
by which
these conditions|260905004
might
cause|23981006|134198009
pain|22253000
are
not
known.|36692007

Other studies|74964007|110465008|74964007|224699009
suggest
that
for
as
many
as 85%
of cases,|398241000|413769002
no physiological cause|1360005|134198009
can
be
shown.[11][12]

A few studies|57176003|110465008|57176003|224699009
suggest
that psychosocial factors
such as on-|420771004|420862001
the-job stress|14679004|262188008
and
dysfunctional family relationships|386585008|35359004|272151006
may
correlate
more closely|242762006
with back pain|22913005
than structural abnormalities|276654001
revealed|263857004
in x-rays|52250000|168537006
and
other medical imaging scans.[13][14][15][16]|74964007|278395004

There
are
several potential sources|261028005|30207005|260753009
and
causes|134198009
of back pain.|22913005

However,
the diagnosis|439401001
of specific tissues|69658003|85756007
of the spine|421060004|44300000|243930007
as the cause|134198009
of pain|22253000
presents|52101004|246105001
problems.|55607006

This
is
because symptoms
arising|68727004
from different spinal tissues|263735002|85756007
can
feel|285854004
very similar|260358002
and
is
difficult to|52925006
differentiate|263933003
without the use|277889008|419385000
of invasive diagnostic intervention procedures,|10179008|103693007|225334002
such as local anesthetic blocks.|386761002|26036001|373477003|26036001

One potential source|421379005|30207005|260753009
of back pain|22913005
is
skeletal muscle|127954009|244716004
of the back.|123961009|255551008|281213008|302552004|77568009

Potential causes|30207005|134198009
of pain|22253000
in muscle tissue|91727004
include|55919000
muscle strains|48532005
(pulled muscles|48532005
)
,
muscle spasm,|45352006
and
muscle imbalances.|91727004

However,
imaging studies|363679005|110465008|363679005|224699009|278395004|110465008|278395004|224699009
do
not
support|9096001|243114000
the notion
of muscle tissue damage|85756007|91727004|37782003|91727004|37782003
in many back pain cases,|260396001|22913005|398241000|260396001|22913005|413769002
and
the neurophysiology
of muscle spasm|45352006
and
muscle imbalances|91727004
is
not well understood.|20572008|66216009

Another potential source|30207005|260753009
of lower back pain|279039007
is
the synovial joints|334886004|113234001
of the spine|421060004|44300000|243930007
(e.g.|258795003

zygapophysial joints/facet joints.|81168003|81168003

These
have
been
identified|7882003
as the primary source|63161005|260753009|261424001|260753009
of the pain|22253000
in approximately|26175008
one|421379005
third|70905002
of people|125676002
with chronic low back pain,|278860009
and
in most people|125676002
with neck pain|81680005
following|255260001
whiplash.[17]However,|39848009
the cause|134198009
of zygapophysial joint pain|57676002|81168003|22253000|89836005|22253000
is
not fully
understood.|66216009

Capsule tissue damage|385049006|37782003|428641000|37782003
has
been
proposed
in people|125676002
with neck pain|81680005
following|255260001
whiplash.|39848009

In people|125676002
with spinal pain stemming|22253000
from zygapophysial joints,|81168003
one theory|421379005
is
that intra-articular tissue|12130007|85756007|131183008|85756007
such as invaginations|41444002
of their synovial membranes|64331004
and
fibro-adipose meniscoids|414915002
(
that usually
act
as a cushion to
help
the bones|272673000|128530007
move|302000008|384598002|370125004
over each other smoothly
)
may
become
displaced, pinched|263739008|242905004
or
trapped,|403833009
and
consequently
give|419582001
rise
to nociception
(pain|22253000
).

There
are
several common other potential sources|261028005|72906007|30207005|260753009
and
causes|134198009
of back pain|22913005
:
these
include|55919000
spinal disc herniation|414403008
and
degenerative disc disease|77547008
or
isthmic spondylolisthesis,|203683004
osteoarthritis|396275006
(degenerative joint disease|396275006
)
and
lumbar spinal stenosis,|18347007
trauma,
cancer,|363346000|372087000
infection,
fractures,|125605004
and
inflammatory disease.|128139000

The anterior ligaments|255549009|52082005
of the intervertebral disc|360499006|244570000
are
extremely sensitive,|83185005
and
even
the slightest injury|255510006|255604002
can
cause|23981006|134198009
significant pain.[19]|386134007|22253000

Radicular pain|11679003
(sciatica|23056005
is
distinguished
from 'non-specific' back pain,|10003008|22913005
and
may
be
diagnosed|439401001
without invasive diagnostic tests.|10179008|103693007

New attention|7147002|6769007
has
been
focused|87017008|363702006
on _non-discogenic back pain_,|22913005
where patients|116154003
have
normal|17621005|258744000
or
near-normal MRI|277752003|169082008
and
CT scans.|77477000

One|421379005
of the newer investigations|7147002|386053000
looks|386548000
into the role
of the dorsal ramus|113316003
in patients|116154003
that
have
no radiographic abnormalities.|258106000|276654001

See|281004000
Posterior Rami Syndrome.|255551008

In the most common cases|4757001|72906007|398241000|4757001|72906007|413769002
of low back pain,|279039007
professional organizations|21139007
recommend
that physicians|309343006
not immediately|49499008
seek
a diagnosis|439401001
but
instead
begin|255395001
treatment to|276239002|416118004
reduce|260400001
pain.|22253000

This assumes
that
the physician|309343006
has
no reason to|410666004
expect
that
the patient|116154003
has
an underlying problem.|55607006

In most cases,|398241000|413769002
the pain goes away naturally|22253000
after a few weeks.|57176003|258705008

Research
has
shown
that typical patients|116154003
who
do
seek
diagnosis|439401001
through imaging|363679005|278395004
are
not likely to|2931005
have
a better outcome|3442003|394617004
than patients|116154003
who
wait
for the condition to|260905004
resolve.[22][23][24]|264657009

In cases|398241000|413769002
in which
the back pain|22913005
has
a persistent underlying cause,|134198009
such as a
a specific disease|69658003|64572001
or
spinal abnormality,|276654001
then
it
is
necessary
for the physician to|309343006
differentiate|263933003
the source|260753009
of the pain|22253000
and
advise specific courses|424900004|69658003|288524001
of treatment.|276239002|416118004

The management goals|413454004|410518001|119270007|410518001
when
treating|28995006
back pain|22913005
are
to
achieve
maximal reduction|56851009|58294000|56851009|260400001|56851009|289928003|398303009|58294000|398303009|260400001|398303009|289928003
in pain intensity|406127006
as
rapidly|418694008
as possible|371930009|60022001
;
to
restore
the individual's ability to|125676002|371150009|385435006|371150009
function|246464006
in everyday activities|69620002|257733005
;
to
help
the patient|116154003
cope|405056001
with residual pain|65320000|22253000
;
to
assess
for side-effects
of therapy|276239002
;
and
to
facilitate
the patient's passage|116154003|255592004
through the legal|398165009
and
socioeconomic impediments
to recovery.

For many,|260396001
the goal|410518001
is
to
keep
the pain|22253000
to a manageable level to|258395000|276625007
progress|385651009
with rehabilitation,|52052004|394602003
which then
can
lead|88488004
to long term pain relief.|182970005

Also,
for some people|125676002
the goal|410518001
is
to
use|277889008|419385000
non-surgical therapies to|83578000|276239002
manage|119270007
the pain|22253000
and
avoid
major surgery,|255603008|83578000
while
for others surgery|74964007|83578000
may
be
the quickest way to|255358001
feel|285854004
better.|3442003

Not
all treatments|276239002
work|261041009
for all
conditions|78326006|260905004
or
for all individuals|125676002|385435006
with the same condition,|262126009|260905004
and
many
find
that
they
need|410525008|103325001
to
try
several treatment options to|261028005|276239002|261028005|416118004
determine
what
works|261041009
best
for them.

The present stage|52101004|21191007|52101004|371508000|52101004|261612004|246105001|21191007|246105001|371508000|246105001|261612004
of the condition|260905004
(acute|272118002
or
chronic|90734009
)
is
also
a determining factor
in the choice
of treatment.|276239002|416118004

Only
a minority|410599005|255606000
of back pain patients|22913005|116154003
(
most estimates|414135002
are
1% - 10%|260305007
)
require
surgery.|83578000

Depending
on the particular cause|134198009
of the condition,|260905004
posture training courses|229069003|288524001
and
physical exercises|61686008
might
help
with relieving|1241001|397855004|398004007
the pain.|22253000

Surgery|83578000
may
sometimes
be
appropriate
for patients|116154003
with
:

Surgery|83578000
is
usually
the last resort
in the treatment|276239002|416118004
of back pain.|22913005

It
is
usually only
recommended
if
all other treatment options|74964007|276239002|74964007|416118004
have
been
tried
or
in an emergency situation.|25876001

A 2009 systematic review|415300000
of
back surgery studies|83578000|110465008|83578000|224699009
found|404684003
that,
for certain diagnoses,|17162000|439401001
surgery|83578000
is
moderately better|3442003
than other common treatments,|74964007|72906007|276239002
but
the benefits
of surgery often|83578000|70232002
decline
in the long term.[43]

There
are
different types|263735002|261664005
of surgical procedures|83578000
that
are
used|394850002
in treating various conditions|28995006|256220008|260905004
causing|23981006
back pain.|22913005

All
of them
can
be
classified|73504009
into nerve decompression,|38135000
fusion|31883006|122501008
of body segments|279495008|264193005|123037004|264193005
and
deformity correction surgeries.|276654001|83578000|127560004|83578000|417893002|83578000

The first type|255216001|261664005|232714002|261664005
of surgery|83578000
is
primarily
performed|398166005
in older patients|70753007|116154003
who
suffer
from conditions|260905004
causing|23981006
nerve irritation|3057000|257553007|256864008|257553007
or
nerve damage.|57182000

Fusion|31883006|122501008
of bony segments|263686003|264193005
is
also
referred|439980006
to
as
a spinal fusion,|55705006
and
it
is
a procedure|71388002
used|394850002
to
fuse
together two|420797005
or
more bony fragments|242762006|263686003|29140007
with the
help
of metalwork.

The latter type|261664005
of surgery|83578000
is
normally
performed|398166005
to correct congenital deformities|276654001
or
those that
were
caused|23981006|134198009
by a traumatic fracture.|263904004|125605004

In some cases,|398241000|413769002
correction
of deformities|276654001
involves|248448006
removing bony fragments|127485006|263686003|29140007
or
providing stability provision|58158008
for the spine.|421060004|44300000|243930007

The main procedures|63161005|71388002
used|394850002
in back pain surgery|22913005|83578000
are
discetomies,
spinal fusions,|55705006
laminectomies,|387731002
removal|118292001|128303001
of tumors,|108369006
and
vertebroplasties.|401226007

A discetomy
is
performed|398166005
when
the intervertebral disc|360499006|244570000
have
herniated
or
torn.|312608009

It
involves|248448006
removing|127485006
the protruding disc,|112639008
either
a portion|260726005
of it
or
all
of it,
that
is
placing|257557008
pressure|279046003|13543005|257893003
on the nerve root.|40958000

The disc material|260769002
which
is
putting
pressure|279046003|13543005|257893003
on the nerve|3057000|256864008
is
removed|127485006
through a small incision|255507004|34896006
that
is
made over|21481007
that particular disc.

This
is
one|421379005
of the most popular types|4757001|261664005
of
back surgeries|83578000
and
which also
has
a high rate|75540009|371879000
of success.|385669000

The recovery period|259037005
after this procedure|71388002
does
not
last
longer|255511005
than 6 weeks.|258705008

The type|261664005
of procedure|71388002
in which
the bony fragments|263686003|29140007
are
removed|127485006
through an endoscope|37270008
is
called percutaneous disc removal.|103388001|118292001|103388001|128303001

Microdiscetomies
may
be
performed|398166005
as a variation|40885006
of standard discetomies
in which
a magnifier|264865009
is
used to|394850002
provide
the advantage
of a smaller incision,|263796003|34896006|255507004|34896006
thus
a shorter recovery process.|359530003|415178003|367450005|415178003

Spinal fusions|55705006
are
performed|398166005
in cases|398241000|413769002
in which
the patient|116154003
has
had
the entire disc|255503000|260232004
removed|127485006
or
when
another condition|260905004
has
caused|23981006|134198009
the vertebrae to|420345000
become
unstable.|263922001

The procedure|71388002
consists
in uniting two|420797005
or
more vertebrae|242762006|420345000
by
using|260676000
bone grafts|80983001|409248003
and
metalwork to
provide
more strength|242762006|260404005
for the healing bone.|405043008

Recovery
after spinal fusion|55705006
may
take up|419652001|255532002|419652001|353734004
to one year,|421379005|258707000|421379005|259039008
depending
greatly
on the age|424144002
of the patient,|116154003
the reason|410666004
why surgery|83578000
has
been
performed|398166005
and
how
many bony segments|263686003|264193005
needed|410525008|103325001
to
be
fused.

In cases|398241000|413769002
of spinal stenosis|76107001
or
disc herniation,|414403008
laminectomies|387731002
can
be
performed|398166005
to
relieve|397855004
the pressure|279046003|13543005|257893003
on the nerves.|3057000

During such
a procedure,|71388002
the surgeon|304292004
enlarges|260376009|118452000
the spinal canal|61853006
by removing|127485006
or
trimming away|8378006
the lamina|88446008
which
will
provide
more space|242762006
for the nerves.|3057000

The severity|272141005
of the condition|260905004
as well as
the general health status|105724001|263490005|60132005|406221003
of the patient|116154003
are
key factors
in establishing|263748003
the recovery time,|410669006
which
may
be
range
from 8 weeks|258705008
to 6 months.|258706009

Back surgery|83578000
can
be
performed|398166005
to
prevent
the growth
of benign|30807003
and
malignant tumors.|363346000

In the first case,|255216001|398241000|232714002|398241000
surgery|83578000
has
the goal|410518001
of relieving|1241001|397855004|398004007
the pressure|279046003|13543005|257893003
from the nerves|3057000
which
is
caused|23981006|134198009
by a benign growth,|30807003
whereas
in the latter
the procedure|71388002
is
aimed to
prevent
the
spread|410677005
of cancer|363346000|372087000
to other areas|74964007|42798000
of the body.|279495008|123037004

Recovery
depends
on the type|261664005
of tumor|108369006
that
is
being
removed,|127485006
the health status|406221003
of the patient|116154003
and
the size|277049003
of the tumor.|108369006

About 50%
of women|224526002
experience
low back pain|279039007
during pregnancy.|289908002

Back pain|22913005
in pregnancy|289908002
may
be
severe enough to|24484000
cause|23981006|134198009
significant pain|386134007|22253000
and
disability|21134002
and
pre-dispose|236874000|272113006
patients|116154003
to back pain|22913005
in a following pregnancy.|255260001|289908002

No significant increased risk|386134007|35105006|30207005|386134007|260366006|30207005
of back pain|22913005
with pregnancy|289908002
has
been
found|404684003
with respect
to maternal weight gain,|72705000|262286000
exercise,|61686008
work satisfaction,|261041009
or
pregnancy outcome factors|289908002|394617004
such as birth weight,|47340003
birth length,|169886007
and
Apgar scores.|302083008

Biomechanical factors
of pregnancy|289908002
that
are
shown
to
be
associated|47429007
with low back pain|279039007
of pregnancy|289908002
include|55919000
abdominal sagittal|277112006|30730003
and
transverse diameter|62824007|81827009|243899009|81827009
and
the depth|131197000
of lumbar lordosis.|182343007|61960001

Typical factors
aggravating|162473008
the back pain|22913005
of pregnancy|289908002
include|55919000
standing,|10904000
sitting|33586001
,
forward bending,|417188003
lifting|258141001
,
and
walking.|129006008

Back pain|22913005
in pregnancy|289908002
may
also
be
characterized
by pain radiating|9972008
into the thigh|68367000|302544002
and
buttocks,|46862004
night-time pain severe enough to|36163009|410669006|24484000|2546009|22253000|24484000
wake|255377004|307156004
the patient,|116154003
pain|22253000
that
is
increased|35105006|260366006
during the night-time,|2546009
or
pain|22253000
that
is
increased|35105006|260366006
during the day-time.|258703001|410669006|259032004|410669006

The avoidance
of high impact,|75540009|134293005|371879000|134293005
weight-bearing activities|249981005|257733005
and
especially
those
that asymmetrically
load
the involved structures|248448006
such as
:
extensive twisting|41118005|51795009|41118005|129256008
with lifting,|258141001
single-leg stance postures,|125681006|61685007|363855006|125681006|30021000|363855006|125681006|182281004|363855006|125681006|362793004|363855006|50607009|61685007|363855006|50607009|30021000|363855006|50607009|182281004|363855006|50607009|362793004|363855006
stair climbing,|258145005
and
repetitive motions|56219004|272149007
at
or
near the end-ranges|261782000|422117008
of
back
or
hip motion|29836001|56219004|85710004|56219004
can
ease
the pain.|22253000

Direct bending|255589003|89684003|255589003|282977007
to the ground
without bending|89684003|282977007
the knee|304679005|49076000|361291001|72696002
causes|134198009
severe impact|24484000|134293005
on the lower back|37822005|264072009
in pregnancy|289908002
and
in normal individuals,|17621005|125676002|17621005|385435006|258744000|125676002|258744000|385435006
which
leads|88488004|236874000
to
strain|48532005|276768000
,
especially
in the lumbo-saccral region|410673009
that in turn|282987006
strains|48532005|276768000
the multifidus.|5709001|244871009

Back pain|22913005
is
regularly
cited
by national governments
as
having
a major impact|255603008|134293005
on productivity,
through loss
of workers|106541005
on sick leave.|7771000|90737002

Some national governments,
notably Australia|223621005
and
the United Kingdom,|223860005
have
launched campaigns
of public health awareness to|310115006|312012004
help
combat
the problem,|55607006
for example
the Health|263775005
and
Safety Executive's Better Backs campaign.|3442003|123961009

In the United States lower back pain?s economic impact|223688001|279039007|134293005
reveals|263857004
that
it
is
the number one reason|410680006|421379005|410666004|410681005|421379005|410666004
for individuals|125676002|385435006
under the age|424144002
of 45 to
limit|255469002
their activity,|48761009|55561003|258745004|257733005
