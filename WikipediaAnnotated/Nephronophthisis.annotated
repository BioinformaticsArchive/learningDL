*Nephronophthisis|204958008
*
*
is
a genetic disorder|32895009
of the kidneys|64033007|17373004
which
affects|4065008
children.|410601007|160499008

It
is
classified|73504009
as a medullary cystic kidney disease.|204958008

The disorder|64572001
is
inherited|255404009
in an autosomal recessive fashion|258211005
and
,
although
rare,|84638005|103356009
is
the most common genetic cause|4757001|72906007|3950001|134198009|4757001|72906007|255395001|134198009
of childhood kidney failure.|68433009|42399005

It
is
a form|246176004
of ciliopathy.[1]

Its incidence
has
been
estimated|414135002
to
be
0.9
per million people|125676002
in the United States,|223688001
and
1
in 50.000 births|3950001
in Canada.[2]|223686002

Infantile, juvenile,|3658006|133937008|263784005|133937008
and
adolescent forms|133937008|246176004
of nephronophthisis|204958008
have
been
identified.|7882003

Although
the range
of characterizations
is
broad, patients typically|90522003|116154003
present|52101004|246105001
with polyuria|28442001
(production
of large volume|255509001|118565006|255509001|419569009
of urine|78014005
)
,
polydipsia
(excessive liquid intake|260378005|33463005|260378005|264312008
)
,
and
mild proteinuria|255604002|29738008
(
the abnormal appearance
of protein|88878007
in the urine|78014005
)
,
and
after several months|261028005|258706009
to years,|258707000
end-stage kidney disease,|46177005|433146000
a condition necessitating|260905004
either
dialysis|108241001|265764009
or
a kidney transplant|70536003|70948008
in order to
survive.

Approximately 10%|26175008
of individuals|125676002|385435006
with nephronophthisis also|204958008
have
so-called "extra-renal symptoms"|223528007|64033007
which
can
include|55919000
blindness,
liver problems,|300338006
severe global developmental delay|24484000|224958001
or
mental retardation,|91138005
and
neurologic involvement|1199008|248448006
in which
the cerebellum|113305005|180924008
is
affected.|247591002|248448006

Histologically,|67151002
nephronophthisis|204958008
is
characterized
by fibrosis|263756000
and
the formation|11798007|255277001
of cysts|441457006
in a specific region|69658003|410673009
of the kidney.|64033007|17373004|181414000

In contrast
to other cystic diseases|74964007
of the kidney|64033007|17373004|181414000
in which
the kidneys|64033007|17373004
are
larger|255509001|263768009
than usual,
in nephronophthisis|204958008
the kidneys|64033007|17373004
are
small|255507004
to normal|17621005|258744000
in size.|277049003

From sequencing
the DNA|24851008
of individuals|125676002|385435006
and
families|35359004
with nephronophthisis,|204958008
scientists|308027003
have
identified|7882003
thus far 8 different genes|46053002|263735002|67271001
in which mutations|55446002
can
cause|23981006|134198009
the disease.|64572001

These genes|67271001
are
called
NPHP1,|444830001
NPHP2,|444558002
NPHP3,|444749006
NPHP4,
NPHP5,
NPHP6,
NPHP7,
and
NPHP8,
and
the proteins|88878007
for which
they
encode
are
known|36692007
as the nephrocystins.

Although
the biological function
of these proteins|88878007
is
not yet
known|36692007
,
they
all
localize|255471002
at least
in part|260726005
to an organelle|116194001
in the cell|4421005|362837007
called
the primary cilia.|63161005|69315009|63161005|85803001|261424001|69315009|261424001|85803001

Recent findings|6493001|404684003|6493001
in genetic research|3950001|255395001
have
suggested
that
a large number|255509001|410680006|255509001|410681005
of genetic disorders,|32895009
both
genetic syndromes|290028006
and
genetic diseases,|429962007
that
were
not previously
identified|7882003
in the medical literature|74188005
as
related,|272151006|262094002
may
be
,
in fact,
highly|75540009
related|272151006|262094002
in the genetypical root cause|85077000|134198009|2338009|134198009
of the widely-varying, phenotypically-observed disorders.|64572001

Thus,
Nephronophthisis|204958008
is
a ciliopathy.

Other known ciliopathies|74964007|36692007
include|55919000
primary ciliary dyskinesia,|86204009|42402006
Bardet-Biedl syndrome,|5619004
polycystic kidney
and
liver disease,|235856003
Alstrom syndrome,|63702009
Meckel-Gruber syndrome|29076005
and
some
forms|246176004
of retinal degeneration.[3]|95695004
