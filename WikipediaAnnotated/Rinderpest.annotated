*
*
(also

)
was
an infectious viral disease|191415002
of cattle,
domestic buffalo,|261770009|424878006
and
some other species|74964007|69658003
of even-toed ungulates,|3157002|29707007|3157002|302547009
including|55919000
buffaloes,|424878006
large antelopes|255509001|107010006
and
deer,|107003000
giraffes,|19646001
wildebeests|423020008
and
warthogs.|422909004

After a global eradication campaign,|60132005
the last confirmed case|59156000|398241000
of rinderpest|40440002
was
diagnosed|439401001
in 2001.

The disease|64572001
was
characterized
by fever,|386661006
oral erosions,|260548002|15498001
diarrhea,|398032003
lymphoid necrosis,|38000004|6574001
and
high mortality.|75540009|409651001|371879000|409651001

On 14 October 2010,
the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization|255620007|21139007
announced
that field activities|255798002|257733005
in the decades-long, worldwide|255511005
campaign
to
eradicate
the disease|64572001
were
ending,|261782000|422117008
paving
the way
for a formal declaration|246176004
in June 2011
of the global eradication|60132005
of rinderpest.|40440002

On 25 May 2011,
the World Organisation for Animal Health|21139007|387961004|263775005
announced
the free status|37837009|263490005
of the last eight countries|421825006|223369002
not yet
recognized
,
and
said|66049007
a total|258755000|255619001
of 198 countries|223369002
were
now free|37837009
of the disease.|64572001

On 8 August 2011,
the United Nations
held|421139008
a ceremony declaring
the disease|64572001
eradicated
,
making
rinderpest only|40440002
the second disease|48873002
in history to|392521001
be
fully
wiped
out,|255529000
following|255260001
smallpox.[5]|67924001|243568000

The term _rinderpest_|40440002
is
a German word meaning "cattle-plague".[1][6]|7695005|255373000|40440002

As
it
is
a _Morbillivirus_,|83313003
the rinderpest virus (RPV)|73376006
is
closely
related|272151006|262094002
to the measles|14189004
and
canine distemper viruses.|39721003

Despite its extreme lethality,|12565001
the virus|49872002
is
particularly fragile|59955000
and
is
quickly
inactivated
by heat,|88999006
desiccation|257791009
and
sunlight.[8]|49926000

The measles virus|52584002
evolved|59381007
from the then-widespread rinderpest virus most probably|85333001|73376006
between the 11th
and
12th centuries.

The earliest likely origin|264499004|2931005|255395001
is
within the seventh century|86777004
:
for this earlier origin there|264499004|255395001
is
some linguistic evidence.[10][11]|18669006

Death rates|409651001
during outbreaks|443684005
were
usually extremely high,|75540009|371879000
approaching
100%
in immunologically na?ve populations.|385432009|223724006|385436007

The disease|64572001
was
mainly
spread|410677005
by direct contact|255589003|11723008|255589003|70862002
and
by drinking contaminated water,|160573003|102414000|30953006|102414000
although
it
could
also
be
transmitted|60117003|258150004
by air.[13]|417696007

Initial symptoms|884001|232714002
include|55919000
fever,|386661006
loss
of appetite,|33911006
and
nasal|260540009
and
eye discharges.|246679005

Subsequently,
irregular erosions|49608001|15498001
appear
in the mouth,|74262004|123851003|21082005|181220002
the lining|50009006
of the nose,|260540009|181195007
and
the genital tract.|263767004

Acute diarrhea,|409966000
preceded|236874000
by constipation,|14760008
is
also
a common feature.|72906007

Most animals|387961004
die|419620001|399069006|419099009
six|422218008
to 12 days|258703001
after the onset|77374008
of these clinical signs.[12]|58147004|72670004

The disease|64572001
is
believed to
have
originated
in Asia,|223500001
later
spreading|410677005
through the transport|57188001|360300001
of cattle.

Other cattle epizootics|74964007
are
noted
in ancient times|410669006|417929005
:
a cattle plague|40440002
is
one|421379005
of the ten plagues|23067006|58750007|420258001|58750007
of Egypt|223511009
described
in the Hebrew Bible.

By
around 3,000 BC,|260313008
a cattle plague|40440002
had
reached Egypt,|282679008|223511009
and
rinderpest later|40440002
spread|410677005
throughout the remainder
of Africa,|223498002
following|255260001
European colonization.[6]|414152003

Cattle plagues|40440002
recurred|246455001
throughout history,|392521001
often accompanying wars|70232002
and
military campaigns.|302314004

They
hit|30166007
Europe|223502009
especially hard|72505002
in the 18th century,
with three long pandemics|421291004|255511005
which,
although
varying
in intensity|103370009
and
duration|103335007
from region|410673009
to region,|410673009
took|419652001
place|257557008|421066005
in the periods|259037005
of 1709?1720,
1742?1760,
and
1768?1786.

There
was
a major outbreak|255603008|443684005
covering|255334000
the whole|260232004
of Britain
in 1865/66.

Later|260383002
in history,|392521001
an outbreak|443684005
in the 1890s
killed|248007002
80
to 90%|264705001|264703008
of all cattle
in southern Africa,|223549008
as well as
in the Horn|69221006
of Africa.|223498002

Sir Arnold Theiler
was
instrumental
in developing
a vaccine|398827000
that
curbed|54132002
the epidemic.

More recently,|242762006|6493001
a rinderpest outbreak|40440002|443684005
that
raged
across much|242762006|4757001
of Africa|223498002
in 1982?1984 cost
at least
an estimated|414135002
US$500 million
in stock losses.

In the early 18th century,|264499004
the disease|64572001
was
seen
as similar
to smallpox,|67924001|243568000
due to its analogous symptoms.

The personal physician|309343006
of the Pope,
Giovanni Maria Lancisi,
recommended
the slaughter
of all
infected
and
exposed animals.|24932003|387961004

This policy
was
not very popular|260358002
and
used|394850002
only sparingly|50607009|420883007|420295001|420883007
in the first part|255216001|260726005|232714002|260726005
of the century.

Later,
it
was
used|394850002
successfully
in several countries,|261028005|223369002
although
it
was
sometimes
seen
as too costly
or
drastic,
and
depended
on a strong central authority to|260404005|26216008
be
effective|255403003|254648000
(
something which
was
notably
lacking|41277001
in the Dutch Republic.|9533000

Because of these downsides,
numerous attempts|260396001
were
made
to
inoculate
animals|387961004
against the disease.|64572001

These attempts
met|229057006
with varying success,|385669000
but
the procedure|71388002
was
not widely
used|394850002
and
was
no longer|255511005
practiced
at all
in 19th-century Western
or
Central Europe.|26216008|223502009

Rinderpest|40440002
was
an immense problem,|55607006
but
inoculation
was
not
a valid solution|8537005|77899000
:
In many cases,|398241000|413769002
it
caused too many losses.|23981006|134198009

Even more importantly,
it
perpetuated
the circulation|413854007
of the virus|49872002
in the cattle population.|385436007|389109008

The pioneers
of inoculation
did
contribute
significantly
to our knowledge|225795001
about infectious diseases.|191415002

Their experiments
confirmed|59156000
the concepts
of those
who saw infectious diseases|281004000|191415002|191415002
as
caused|23981006|134198009
by specific agents,|69658003|260872001
and
were
the first to|255216001|232714002
recognize
maternally derived immunity#Naturally_acquired_passive_immunity|58915005|255396000|112122005
).[7]

The first written report|255216001|12261009|229059009|255216001|12261009|223458004|232714002|12261009|229059009|232714002|12261009|223458004
of rinderpest inoculation|40440002
was
published
in a letter signed 'T.S.'|126202002|72670004
in the November 1754 issue|55607006
of _
The Gentleman's Magazine_,
[7]
a widely read journal|50360004|433497004
which also
supported|9096001|243114000
the progress|385651009
of smallpox inoculation.|67924001|243568000

This letter|126202002
reported|229059009|223458004
that
a Mr.

Dobsen
had
inoculated
his cattle
and
had
thus preserved nine|277405005|422113007
out of ten|23067006|420258001
of them,
although
this
was
retracted|37794007
in the next issue|18769003|55607006|255260001|55607006
as
it
was
apparently
a Sir William St.

Quintin
who
had
done
the inoculating
(
this
was
done
by placing|257557008
bits
of material previously|260769002
dipped|249558002|315316004
in morbid discharge|307488001|58000006
into an incision|34896006
made
in the dewlap|13622004
of the animal|387961004
).

These letters|126202002
encouraged
further application|46053002|410618006
of inoculation
in the fight|248005005
against diseases.|64572001

The first inoculation|255216001|232714002
against measles|14189004
was
made
three years|421291004|258707000
after their publication.[7]

From early 1755 onwards,|264499004
experiments
were
taking place|419652001|257557008|419652001|421066005
in the Netherlands,|223672001
as well,|20572008
results|394617004
of which
were
also
published
in _
The Gentleman's Magazine_.

As
in England,|223664003
the disease|64572001
was
seen
as analogous
with smallpox.|67924001|243568000

While
these experiments
were
reasonably successful,|385669000
they
did
not
have
a significant impact|386134007|134293005
:
The total number|258755000|410680006|258755000|410681005|255619001|410680006|255619001|410681005
of inoculations
in England|223664003
appears
to
have
been
very|260358002
limited,|255469002
and
after 1780
the English interest|297487008|225469004|25804004|225469004
in inoculation
disappeared
almost entirely.

Almost all further experimentation|46053002
was
done
in the Netherlands,|223672001
Northern Germany|223637004
and
Denmark.|223663009

Due to a very severe outbreak|260358002|24484000|443684005
at the end|261782000|422117008
of the 1760s,
some
of the biggest names|255509001|263768009
in Dutch medicine|9533000|410942007
became
involved|248448006
in the struggle
against the disease.|64572001

Several independent trials|261028005|371153006|110465008
were
begun|255395001
,
most notably
by Pieter Camper
in Groningen
and
Friesland.

The results|394617004
of his experiment
in Friesland
were
encouraging,
but
they
proved|277025001
to
be
the exception
:
testing|272393004
by others|74964007
in the provinces
of Utrecht,
Leeuwarden
and
Friesland
obtained|398092000
disastrous results.|394617004

As a result,|394617004
the Frisian authorities
concluded
in 1769
that
the cause|134198009
of rinderpest|40440002
was
God's displeasure
with the sinful behavior|844005
of the Frisian people,|125676002
and
proclaimed
15 November
a day|258703001|259032004
of fasting|16985007
and
prayer.

Interest|225469004
in inoculation
declined
sharply
across the country.[7]|223369002

In this climate
of discouragement
and
scepticism,
Geert Reinders,
a farmer|106388008
in the province
of Groningen
and
a self-taught man,|264939006|248153007|264939006|339947000|264939006|278412004
decided
to
continue|255238004
the experiments.

He
collaborated
with Wijnold Munniks,
who
had
supervised
earlier trials.|264499004|110465008

They
tried
different inoculation procedures|263735002|71388002
and
a variety
of treatments to|276239002
lighten|80228000
the symptoms,
all
of them
without significant effect.|386134007|253861007

Although
they
were
not able to|371150009
perfect
the inoculation procedure,|71388002
they
did
make
some useful observations.[7]|103705002

Reinders
resumed
his experiments
in 1774,
concentrating
on the inoculation
of calves|53840002|244015008
from cows|34618005
that
had
recovered|74822006
from rinderpest.|40440002

He
was
probably
the first to|255216001|232714002
make
practical use|277889008|419385000
of maternally derived immunity.|58915005

The detailed results|394617004
of his trials|110465008
were
published
in 1776
and
reprinted
in 1777.

His inoculation procedure|71388002
did
not
differ
much
from what
had
been
used|394850002
previously,
except for the use|277889008|419385000
of three separate inoculations|421291004|263869007
at an early age.|264499004|424144002

This produced far better results,|46053002|3442003|394617004
and
the publication
of his work renewed interest|261041009|225469004
in inoculation.

For the period|259037005
of 1777
to 1781,
89%
of inoculated animals|387961004
survived
,
compared
to a 29% survival rate
after natural infection.[7]|510009

In the Netherlands,|223672001
too,
interest|225469004
in rinderpest inoculation|40440002
declined
in the 1780s
because
the disease|64572001
itself
decreased|1250004|260400001|260371004
in intensity.|103370009

Apart from the Dutch republic,|9533000
the only other regions|50607009|410673009|420295001|410673009
where inoculation
was
used|394850002
to any significant level|386134007|258395000|386134007|276625007
were
northern Germany|223637004
and
Denmark.|223663009

Experiments
started|385652002
in Mecklenburg
during the epizootic
of the late 1770s.|260383002

'Insurance companies'
were
created
which
provided
inoculation
in special '|67995009
institutes|385437003
'.

Although
these
were
private initiatives,|247756008
they
were
created
with full encouragement|261015003
from the authorities.

Even
though
neighboring states|40415009|398070004
followed|367409002
this practice
with interest,|225469004
the practice never
caught|30623001|282673009
on
outside of Mecklenburg
;
many
were
still
opposed
to inoculation.[7]

While
some experimentation
occurred|272120004
in other countries|74964007|223369002
(most extensively|4757001
in Denmark|223663009
)
,
in the majority
of European countries,|223633000
the struggle
against the disease|64572001
was
based|418836005
on stamping
it out.|255529000

Sometimes
this
could
be
done
with minimal sacrifices|255605001|255604002
;
at other times,|74964007|410669006|74964007|417929005
it
required slaughter
at a massive scale.[7]|46998006|19892000|46998006|278111002

In his classic study|255301002|110465008|255301002|224699009|255333006|110465008|255333006|224699009

suggested rinderpest|40440002
might
have
affected|247591002|248448006
the Nuer's social organization|21139007
prior to
and
during the 1930s.

Since
the Nuer
were
pastoralists,
much
of their livelihood
was
based|418836005
on cattle husbandry,
and
bride-prices
were
paid
in cattle
;
prices
may
have
changed|243326001|263703002
as a result|394617004
of cattle depletion.|69251000

Rinderpest|40440002
might
also
have
increased dependence|35105006|255338002|260366006|255338002
on horticulture
among the Nuer.[15]

Dr.|309343006

Walter Plowright
was
awarded
the World Food Prize|255620007
in 1999
for developing
a vaccine|398827000
against rinderpest.|40440002

Development work|278923009|261041009
on the Plowright vaccine|398827000
for the RBOK strain|48532005|276768000
of the rinderpest virus|73376006
lasted
from about 1956
to 1962.[16]

In 1999,
the FAO
predicted
that
with vaccination,
rinderpest|40440002
would
be
eradicated
by 2010.[17]

Widespread eradication efforts|85333001|19487008
took|419652001
place|257557008|421066005
as soon
as the early 1900s|264499004
;
in 1924,
the World Organisation for Animal Health|21139007|387961004|263775005
(OIE
)
was
formed|35810008
in response to
rinderpest.|40440002

Until the mid-1900s,|255562008
eradication efforts largely|19487008
took|419652001
place|257557008|421066005
on an individual country basis,|125676002|223369002|125676002|223369002|418836005|385435006|223369002|385435006|223369002|418836005
using|260676000
vaccination campaigns.

In 1950,
the Inter-African Bureau|11896004|413464008
of Epizootic Diseases|25746003
was
formed|35810008
,
with the stated goal|398070004|410518001
of eliminating rinderpest|40440002
from Africa.|223498002

During the 1960s,
a program
called
JP 15|223583001|2624008
attempted
to
vaccinate
all cattle
in participating countries|223369002
;
by 1979,
only
one|421379005
of the countries|223369002
involved|248448006
,
Sudan,|223518003
reported cases|229059009|398241000|229059009|413769002|223458004|398241000|223458004|413769002
of rinderpest.[18]|40440002

In 1969,
an outbreak|443684005
of the disease|64572001
originated
in Afghanistan,|223597009
travelling westwards|420008001
and
promoting
a mass vaccination plan,|300848003|52713000|300848003|397943006|118538004|52713000|118538004|397943006
which,
by 1972,
had
eliminated rinderpest|40440002
in all areas|42798000
of Asia|223500001
except for Lebanon|223612009
and
India|223600005
;
both
countries|223369002
were
the site|10546003
of further occurrences|46053002|272120004
of the disease|64572001
in the 1980s.[18]

During the 1980s,
however,
an outbreak|443684005
of rinderpest|40440002
from Sudan|223518003
spread|410677005
throughout Africa,|223498002
killing|248007002
millions
of cattle,
as well as
wildlife.

In response,
the Pan-African Rinderpest Campaign|389223000|413464008|40440002
was
initiated
in 1987,
using|260676000
vaccination
and
surveillance to|225419007
combat
the disease.|64572001

By the 1990s,
nearly
all
of Africa,|223498002
with the exception
of parts|260726005
of Sudan|223518003
and
Somalia,|223528007
were
declared
free|37837009
of rinderpest.[18]|40440002

Worldwide,
the Global Rinderpest Eradication Programme|60132005|40440002
was
initiated
in 1994,
supported|9096001|243114000
by the Food and Agriculture Organization,|255620007|21139007
the OIE,
and
the International Atomic Energy Agency.|290004009|248272003|224877003

This program
was
successful|385669000
in reducing rinderpest outbreaks|260400001|40440002|443684005
to few|57176003
and
far|46053002
between
by the late 1990s.|260383002

The program
is
estimated to|414135002
have
saved affected farmers 58 million net European Currency Units.[19]|247591002|106388008|414746007|255442003|414152003|15240007|247591002|106388008|414746007|255442003|15240007|248448006|106388008|414746007|255442003|414152003|15240007|248448006|106388008|414746007|255442003|15240007

The last confirmed case|59156000|398241000
of rinderpest|40440002
was
reported|229059009|223458004
in Kenya|223534000
in 2001.

Since then,
while
there
have
been
no confirmed cases,|59156000|398241000|59156000|413769002
the disease|64572001
is
believed to
have
been
present|52101004|246105001
in parts|260726005
of Somalia past|223528007
that date.|410671006

The final vaccinations|42796001
were
administered|418283001
in 2006,
and
the last surveillance operations|225419007|83578000
took|419652001
place|257557008|421066005
in 2009,
failing
to
find
any evidence|18669006
of the disease.[20]|64572001

In 2008,
scientists|308027003
involved|248448006
in rinderpest eradication efforts|40440002|19487008
believed
there
was
a good chance|20572008
that rinderpest|40440002
would
join
smallpox|67924001|243568000
as
officially "
wiped
off the face|89545001|302549007
of the planet".

The Food and Agriculture Organization,|255620007|21139007
which
had
been
co-ordinating
the global eradication program|60132005
for the disease,|64572001
announced
in November 2009
that
it
expected
the disease to|64572001
be
eradicated
within 18 months.[21]|258706009

In October 2010,
the FAO
announced
it
was
confident|225486005
the disease|64572001
has
been
eradicated.

The agency|224877003
said|66049007
that "[a]s
of mid 2010,|255562008
FAO
is
confident|225486005
that
the rinderpest virus|73376006
has
been
eliminated
from Europe,|223502009
Asia,|223500001
Middle East,|223605000
Arabian Peninsula,
and
Africa,|223498002
"
which
were
the locations|246267002
in which
the virus|49872002
had
been
last
reported.|229059009|223458004

Eradication
was
confirmed|59156000
by the World Organization for Animal Health|21139007|387961004|263775005
on 25 May 2011.[4]

On 28 June 2011,
FAO
and
its members countries officially|394852005|223369002
recognized
global freedom|60132005|37837009
from the deadly cattle virus.|49872002

On this day,|258703001|259032004
the FAO Conference,
the highest body|75540009|279495008|75540009|123037004|371879000|279495008|371879000|123037004
of the UN agency,|224877003
adopted|160496001
a resolution declaring
the eradication
of rinderpest.|40440002

The resolution also
called
on the world community|133928008
to follow up|308273005
by ensuring
that samples|123038009
of rinderpest viruses|73376006
and
vaccines|398827000
be
kept
under safe laboratory conditions|261904005|260905004
and
that rigorous standards|16046003|248457000
for disease surveillance|64572001|225419007
and
reporting|223458004
be
applied.|410618006

"
While
we
are
celebrating one|421379005
of the greatest successes|4757001|385669000
for FAO
and
its partners,|262043009
I wish to|42146005|22971001
remind|223452003
you
that
this extraordinary achievement
would
not
have
been
possible|371930009|60022001
without the joint efforts|39352004|19487008|81087007|19487008|302536002|19487008
and
strong commitments|260404005
of governments,
the main organizations|63161005|21139007
in Africa,|223498002
Asia|223500001
and
Europe,|223502009
and
without the continuous support|255238004|9096001|255238004|243114000
of donors
and
international institutions",|385437003
FAO Director-General Jacques Diouf|60132005
commented.[22]

The rinderpest eradication effort|40440002|19487008
is
estimated to|414135002
have
cost $5 billion.[23]|264657009

Stocks
of the rinderpest virus|73376006
are
still
maintained|385630006
by highly specialized laboratories.[20]|75540009|67995009|261904005|75540009|261904005

Rinderpest|40440002
was
one|421379005
of more|242762006
than a dozen agents|260872001
the United States|223688001
researched
as potential biological weapons|30207005
before terminating|58322009
its biological weapons
program.

Rinderpest|40440002
is
of concern
as a biological weapon
for the following reasons|255260001|410666004
:

Rinderpest|40440002
was
also
considered
as a biological weapon
in the United Kingdom's program|223860005
during World War II.[26]
