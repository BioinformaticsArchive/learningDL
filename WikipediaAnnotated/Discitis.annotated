*Discitis|2304001

*
or

*diskitis|2304001

is
an infection
in the intervertebral disc space|47886009
that
affects|4065008
different age groups,|263735002|424144002|261586004|263735002|424144002|160481000
but
usually spontaneously
affects|4065008
children|410601007|160499008
under 8 years|258707000
of age.|424144002

Nonetheless,
discitis|2304001
occurs|272120004
post surgically|288563008|83578000
in approximately 1-2 percent|26175008|118582008
of patients|116154003
after spinal surgery.|83578000

Symptoms
include|55919000
severe back pain,|76948002|123961009|76948002|255551008|76948002|281213008|76948002|302552004|76948002|77568009
leading|236874000
to
lack|41277001
of mobility.|363803005|246197003

Some very young children|260358002|84422007|410601007|260358002|84422007|160499008
may
refuse|58377000
to
walk|129006008
and
arching|9089003
of the back|123961009|255551008|281213008|302552004|77568009
is
possible.|371930009|60022001

In post-operative situations,|262061000
the symptoms
occur|272120004
within a week|258705008|259038000
and
result|394617004
in severe low back pain|24484000|279039007
or
neck pain|81680005
(
depending
on the surgical location|83578000|246267002
).

If
untreated|25265005
,
the discitis|2304001
may
resolve
on its own,
cause|23981006|134198009
a chronic low grade infection,|177010002
or
progress|385651009
to osteomyelitis|60168000
and
possibly even|60022001
an epidural abscess.|61974008

In case|398241000
of concomitant inflammation|79970003|257552002
of one|421379005
or
more vertebrae|242762006|420345000
(
in such cases usually|398241000|413769002
a the areas|42798000
adjacent|18769003
to the intervertebral disc spaces|47886009
)
[1]|260305007
the condition|260905004
is
called spondylodiscitis.|2304001

There
is
debate
as to the cause,|134198009
although
hematogenous seeding
of the offending organism|410653004
is
favored
as well as
direct|255589003
spread.|410677005

It
is
important to
differentiate|263933003
between spontaneous discitis|5054005|2304001
which
is
usually
from hematologic|57407000
spread|410677005
from a urinary
or
respiratory infection|275498002
versus
that
from a post-operative complication|385486001
which usually
involves|248448006
skin flora|119325001|39937001|181469002
such as staph aureus.|3092008

The cause|134198009
may
be
aseptic.[2]|261029002

Diagnosis|439401001
is
usually apparent
on MRI|113091000
although
plain X-rays|168537006
and
CT examinations|5880005
can
be
suggestive.|7196007

The MRI|113091000
will
reveal|263857004
air|417696007
changes|243326001|263703002
in the disc
and
possibly even external involvement|60022001|261074009|248448006
involving|248448006
the bone|272673000|3138006|90780006|128530007
or
epidural regions.|386352004|410673009

A biopsy|86273004
may
be
performed|398166005
and
helps
with diagnosis|439401001
in some cases|398241000|413769002
but
often|70232002
an organism|410653004
is
not
obtained.|398092000

C-reactive protein levels|55235003
and
ESR levels|258395000
will
be
elevated|75540009
and
are
useful
for treatment.|276239002|416118004

Often,|70232002
the white blood cell count|767002|365630000
will
be
normal|17621005|258744000
and
the patient|116154003
will
be
apyrexic.|86699002

Treatment usually|276239002|416118004
includes|55919000
antibiotics,|255631004
and
reducing|260400001
the mobility|363803005|246197003
of the affected region,|247591002|410673009|248448006|410673009
either
with a back brace|56144002
or
a plaster cast.|34164001

Without treatment,|276239002|416118004
the patient|116154003
may
form|246176004
an abscess|128477000
which
may
need|410525008|103325001
to
be
surgically|83578000
corrected.|370975003

Due to the poor vascularity|11403006|59820001|255351007|59820001
of the disc,
drugs|410942007
required
for treatment often|276239002|70232002|416118004|70232002
include|55919000
potent agents|30207005|260872001
such as Ciprofloxacin|392412000
along
with Vancomycin.|372735009

Occasionally,
oral drugs|260548002|410942007
can
be
used|394850002
to
treat|395077000
the infection
but
it
may
fail
and
IV drugs|410942007
may
be
required.

If
the patient|116154003
is
an adult many surgeons|133936004|304292004
and
doctors now|309343006
recommend
moving
little|281411007|255507004
and
often|70232002
and
within the pain|22253000
limits|255469002
of the medication.|410942007

Discs
respond
to osmotic pressure therefore movement|51272001|255324009
is
beneficial to
increase|260366006
their blood flow|58190003
and
fluid dynamics.|32457005|33463005|255765007

This
is
why disc patients|116154003
are
no longer told|255511005
to bed rest.|225316001|17535004

In children|410601007|160499008
whether
to bed rest|225316001|17535004
or
move|302000008|384598002|370125004
a little|281411007|255507004
is
decided
on an individual basis,|125676002|125676002|418836005|385435006|385435006|418836005
depending
on the site|10546003
and
severity|272141005
of the discitis.|2304001
