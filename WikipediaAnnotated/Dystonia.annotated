*Dystonia|15802004
*
*
is
a neurological movement disorder,|118940003|255324009|1199008|60342002
in which
sustained|263892007
muscle contractions|12140005
cause|23981006|134198009
twisting|51795009|129256008
and
repetitive movements|255324009
or
abnormal postures.|43029002

The disorder|64572001
may
be
hereditary|255404009
or
caused|23981006|134198009
by other factors|74964007
such as birth-related|3950001|272151006|3950001|262094002
or
other physical trauma,|74964007|5880005|74964007|5880005|74964007|19388002|74964007|19388002
infection,
poisoning|75478009
(
e.g.
,
lead poisoning|38342005
or
reaction|263851003
to pharmaceutical drugs,|80288002
particularly neuroleptics.|372482001

Treatment|276239002|416118004
is
difficult|52925006
and
has
been
limited|255469002
to minimizing
the symptoms
of the disorder,|64572001
since
there
is
no cure
available.|103328004

These
are
the most common dystonias|4757001|72906007
and
tend
to
be
classified|73504009
as
follows|367409002
:

The combination|89780004
of blepharospasmodic contractions|78558002
and
oromandibular dystonia|15802004
is
called cranial dystonia|443352005
or
Meige's syndrome.|230325003

Segmental dystonias|427945008
affect|4065008
two adjoining parts|420797005|260726005
of the body|279495008|123037004
:

There
is
a group|261586004|160481000|389109008
called
myoclonus dystonia|439732004
or
myoclonic dystonia,|439732004
where
some cases|398241000|413769002
are
hereditary|255404009
and
have
been
associated|47429007
with a missense mutation|55446002
in the dopamine-D2 receptor.|37484001

Some
of these cases|398241000|413769002
have
responded
remarkably
to alcohol.[7][8]|419442005|53041004|430837008

Symptoms
vary
according to the kind|261664005
of dystonia|15802004
involved.|248448006

In most cases,|398241000|413769002
dystonia|15802004
tends
to
lead|88488004
to abnormal posturing,|43029002
particularly
on movement.|255324009

Many sufferers|260396001
have
continuous pain,|255238004|22253000
cramping|55300003|410709000
and
relentless muscle spasms|45352006
due to involuntary muscle movements.|162227008|91727004|122447002|255324009

Other motor symptoms|74964007|267082004
are
possible|371930009|60022001
including|55919000
lip smacking.[9]|261114002|387341002|181221003|387341002

Early symptoms|264499004
may
include|55919000
loss
of precision muscle coordination|91727004|85352007
(sometimes first|255216001|232714002
manifested|250255003|249319006
in declining penmanship,
frequent small injuries|70232002|255507004
to the hands,|85562004
and
dropped items|426684005|404218003
)
,
cramping pain|279093005
with sustained use|263892007|277889008|263892007|419385000
and
trembling.|267079009

Significant muscle pain|386134007|68962001
and
cramping|55300003|410709000
may
result|394617004
from very minor exertions|260358002|410599005|19487008|260358002|255606000|19487008
like holding
a book|278212002
and
turning pages.|282987006

It
may
become
difficult to|52925006
find
a comfortable position|246449006
for arms|40983000
and
legs|30021000
with even
the minor exertions|410599005|19487008|255606000|19487008
associated|47429007
with holding arms|421139008|40983000
crossed|65145006
causing|23981006
significant pain similar to restless leg syndrome.|386134007|22253000|32914008

Affected persons|247591002|125676002|248448006|125676002
may
notice
trembling|267079009
in the diaphragm|263734003|336704008|181614006
while
breathing,|14910006|258162000
or
the need to|410525008|103325001
place|257557008|421066005
hands|85562004
in pockets,
under legs|30021000
while
sitting|33586001
or
under pillows|13855007
while
sleeping|258158006|248220008
to
keep
them still
and
to
reduce|260400001
pain.|22253000

Trembling|267079009
in the jaw|661005|181811001
may
be
felt|285854004
and
heard|47078008|118230007
while
lying|40199007|255576009
down,
and
the constant movement to|247911008
avoid
pain|22253000
may
result|394617004
in the grinding|15537006
and
wearing
down
of teeth,|38199008
or
symptoms
similar
to TMD.

The voice
may
crack
frequently|70232002
or
become harsh,|76412005
triggering|410658008
frequent throat clearing.|70232002|12239004

Swallowing|54731003|288937009
can
become
difficult|52925006
and
accompanied
by painful cramping.|279093005

Electrical sensors|18213006|408746007|258096005|408746007
(EMG|42803009
)
inserted|257867005
into affected muscle groups,|247591002|91727004|261586004|247591002|91727004|160481000|248448006|91727004|261586004|248448006|91727004|160481000
while
painful,|22253000
can
provide
a definitive diagnosis|261002007|439401001|261002007
by showing
pulsating|255356002
nerve signals|3057000|256864008
being
transmitted|60117003|258150004
to the muscles even|91727004
when
they
are
at rest.|258157001

The brain|12738006|258335003
appears
to
signal|38952000
portions|260726005
of fibers|400293002|37202001
within the affected muscle groups|247591002|91727004|261586004|247591002|91727004|160481000|248448006|91727004|261586004|248448006|91727004|160481000
at a firing speed|105496009|80032004|257195008
of about 10 Hz causing|259025008|23981006
them to
pulsate|255356002
,
tremble|267079009
and
contort.

When
called
upon to
perform|398166005
an intentional activity,|361269008|48761009|361269008|55561003|361269008|258745004|361269008|257733005
the muscles|91727004
fatigue|84229001
very quickly|260358002
and
some
portions|260726005
of the muscle groups|91727004|261586004|91727004|160481000
do
not
respond
(causing weakness|23981006|13791008|23981006|23981006|260407003
)
while
other portions|74964007|260726005
over-respond|21481007
or
become rigid|16046003|261026009
(
causing|23981006
micro-tears|19851009|40431001|19851009|122594008
under load
).

The symptoms
worsen|230993007|390772001
significantly
with use,|277889008|419385000
especially
in the case|398241000
of focal dystonia,|445006008
and
a "mirror effect"|47162009|253861007
is
often|70232002
observed
in other body parts|74964007|38866009
:
use|277889008|419385000
of the right hand|78791008|368455003
may
cause|23981006|134198009
pain|22253000
and
cramping|55300003|410709000
in
that hand|85562004|302539009
as well as
in the other hand|74964007|85562004|74964007|302539009
and
legs|30021000
that
were
not
being
used.|394850002

Stress,|262188008
anxiety,|48694002|197480006
lack|41277001
of sleep,|258158006
sustained use|263892007|277889008|263892007|419385000
and
cold temperatures|285686007
can
worsen|230993007|390772001
symptoms.

Direct symptoms|255589003
may
be
accompanied
by secondary effects|2603003|253861007|81170007|253861007
of the continuous muscle|255238004|91727004
and
brain activity,|263689005
including|55919000
disturbed sleep patterns,|26677001
exhaustion,|60119000
mood swings,|18963009
mental stress,
difficulty concentrating,|371157007
blurred vision,|246636008
digestive problems|106079008|55607006|86762007|55607006
and
short temper.|359530003|367450005

People|125676002
with dystonia|15802004
may
also
become
depressed|366979004
and
find
great difficulty adapting|255509001|371157007|263768009|371157007
their activities|257733005
and
livelihood
to a progressing disability.|255314001|21134002

Side effects
from treatment|276239002|416118004
and
medications|410942007
can
also present challenges|52101004|246105001
in normal activities.|17621005|257733005|258744000|257733005

In some cases,|398241000|413769002
symptoms
may
progress|385651009
and
then plateau
for years,|258707000
or
stop|422117008
progressing|255314001
entirely.

The progression|246453008|246450006
may
be
delayed
by treatment|276239002|416118004
or
adaptive lifestyle changes,|60134006|243326001|60134006|263703002
while
forced|263760002
continued use|255238004|277889008|255238004|419385000
may
make
symptoms
progress|385651009
more rapidly.|242762006|418694008

In others,|74964007
the symptoms
may
progress|385651009
to total disability,|258755000|21134002|255619001|21134002
making
some
of the more risky|242762006|30207005
forms|246176004
of treatment|276239002|416118004
worth considering.

In some cases|398241000|413769002
with patients|116154003
who already
have
dystonia,|15802004
a subsequent tramatic injury|255260001
or
the effects|253861007
of general anethesia|60132005
during an unrelated surgery|262241003|83578000
can
cause|23981006|134198009
the symptoms to
progress|385651009
rapidly.|418694008

An accurate diagnosis|263656005|439401001|263656005
may
be
difficult|52925006
because of the way
the disorder|64572001
manifests|250255003
itself.

Sufferers
may
be
diagnosed|439401001
as
having
similar
and
perhaps related disorders|272151006|64572001|262094002|64572001
including|55919000
Parkinson's disease,|49049000
essential tremor,|192839001
carpal tunnel syndrome,|246611002
TMD,
Tourette's syndrome,|5158005
or
other neuromuscular movement disorders.|74964007|255522009|255324009

It
has
been
found|404684003
that
the prevalence
of dystonia|15802004
is
high|75540009|371879000
in individuals|125676002|385435006
with Huntington?s disease,|58756001
where
the most common clinical presentations|4757001|72906007|58147004|246105001
are
internal shoulder rotation,|257913003|16982005|257913003|361103004
sustained fist clenching,|263892007|67651001
knee flexion,|304679005|9964006|49076000|9964006|361291001|9964006|72696002|9964006
and
foot inversion.|13130004

Risk factors|80943009
for increased dystonia|35105006|35105006|15802004|260366006|260366006|15802004
in patients|116154003
with Huntington?s disease|58756001
include|55919000
long disease duration|260384008|64572001
and
use|277889008|419385000
of antidopaminergic medication.[10]|410942007

The causes|134198009
of dystonia|15802004
are
not yet
known|36692007
or
understood|66216009
;
however,
they
are
categorized
as
follows|367409002
on a theoretical basis|418836005
:

_Primary dystonia_|63161005|63161005|15802004|261424001|261424001|15802004
is
suspected to|415684004
be
caused|23981006|134198009
by a pathology|394595002
of the central nervous system,|21483005|278199004
likely originating|2931005
in those parts|260726005
of the brain|12738006|258335003
concerned
with motor function,|52479005
such as the basal ganglia,|32610002
and
the GABA|259100002
(gamma-aminobutyric acid producing Purkinje neurons.|259100002|47220008

The precise cause|134198009
of primary dystonia|63161005|63161005|15802004|261424001|261424001|15802004
is
unknown.|261665006

In many cases|398241000|413769002
it
may
involve|248448006
some genetic predisposition|47708004
towards the disorder|64572001
combined|89780004
with environmental conditions.|276339004|260905004

_Secondary dystonia_ refers|2603003|439980006|2603003|15802004|439980006|81170007|439980006|81170007|15802004|439980006
to dystonia|15802004
brought|68369002
on
by some identified cause,|7882003|134198009
usually
involving|248448006
brain damage,|2470005
or
by some unidentified cause|69910005|134198009
such as chemical imbalance.|441900009

Some cases|398241000|413769002
of
(particularly focal|87017008
)
dystonia|15802004
are
brought|68369002
on
after
trauma,
are
induced|16404004
by certain drugs|17162000|410942007
(tardive dystonia,|49386006
or
may
be
the result|394617004
of diseases|64572001
of the nervous system|25087005|278196006
such as Wilson's disease.|190823004

Environmental|276339004
and
task-related factors|272151006|262094002
are
suspected|415684004
to
trigger|410658008
the development|278923009
of focal dystonias|445006008
because
they
appear
disproportionately
in individuals|125676002|385435006
who
perform|398166005
high precision hand movements|75540009|85562004|255324009|75540009|302539009|255324009|371879000|85562004|255324009|371879000|302539009|255324009
such as musicians,
engineers,|106269003
architects|308047006
and
artists.|159062006

Chlorpromazine|387258005
can
also
cause|23981006|134198009
dystonia,|15802004
which
can
be
often|70232002
misjudged
as a seizure.|91175000

Neuroleptic drugs often|372482001|70232002
cause|23981006|134198009
dystonia,|15802004
including|55919000
oculogyric crisis.|5332004

Treatment|276239002|416118004
has
been
limited|255469002
to minimizing
the symptoms
of the disorder|64572001
as
there
is
yet
no successful treatment|182985004
for its cause.|134198009

Reducing|260400001
the types|261664005
of movements|255324009
that trigger|410658008
or
worsen dystonic symptoms|230993007|390772001
provides
some relief,|224978009
as
does
reducing stress,|260400001|262188008
getting
plenty
of rest,|258157001
moderate exercise,|6736007|61686008

Various treatments focus|256220008|276239002|87017008|256220008|276239002|363702006
on sedating brain functions|17971005|12738006|246464006|17971005|258335003|246464006
or
blocking nerve communications|64874008|263536004

neuro-suppression|80633008|258761002
or
denervation.|286792001|66277009

All current treatments|15240007|276239002
have
negative side effects|260385009
and
risks.|30207005

In some cases,|398241000|413769002
botox|404909007
is
used.|394850002

While
research
in the area|42798000
of effectiveness|255403003
of physical therapy intervention|91251008|225334002
for dystonia|15802004
remains
weak,[11] there|13791008|260407003
is
reason|410666004
to
believe
that rehabilitation|52052004|394602003
will
benefit
patients|116154003
with dystonia.|15802004

Physical therapy|91251008
can
be
utilized
to
manage|119270007
changes|243326001|263703002
in balance,|249982003|78933003|282295000
mobility|363803005|246197003
and
overall
function|246464006
that
occur|272120004
as a result|394617004
of the disorder.|64572001

A variety
of treatment strategies|276239002|416118004
can
be
employed|224363007
to
address|397635003
the unique needs|410525008|103325001
of each individual.|125676002|385435006

Potential treatment interventions|30207005|276239002|225334002|30207005|416118004|225334002
include|55919000
splinting,|79321009
[14] therapeutic exercise,|229065009
manual|87982008
stretching|122546009
,
soft tissue|181607009
and
joint mobilization,|74251004|189834007
postural training|229069003
and
bracing,|360316004|415686002|272363005
[12] neuromuscular electrical stimulation,
constraint-induced movement therapy,|263856008|16404004|229064008
activity|48761009|55561003|258745004|257733005
and
environmental modification,|276339004|243326001
and
gait training.[13]|74914000

Recent research|6493001
has
investigated|116698004
further|46053002
into the role
of physiotherapy|91251008
in the treatment|276239002|416118004
of dystonia.|15802004

A recent study|6493001|110465008|6493001|224699009
showed
that reducing psychological stress,|260400001
in conjunction with exercise,|61686008
is
beneficial
for reducing truncal dystonia|260400001|22943007|260400001|22943007|15802004|260400001|262225004|260400001|262225004|15802004
in patients|116154003
with Parkinson?s Disease.|49049000

Another study emphasized progressive relaxation,|110465008|255314001|224699009|255314001
isometric muscle endurance,|91727004|406203001

coordination,|85352007
balance,|249982003|78933003|282295000
and
body perception,|279495008|81742003|123037004|81742003
seeing|281004000
significant improvements|386134007
to patients? quality|116154003|263496004
of life|224130005
after 4-weeks.[16]|260308009|258705008

Some focal dystonias|445006008
have
been
proven|277025001
treatable
through movement retraining|255324009
in the Taubman approach,
particularly
in the case|398241000
of musicians.

However other focal dystonias|445006008
may
not
respond
and
may
even
be
made
worse|230993007|390772001|231877006
by this treatment.|276239002|416118004

Due to the rare|84638005|103356009
and
variable nature|255372005|277302009
of dystonia,|15802004
research
investigating|116698004
the effectiveness|255403003
of these treatments|276239002
is
limited.|255469002

There
is
no gold standard|2309006|371256005
for physiotherapy rehabilitation.|91251008|52052004|91251008|394602003

To date,|410671006
focal cervical dystonia|445006008|261064006
has
received
the most research attention|4757001|6769007
;[13] however,
study designs|110465008|224699009
are
poorly|556001
controlled|31509003
and
limited|255469002
to small sample sizes.[11]|255507004|123038009|277049003

Different medications|263735002|410942007
are
tried
in an effort to|19487008
find
a combination|89780004
that
is
effective|255403003|254648000
for a specific person.|69658003|125676002

Not
all people|125676002
will
respond
well|20572008
to the same medications.|262126009|410942007

Medications|410942007
that
have
had
positive results|258758003|394617004|10828004|394617004
in some
include|55919000
:
diphenhydramine,|372682005
benzatropine,|372846002
anti-Parkinsons agents|255635008
(
such as trihexyphenidyl,|387120000
and
muscle relaxers|91727004
(
such as diazepam.|387264003

Medications|410942007
such as anticholinergics|373246003
(benztropine|372846002
)
,
which
act
as inhibitors|61511001
of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine,|35069000|57308006|35069000|104460004
may
provide
some relief.|224978009

In the case|398241000
of an acute dystonic reaction,|272118002|263851003
diphenhydramine|372682005
is
sometimes
used|394850002
(
though
this drug|410942007
is
well known|20572008|36692007
as an antihistamine,|372806008|373228009
in this context|263491009
it
is
being
used primarily|394850002
for its anticholinergic role|373246003
).

In the case|398241000
of Oculogyric crisis,|5332004
diphenhydramine|372682005
may
be
administered|418283001
with excellent results|425405005|394617004
with symptoms
subsiding
in a matter
of minutes._[citation|258701004|255507004|356624006

_]

Clonazepam,|387383007
an anti-seizure medicine,|91175000|410942007
is
also sometimes
prescribed.

However,
for most
their effects|253861007
are
limited|255469002
and
side effects
like mental confusion,|286933003
sedation,|72641008
mood swings|18963009
and
short-term memory loss|247592009
occur.|272120004

Botulinum toxin injections|404909007
into affected muscles|247591002|91727004|248448006|91727004
have
proved|277025001
quite successful|385669000
in providing
some relief|224978009
for
around 3?6 months,|260281002|258706009
depending
on the kind|261664005
of dystonia.|15802004

Botox injections|404909007|28289002|404909007|129326001
have
the advantage
of ready availability|103328004
(
the same form|262126009|246176004
is
used|394850002
for cosmetic surgery|56306000
)
and
the effects|253861007
are
not permanent.|6934004

There
is
a risk|30207005
of temporary paralysis|14803004|44695005
of the muscles|91727004
being
injected|422145002
or
the leaking|87952002
of the toxin|80917008
into adjacent muscle groups|18769003|91727004|261586004|18769003|91727004|160481000
causing|23981006
weakness|13791008|260407003
or
paralysis|44695005
in them.

The injections|28289002|129326001
have
to
be
repeated|27582007
as the effects|253861007
wear
off
and
around 15%
of recipients
will
develop
immunity|58915005
to the toxin.|80917008

There
is
a Type A|261664005
and
Type B toxin|261664005|80917008
approved|9571008
for treatment|276239002|416118004
of dystonia|15802004
;
often|70232002
those that
develop
resistance to Type A|30714006|261664005
may
be
able to|371150009
use|277889008|419385000
Type B.[17]|261664005

Dopamine agonists|418222008
:
One type|421379005|261664005
of dystonia,|15802004
dopamine-responsive dystonia,|412383006|80074009|412383006|80074009|15802004|32779004|80074009|32779004|80074009|15802004
can
be
completely
treated|28995006
with regular doses|17854005|277406006
of L-DOPA|387086006
in a form|246176004
such as Sinemet
(carbidopa/levodopa|404830004
).

Although
this
doesn't
remove|127485006
the condition,|260905004
it
does
alleviate
the symptoms
most
of the time.|410669006

(
In contrast,
dopamine antagonists|412383006|58516001|32779004|58516001
can
sometimes
cause|23981006|134198009
dystonia.|15802004

A baclofen pump|387342009|44668000
has
been
used|394850002
to
treat|395077000
patients|116154003
of all
ages|424144002|105436006|248280005
exhibiting muscle spasticity|397790002
along
with dystonia.|15802004

The pump|44668000
delivers
baclofen|387342009
via a catheter|19923001
to the thecal space
surrounding|355648006
the spinal cord.|2748008|180959008

The pump|44668000
itself
is
placed|257557008|421066005
in the abdomen.|277112006|52731004|302553009

It
can
be
refilled
periodically|81591007
by access|260507000
through the skin.[18]|119325001|39937001|181469002

Cannabidiol|96223000
has
been
found|404684003
to
be
effective|255403003|254648000
in reducing symptoms|260400001
of dystonia.|15802004

Surgery,|83578000
such as the denervation|286792001|66277009
of selected muscles,|91727004
may
also
provide
some relief|224978009
;
however,
the destruction|64597002
of nerves|3057000
in the limbs|66019005
or
brain|12738006|258335003
is
not reversible|35174006
and
should
only
be
considered
in the most extreme cases.|4757001|12565001|398241000|4757001|12565001|413769002

Recently,|6493001
the procedure|71388002
of deep brain stimulation (DBS)|230861003
has
proven successful|277025001|385669000
in a number|410680006|410681005
of cases|398241000|413769002
of severe generalised dystonia.|24484000|425492002

DBS
as treatment|276239002|416118004
for medication-refractory dystonia,|410942007|20646008|410942007|20646008|15802004
on the other hand,|74964007|85562004|74964007|302539009
may
increase|260366006
the risk|30207005
of suicide|44301001
in patients.|116154003

Unfortunately,
reference data
