*Mumps|240526004
*
*
(
*
*epidemic parotitis|240526004
*
*
)
is
a viral disease|34014006
of the human species,|278412004|69658003
caused|23981006|134198009
by the mumps virus.|50384007

Before the development|278923009
of vaccination
and
the introduction|107733003
of a vaccine,|398827000
it
was
a common childhood disease worldwide.|72906007|68433009|64572001

It
is
still
a significant threat|386134007
to health|263775005
in the third world,|70905002
and
outbreaks still|443684005
occur|272120004
sporadically
in developed countries.[1]|223369002

Painful swelling|22253000|423666004|22253000|442672001
of the salivary glands|75535001
(classically
the parotid gland|45289007|181234002
is
the most typical presentation.|4757001|246105001

Painful testicular swelling|22253000|87860000|22253000|438457000
(orchitis|274718005
and
rash|271807003
may
also
occur.|272120004

The symptoms
are
generally
not severe|24484000
in children.|410601007|160499008

In teenage males|22396007|248153007
and
men,|339947000
complications|116223007
such as infertility|8619003
or
subfertility|313279000
are
more common,|242762006|72906007
although
still rare|84638005|103356009
in absolute terms.|56136002

The disease|64572001
is
generally self-limiting,|255469002
running|418060005
its course|288524001
before receding,
with no specific treatment|69658003|276239002|69658003|416118004
apart from controlling|54776003|31509003
the symptoms
with pain medication.|22253000|410942007

The more common symptoms|242762006|72906007
of mumps|240526004
are
:

Other symptoms|74964007
of mumps|240526004
can
include|55919000
dry mouth,|56893005
sore face|247348008|89545001|247348008|302549007|279074008|89545001|279074008|302549007|410713007|89545001|410713007|302549007
and/or
ears|117590005|1910005
and
occasionally
in more serious cases,|242762006|42745003|398241000|242762006|42745003|413769002
loss
of voice.

In addition,|260364009
up to 20%
of persons|125676002
infected
with the mumps virus|50384007
do
not
show
symptoms,
so
it
is
possible to|371930009|60022001
be
infected
and
spread|410677005
the virus|49872002
without knowing|36692007
it.[9]

Fever|386661006
and
headache|25064002
are
prodromal symptoms
of mumps,|240526004
together with malaise|367391008
and
anorexia.

Mumps|240526004
is
a contagious disease|191415002
that
is
spread|410677005
from person|125676002
to person|125676002
through contact|11723008|70862002
with respiratory secretions,|423662002
such as saliva|256897009
from an infected person.|125676002

When
an infected person coughs|125676002|272039006|125676002|289114008
or
sneezes,|162367006
the droplets
aerosolize
and
can
enter|417985001
the eyes,|81745001
nose,|260540009|181195007
or
mouth|74262004|123851003|21082005|181220002
of another person.|125676002

Mumps|240526004
can
also
be
spread|410677005
by sharing food|255620007
and
drinks.|226465004

The virus|49872002
can
also
survive
on surfaces|410678000
and
then
be
spread|410677005
after contact|11723008|70862002
in a similar manner.

A person|125676002
infected
with mumps|240526004
is
contagious
from approximately 6 days|26175008|258703001
before the onset|77374008
of symptoms
until
about 9 days|258703001
after symptoms
start.|255395001

The incubation period|406646006
(time|410669006
until symptoms
begin|255395001
)
can
be
from 14?25 days,|258703001
but
is
more typically 16?18 days.[12]|242762006|258703001

A physical examination|5880005
confirms|59156000
the presence|386397008
of the swollen glands.|30746006

Usually,
the disease|64572001
is
diagnosed|439401001
on clinical grounds,|58147004
and
no confirmatory laboratory testing|269814003
is
needed.|410525008|103325001

If there
is
uncertainty|64957009
about the diagnosis,|439401001
a test|269814003|272393004
of saliva|256897009
or
blood|87612001|119273009
may
be
carried|288345009
out
;
a newer diagnostic confirmation,|441308009|74996004
using|260676000
real-time nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technology,|410669006|258066000
has
also
been
developed.

An estimated 20%-30%|414135002
of cases|398241000|413769002
are
asymptomatic.|84387000

As
with any inflammation|257552002
of the salivary glands,|75535001
serum amylase|89659001
is
often|70232002
elevated.[15][16]|75540009

The most common preventative measure|4757001|72906007|246445000|4757001|72906007|272391002
against mumps|240526004
is
a vaccination
with a mumps vaccine,|396431009
invented
by American microbiologist Maurice Hilleman|159138004
at Merck.

The vaccine|398827000
may
be
given|419582001
separately
or
as part|260726005
of the MMR immunization vaccine|396429000|127785005|396429000|38598009|398827000
which also
protects
against measles|14189004
and
rubella.|36653000

In the
US,
MMR
is
now
being
supplanted
by MMRV,
which
adds
protection
against chickenpox.|38907003

The
WHO
(World Health Organization|263775005|21139007
)
recommends
the use|277889008|419385000
of mumps vaccines|396431009
in all countries|223369002
with well-functioning childhood vaccination programmes.|20572008|246464006|68433009

In the United Kingdom|223860005
it
is
routinely
given|419582001
to children|410601007|160499008
at age 13 months|424144002|258706009
with a booster
at 3?5 years|260280001|258707000
(preschool|161116001
)
This
confers
lifelong immunity.|58915005

The American Academy of Pediatrics|394537008
recommends
the routine administration|50811001|413454004|50811001|416118004
of MMR vaccine|396429000
at ages 12?15 months|424144002|258706009
and
at 4?6 years.|260308009|258707000

In some locations,|246267002
the vaccine|398827000
is
given again|419582001
between 4|260308009
to 6 years|258707000
of age,|424144002
or
between 11
and
12 years|258707000
of age|424144002
if
not previously
given.|419582001

The efficacy
of the vaccine|398827000
depends
on the strain|48532005|276768000
of the vaccine,|398827000
but
is
usually
around 80%.

The Jeryl Lynn strain|48532005|276768000
is
most commonly|4757001
used|394850002
in developed countries|223369002
but
has
been
shown
to
have
reduced efficacy|260400001
in epidemic situations.

The Leningrad-Zagreb
strain|48532005|276768000
commonly
used|394850002
in developing countries|223369002
appears
to
have
superior efficacy|261183002
in epidemic situations.[21]

Because of the outbreaks|443684005
within college|224864007
and
university settings,|224871002
many governments
have
established vaccination|263748003|385645004
programs
to
prevent
large-scale outbreaks.|255509001|19892000|443684005|255509001|278111002|443684005

In Canada,|223686002
provincial governments
and
the Public Health Agency|310115006|224877003
of Canada|223686002
have
all
participated
in awareness campaigns to|312012004
encourage
students|65853000
ranging
from grade 1
to college|224864007
and
university to|224871002
get
vaccinated.[22]

Some anti-vaccine activists|398827000
protest
against the administration|413454004|416118004
of a vaccine|398827000
against mumps,|240526004
claiming
that
the attenuated vaccine strain|24588000|398827000|48532005|24588000|398827000|276768000
is
harmful,
and/or
that
the wild disease|262290003|64572001
is
beneficial.

There
is
no evidence whatsoever to|18669006
support|9096001|243114000
the claim
that
the wild disease|262290003|64572001
is
beneficial,
or
that
the MMR vaccine|396429000
is
harmful.

Claims
have
been
made
that
the MMR vaccine|396429000
is
linked
to autism|408856003
and
inflammatory bowel disease,|24526004
including|55919000
one study|421379005|110465008|421379005|224699009
by Andrew Wakefield[23][24]|264657009
(
the paper|50833004
was
discredited
and
retracted|37794007
in 2010
and
Wakefield
was
later
stripped|2677003|408097009
of his license
after his work|261041009
was
found|404684003
to
be
an "elaborate fraud" [25]|105563005
)
that
indicated|410535002
a link
between gastrointestinal disease,|119292006
autism,|408856003
and
the MMR vaccine.|396429000

However,
all further studies_[citation|46053002|110465008|46053002|224699009
needed|410525008|103325001
_]
since
that time|410669006
have
indicated|410535002
no link
between vaccination
with the MMR
and
autism.|408856003

Since
the dangers
of the disease|64572001
are
well known,|20572008|36692007
while
the dangers
of the vaccine|398827000
are
quite minimal,|255605001|255604002
most doctors|309343006
recommend
vaccination.

The
WHO,
the American Academy of Pediatrics,|394537008
the Advisory Committee
on Immunization|127785005
Practices
of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention,|26216008|64572001|31509003|169443000

the British Medical Association|74188005|263534001|74188005|272151006
and
the Royal Pharmaceutical Society|421967003
of Great Britain currently|223861009|15240007
recommend
routine vaccination|50811001
of children|410601007|160499008
against mumps.|240526004

The British Medical Association|74188005|263534001|74188005|272151006
and
Royal Pharmaceutical Society|421967003
of Great Britain|223861009
had
previously
recommended
against general mumps vaccination,|60132005|50583002
changing|243326001|263703002
that recommendation
in 1987.

In 1988
it
became
United Kingdom government policy to|223860005
introduce|127487003
mass child|300848003|410601007|300848003|160499008|118538004|410601007|118538004|160499008
mumps|240526004
vaccination
programmes
with the MMR vaccine,|396429000
and
MMR vaccine|396429000
is
now routinely
administered|418283001
in the UK._[citation

Before the introduction|107733003
of the mumps vaccine,|396431009
the mumps virus|50384007
was
the leading cause|236874000|134198009
of viral meningoencephalitis|7125002
in the United States.|223688001

However,
encephalitis|45170000
occurs|272120004
rarely|103356009
(less
than 2|260306008
per 100,000
).

In one|421379005
of the largest studies|255509001|110465008|255509001|224699009|263768009|110465008|263768009|224699009
in the literature,
the most common symptoms|4757001|72906007
of mumps meningoencephalitis|40099009
were
found|404684003
to
be
fever|386661006
(97%|260309001|264708004
)
,
vomiting|249497008
(94%
)
and
headache|25064002
(88.8%
).

The mumps vaccine|396431009
was
introduced|127487003
into the United States|223688001
in December 1967
:
since
its introduction there|107733003
has
been
a steady decrease|55011004|260400001|55011004|260370003
in the incidence
of mumps|240526004
and
mumps virus infection.|50384007|240526004|34014006

There
were
151,209 cases|398241000|413769002
of mumps|240526004
reported|229059009|223458004
in 1968.

Since 2001,
the case average|398241000
was
only 265|50607009|420295001
per year,|258707000|259039008
excluding|77765009
an outbreak|443684005
of
>6000 cases|398241000|413769002
in 2006
attributed|246061005
largely
to university contagion|224871002
in young adults.[28][29]|84422007|133936004

There
is
no specific treatment|69658003|276239002|69658003|416118004
for mumps.|240526004

Symptoms
may
be
relieved|398004007
by the application|410618006
of intermittent ice|7087005|896008
or
heat|88999006
to the affected neck/testicular area|247591002|45048000|42798000|247591002|302550007|42798000|248448006|45048000|42798000|248448006|302550007|42798000
and
by acetaminophen/paracetamol|387517004|387517004
(Tylenol|387517004
)
for pain relief.|182970005

Aspirin|387458008
is
not
used|394850002
due to a hypothetical link
with Reye's syndrome.|74351001

Warm salt water gargles,|46031004|70409003
soft foods,|228059003
and
extra fluids|32457005|33463005
may
also
help
relieve|397855004
symptoms.

According to the Department
of Health|263775005
of Minnesota there|224068009
is
no effective post-exposure recommendation to|255403003|288563008|24932003|254648000|288563008|24932003

of vaccine|398827000
or
immunoglobulin|112133008|42441008
is
not effective.[30]|255403003|254648000

Patients|116154003
are
advised|424900004
to
avoid
acidic foods|34957004|255620007
and
beverages,
since
these
stimulate
the salivary glands,|75535001
which
can
be
painful.[31]|22253000|264664006

Death|419620001|268923008
is
very unusual.|260358002

The disease|64572001
is
self-limiting,|255469002
and
general outcome|60132005|394617004
is
good, even|20572008
if
other organs|74964007|410653004
are
involved.|248448006

Known complications|36692007|116223007
of mumps|240526004
include|55919000
:

After the illness,|39104002
lifelong immunity|58915005
to mumps generally|240526004
occurs|272120004
;
reinfection|255230006
is
possible|371930009|60022001
but
tends
to
be
mild|255604002
