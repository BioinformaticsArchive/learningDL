*Aspergillosis|65553006
*
*
is
the name
given|419582001
to a wide variety|90522003
of diseases|64572001
caused|23981006|134198009
by infection
by fungi|414561005
of the genus _Aspergillus_.|18511007|2429008

The most common forms|4757001|72906007|246176004
are
allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis,|37981002
pulmonary aspergilloma,|39607008|10446001|264164005|10446001
and
invasive aspergillosis.|10179008|65553006

Most humans|278412004
inhale|421134003
_Aspergillus_ spores|2429008|263883009
every day.|69620002

Aspergillosis|65553006
develops
mainly
in individuals|125676002|385435006
who
are
immunocompromised|370391006
,
either
from disease|64572001
or
from immunosuppressive drugs,|372823004|410942007
and
is
a leading cause|236874000|134198009
of death|419620001|268923008
in acute leukemia|91855006
and
hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.|234336002

The most common cause|4757001|72906007|134198009
is
_Aspergillus fumigatus_.|32684000|411814001

A fungus ball|62720005
in the lungs|39607008
may
cause|23981006|134198009
no symptoms
and
may
be
discovered
only
with a chest X-ray,|399208008
or
it
may
cause|23981006|134198009
repeated coughing|27582007|272039006
up
of blood|87612001|119273009
and
occasionally severe, even fatal,|24484000|399166001
bleeding.|131148009

A rapidly invasive _Aspergillus_ infection|418694008|10179008|2429008
in the lungs often|39607008|70232002
causes|134198009
cough,|272039006
fever,|386661006
chest pain,|29857009
and
difficulty breathing.|267036007

Aspergillosis|65553006
affecting|247591002|248448006
the deeper tissues|131197000|85756007
makes
a person|125676002
very ill|260358002|367391008
.

Symptoms
include|55919000
fever,|386661006
chills,|43724002
shock,|27942005
delirium,|419567006
and
blood clots.|75753009

The person|125676002
may
develop
kidney failure,|42399005
liver failure|59927004
(causing jaundice,|23981006|18165001
and
breathing difficulties.|267036007

Death|419620001|268923008
can
occur|272120004
quickly.

Aspergillosis|65553006
of the ear canal|84301002
causes|134198009
itching|424492005
and
occasionally pain.|22253000

Fluid|32457005|33463005|255765007
draining|32712000
overnight|255270004
from the ear|117590005|1910005
may
leave|7771000|90737002
a stain|397165007|127790008
on the pillow.|13855007

Aspergillosis|65553006
of the sinuses|2095001
causes|134198009
a feeling|285854004
of congestion|85804007
and
sometimes pain|22253000
or
discharge.|307488001|58000006

In addition|260364009
to the symptoms,
an X-ray|52250000|168537006|363680008
or
computerised tomography (CT) scan|77477000
of the infected area|42798000
provides
clues
for making
the diagnosis.|439401001

Whenever
possible,|371930009|60022001
a doctor|309343006
sends
a sample|123038009
of infected material|260769002
to a laboratory to|261904005
confirm|59156000
identification|286672002|7882003
of the fungus.|414561005

On chest X-ray|399208008
and
CT,
pulmonary aspergillosis classically|6042001
manifests|250255003
as a halo sign,|29851005
and
,
later,
an air crescent sign.|417696007|264296008|72670004

In hematologic patients|116154003|57407000|116154003
with invasive aspergillosis,|10179008|65553006
the galactomannan test|269814003|272393004
can
make
the diagnosis|439401001
in a noninvasive way.|22762002

On microscopy,|117259009
_Aspergillus_ species|115994009
are
reliably
demonstrated
by silver stains,|117041003|406951002
e.g.
,
Gridley stain|397165007|127790008
or
Gomori methenamine-silver.|372773008|41967008|372773008|371257001|372773008|406951002

These
give|419582001
the fungal walls|414561005|224727009
a gray-black colour.|371253002|315240009|371253002|413464008|371253002|15086000|371253002|371252007|229029004|371252007|371253002|371252007

The hyphae|284688000
of Aspergillus species range|115994009
in diameter|81827009
from 2.5|264655001
to 4.5 ?m.|264676006

They
have
septate hyphae,|255584008|284688000
[3]|260313008
but
these
are
not always apparent,
and
in such cases|398241000|413769002
they
may
be
mistaken
for Zygomycota.|106554003

_Aspergillus_ hyphae|2429008|284688000
tend
to
have
dichotomous branching|77796000
that
is
progressive|255314001
and
primarily
at acute angles|272118002|1483009
of about 45?.[2]

Several experimental animal models|261028005|387961004
have
tested curcumin|272393004|89028002
(turmeric|227414003
on lung fibrosis|51615001
and
these studies|110465008|224699009
demonstrate
that curcumin attenuates|89028002|24588000
(lessens
)
lung injury|316358009
and
fibrosis|263756000
caused|23981006|134198009
by radiation,|30821001|82107009|108290001
chemotherapeutic drugs,|416608005|410942007|367336001|410942007
and
toxicants.

The growing amount|107651007
of data
from pharmacological|56183000
and
animal studies also|387961004|110465008|387961004|224699009
supports|9096001|243114000
the notion
that curcumin|89028002
plays|300776002
a protective role
in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease,|413846005
acute lung injury,|315345002
acute respiratory distress syndrome,|67782005
and
allergic asthma,|389145006
its therapeutic action|262202000|129264002
being
on the prevention|169443000
or
modulation
of inflammation|257552002
and
oxidative stress.|262188008

The current treatments|15240007|276239002
include|55919000
voriconazole|385469007
and
liposomal amphotericin B.|425953004

Newer findings|129721008
suggest
the use|277889008|419385000
of mild oral steroids|255604002|260548002|116566001
for a longer period|255511005|259037005
of time,|410669006
preferably
for 6-9 months|260273003|258706009
in aspergillosis|65553006
of the lungs.|39607008

Other drugs|74964007|410942007
used|394850002
,
such as amphotericin B,|77703004
caspofungin|413770001
(
in combination therapy only|229554006
)
,
flucytosine|387155003
(
in combination therapy only|229554006
)
,
or
itraconazole,|387532006
[4][5]|264676006
are
used|394850002
to
treat|395077000
this fungal infection.|3218000

However,
a growing proportion|8212001
of infections
are
resistant|30714006
to the triconazoles.[6]

Albeit
relatively rare|84638005|103356009
in humans,|278412004
aspergillosis|65553006
is
a common|72906007
and
dangerous infection
in birds,|387972009
particularly
in pet parrots.|107101001

Mallards|125102002
and
other ducks|74964007|396620009
are
particularly susceptible,|131196009
as
they
will
often|70232002
resort
to poor food sources|11403006|255620007|260753009|255351007|255620007|260753009
during bad weather.|556001

Captive raptors,
such as falcons|425187008
and
hawks,|40551000
are
susceptible|131196009
to this disease|64572001
if
they
are
kept
in poor conditions|11403006|260905004|255351007|260905004
and
especially
if
they
are
fed|238092004
pigeons,|107099008|422719004
which
are
often carriers|70232002|47461006
of "asper".

Aspergillosis|65553006
has
been
the culprit
in several recent rapid die-offs|261028005|6493001|255358001|419620001|261028005|6493001|255358001|399069006|261028005|6493001|255358001|419099009
among waterfowl.

From 8 December
until 14 December 2006,
over 2,000 Mallards|21481007|125102002
died|419620001|419099009
in the Burley,
Idaho area,|224057009|42798000
an agricultural community approximately 150 miles|133928008|26175008|258678002
southeast
of Boise.

Moldy|84489001
waste
grain|23182003|264331002
from the farmland
and
feedlots
in the area|42798000
is
the suspected source.|260753009|415684004|260753009

A similar aspergillosis outbreak|65553006|443684005
caused|23981006|134198009
by moldy grain|84489001|23182003|84489001|264331002
killed|248007002
500 Mallards|125102002
in Iowa|224060002
in 2005.

While
there
is
no connection|263538003
between aspergillosis|65553006
and
the H5N1 strain|55604004|48532005|55604004|276768000
of avian influenza|55604004
(commonly
called
"bird flu"|55604004
)
,
rapid die-offs|255358001|419620001|255358001|399069006|255358001|419099009
caused|23981006|134198009
by aspergillosis|65553006
can
spark
fears
of bird flu outbreaks.|55604004|443684005

Laboratory analysis|261904005|272389005
is
the only way to|50607009|420295001
distinguish
bird flu|55604004
from aspergillosis.|65553006
