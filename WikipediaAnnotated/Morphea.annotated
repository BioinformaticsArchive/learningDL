is
a medical term|74188005
for localized scleroderma.|201048007

The disease|64572001
involves|248448006
isolated patches|46651001|36875001
of hardened skin - there generally|19730000|119325001|19730000|39937001|19730000|181469002
is
no internal organ involvement.[2]|260521003|410653004|248448006

Morphea,|201048007|201049004
also
known|36692007
as localized scleroderma,|201048007
is
a thickening|263899003
and
hardening|19730000
of the skin|119325001|39937001|181469002
and
subcutaneous tissues|71966008
from excessive collagen deposition.|260378005|61472002|46595003

Morphea|201048007|201049004
includes|55919000
specific conditions|69658003|260905004
ranging
from very small plaques only|260358002|255507004|38551001
involving|248448006
the skin|119325001|39937001|181469002
to widespread disease causing functional|85333001|134198009|40143009|85333001|134198009|246464006
and
cosmetic deformities.|81024003|276654001|261513001|276654001

Morphea|201048007|201049004
discriminates|43147006
from systemic sclerosis|89155008
by its supposed lack|41277001
of internal organ involvement.|260521003|410653004|248448006

The most widely used classification|4757001|394850002|73504009
divides|422033008
morphea|201048007|201049004
into five general subtypes|421820001|60132005|260837004
:
plaque morphea,|128458002
generalized morphea,|7513007
linear scleroderma,|22784002
bullous morphea,|46077008|201048007|46077008|201049004
and
deep morphea.|131197000|201048007|131197000|201049004

This classification scheme|73504009
does
not
include|55919000
the mixed form|26242008|246176004
of morphea|201048007|201049004
in which different morphologies|263735002|116676008|263735002|72724002
of skin lesions|95324001
are
present|52101004|246105001
in the same individual.|262126009|125676002|262126009|385435006

Up to 15%
of morphea patients|201048007|116154003|201049004|116154003
may
fall|1912002
into this previously unrecognized category.[4]

Morphea|201048007|201049004
is
an uncommon condition|103356009|260905004
that
is
thought to|88952004
affect .02|4065008
to .04
in 100,000 people.|125676002

Adequate studies|51117008|110465008|51117008|224699009|88323005|110465008|88323005|224699009
on the incidence
and
prevalence
have
not
been
performed.|398166005

Morphea also|201048007|201049004
may
be
under-reported|261089000|229059009|261089000|223458004
,
as
physicians|309343006
may
be
unaware|418107008|406124004
of this disorder,|64572001
and
smaller morphea plaques|263796003|201048007|38551001|263796003|201049004|38551001|255507004|201048007|38551001|255507004|201049004|38551001
may
be
less often|276139006|70232002|263796003|70232002
referred|439980006
to a dermatologist|18803008
or
rheumatologist.|45440000

As
in many other connective tissue|74964007|181769001
or
autoimmune disorders,|85828009
morphea mainly|201048007|201049004
involves|248448006
women,|224526002
with a F:M ratio|372639009|118586006
of 3|260313008
:
1.[6]|260305007

Physicians|309343006
and
scientists|308027003
do
not
know|36692007
what
causes|134198009
morphea.|201048007|201049004

Case reports|398241000|229059009|398241000|223458004
and
observational studies|103705002|110465008|103705002|224699009
suggest
there
is
a higher frequency|27732004
of family history|57177007
of autoimmune diseases|85828009
in patients|116154003
with morphea.|201048007|201049004

Tests|269814003|272393004
for autoantibodies|30621004
associated|47429007
with morphea|201048007|201049004
have
shown
results|394617004
in higher frequencies|27732004
of anti-histone
and
anti-topoisomerase IIa antibodies.|68498002

Case reports|398241000|229059009|398241000|223458004
of morphea|201048007|201049004
co-existing
with other systemic autoimmune diseases|74964007|31099001|85828009
such as primary biliary cirrhosis,|31712002
vitiligo,|56727007
and
systemic lupus erythematosus lend support|55464009|9096001|55464009|243114000
to morphea|201048007|201049004
as an autoimmune disease.[8][9][10]|85828009

Throughout the years,|258707000
many different treatments|263735002|276239002
have
been
tried
for morphea|201048007|201049004
including|55919000
topical, intra-lesional,|272114000|359540000|272114000
and
systemic corticosteroids.|31099001|79440004

Antimalarials|373287002
such as hydroxychloroquine|373540008
or
chloroquine|373468005
have
been
used.|394850002

Other immunomodulators|74964007|427067006|74964007|372558009
such as methotrexate,|387381009
topical tacrolimus,|395431000
and
penicillamine|387235007
have
been
tried.

Ultraviolet A (UVA) light,|41355003
with
or
without psoralens|419047007
have
also
been
tried.

UVA-1,
a more specific wavelength|242762006|69658003|246522008
of UVA light,|56242006|371268001
is
able to|371150009
penetrate|53568006
the deeper portions|131197000|260726005
of the skin|119325001|39937001|181469002
and
thus,
thought|88952004
to
soften|35828005
the plaques|38551001
in morphea|201048007|201049004
by
acting
in two fashions|420797005
:

As
with all
of these treatments|276239002
for morphea,|201048007|201049004
the difficulty|371157007
in assessing outcomes|394617004
in an objective way|410518001|260224007
has
limited|255469002
the interpretation|280452008
of most studies|110465008|224699009
involving|248448006
these treatment modalities.|276239002|416118004
