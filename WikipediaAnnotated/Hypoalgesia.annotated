*
*Hypoalgesia|6810008
*
*
or
*
*hypalgesia|6810008
*
*
denotes
a decreased sensitivity|398026008
to painful stimuli.|22253000|8927009

Hypoalgesia|6810008
occurs|272120004
when
nociceptive
(painful|22253000
)
stimuli|8927009
are
interrupted|261017006
or
decreased somewhere|1250004|260400001|260371004
along the path
between the input
(nociceptors,
and
the places|257557008
where they
are
processed|415178003
and
recognized
as pain|22253000
in the conscious mind.

Hypoalgesic effects|6810008|253861007
can
be
mild,|255604002
such as massaging|387854002
a stubbed toe to|29707007|302547009
make
it
hurt less
or
taking aspirin to|419652001|387458008
decrease|260400001|260370003
a headache,|25064002
or
they
can
be
severe,|24484000
like
being
under strong anesthesia.|260404005|399097000|260404005|394577000|260404005|33653009

Hypoalgesia|6810008
can
be
caused|23981006|134198009
by exogenous chemicals|261074009|441900009|51352008|441900009
such as opioids,|404642006
as well as
by chemicals|441900009
produced
by the body|279495008|123037004
in phenomena
such as fear-|1402001
and
exercise- induced hypoalgesia.|61686008|16404004|6810008

Hypoalgesia|6810008
can
also
be
associated|47429007
with diseases,|64572001
such as CIPA|62985007
or
in less severe cases|276139006|24484000|398241000|276139006|24484000|413769002|263796003|24484000|398241000|263796003|24484000|413769002
with diabetes|73211009
or
other diseases|74964007|64572001
associated|47429007
with hypertension.|38341003

*
*Analgesics|373265006
*
*
are
a class|258391009
of biochemicals|80534008
that
cause|23981006|134198009
hypoalgesia.|6810008

Analgesics|373265006
can
act
on both
the peripheral|14414005
and
central nervous systems to|21483005
decrease|260400001|260370003
pain.|22253000

Certain analgesics also|17162000|373265006
work|261041009
to
decrease|260400001|260370003
the source|260753009
of the pain|22253000
by working to|261041009
decrease|260400001|260370003
swelling|423666004|442672001
and
inflammation,|257552002
as
in the case|398241000
of NSAIDs.[1]|372665008

*
*Opioids|404642006
*
* refers|439980006
to a specific group|69658003|261586004|69658003|160481000|69658003|389109008
of analgesics -|373265006
including|55919000
morphine,|373529000|442759006
codeine,|387494007|105142004
and
opium -|21919007
that
act
on opioid receptors,|404642006|116647005
which
are
located
mainly
in the central nervous system.|21483005|278199004

Endogenous opioids|73979006|404642006
are
types|261664005
of opioids|404642006
produced
by the body specifically to|279495008|123037004
modulate|261019009
pain.|22253000

They
include|55919000
endorphins,|53682000
enkephalins,|61299002
dynorphins|26277008
and
endomorphins.

These peptides|52642002
are
especially important
for modulating pain|261019009|22253000
in response
to the environment.|276339004

These
can
be
released|68776005|129299003
in response
to a number|410680006|410681005
of things,
including|55919000
increased blood pressure,|38341003|24184005
pain|22253000
and
danger.

It
has
been
found|404684003
that endogenous opioids|73979006|404642006
are
at least partially responsible|276139006|394851003|263796003|394851003
for phenomena
like ?Runner's
high?,|75540009|371879000
hypoalgesia|6810008
in the fight-|248005005
or-
flight response,
and
even
for the analgesic effects|373265006|253861007
of acupuncture therapy.|44868003

In all
these cases,|398241000|413769002
there
is
a certain level|17162000|258395000|17162000|276625007
of signal
processing|415178003
that
occurs|272120004
in the CNS
which
leads|88488004|236874000
to the release|58000006|68776005|258760001|129299003|115956009
of these chemicals.|441900009

There
has
been
a great deal|255509001|263768009
of research
examining|64049009
the link
between exercise|61686008
and
hypoalgesia.|6810008

Many studies|260396001|110465008|260396001|224699009
have
shown
the direct link|255589003
between the two|420797005
by subjecting patients to|116154003
exercise|61686008
and
rating
their pain responses,|248240001
but
despite the great deal|255509001|263768009
of research,
the mechanism|257544000
of action|129264002
is
still poorly|556001
understood.|66216009

It
has
been
shown
that
the triggering mechanism|257544000|410658008|257544000
for the hypoalgesic effects|6810008|253861007
is
the increase|260366006
in blood pressure|75367002|392570002|386536003
that
accompanies
a good workout.|20572008|73438004

The body|279495008|123037004
senses|106148006
the increased blood pressure,|38341003|24184005
and
it
is
hypothesized
that
in response,
endogenous opioids|73979006|404642006
are
released.|68776005|129299003

This hypothesis
is
well|20572008
supported|9096001|243114000
in human research,|278412004
and
it
has
been
verified
that
it
plays|300776002
a part,|260726005
but
animal research|387961004
implies
that other mechanisms|74964007|257544000
are
also
involved.[4]|248448006

*
*Fear induced hypoalgesia|16404004|6810008|1402001|16404004|6810008
*
*
is
another example
of a mechanism|257544000
controlled|31509003
by opioids.|404642006

It
is
postulated
that fear|1402001
is
a defense mechanism|224992003
that
has
evolved|59381007
over time to|410669006
provide
protection.

In the case|398241000
of hypoalgesia,|6810008
a decreased response|1250004|260400001|260371004
to pain|22253000
would
be
very beneficial|260358002
in a situation
where an organism?s life|410653004|224130005
was
at stake,
since
feeling pain|285854004|22253000|22253000
would
be
a hindrance
rather than
a help.

It
has
been
well documented|20572008|397934002
that fear|1402001
does
cause|23981006|134198009
a decrease|260400001|260370003
in pain response,|248240001
[5] however much|264706000|264605009
like the exercise induced hypoalgesia,|61686008|16404004|6810008
the exact mechanisms|257544000
of action|129264002
are
not well understood.|20572008|66216009

Studies|110465008|224699009
have
shown
that opioids|404642006
are
definitely
involved|248448006
in the process,|415178003
yet
opiates|5602001|360204007
alone|105529008
do
not completely
explain
the analgesic response.|373265006

What
the other mechanisms|74964007|257544000
of action|129264002
are
is
still unknown.|261665006

It
has
been
demonstrated
that
many diseases|64572001
can
cause|23981006|134198009
hypoalgesia.|6810008

Some diseases,|64572001
like CIPA,|62985007
are
hereditary disorders|32895009
where genes|67271001
essential|34325006
for the correct functioning|246464006
of nociceptors
no longer work.|255511005|261041009

There
are
many diseases|260396001|64572001
like this,
and
they all
fall|1912002
under the category
of hereditary sensory autonomic neuropathies.|128205005

Alternatively,
some diseases|64572001
affect|4065008
other functions|74964007|246464006
in your body,|279495008|123037004
which
can
activate
the pathways
that
cause|23981006|134198009
hypoalgesia.|6810008

This effect happens|253861007
in people|125676002
with diabetes|73211009
and
other diseases|74964007|64572001
associated|47429007
with hypertension.|38341003

Hereditary sensory and autonomic neuropathies (HSAN),|128205005
e.g.|258795003

CIPA,|62985007
are
hereditary disorders|32895009
that
are
characterized
by malfunctioning|76797004|386585008
or
nonfunctioning pain receptors.|22253000|116647005

Most
of these diseases|64572001
are
also
associated|47429007
with decreased temperature sensation|398026008|105723007|398026008|246508008|1250004|397638001|260400001|397638001|260371004|397638001
as well.|20572008

In some cases|398241000|413769002
these diseases|64572001
are
also
associated|47429007
with other symptoms|74964007
like mental retardation|91138005
and
diminished production|1250004
of sweat|74616000|161857006
and
tears.|40431001|122594008

Diseases|64572001
like this
can
be
very dangerous|260358002
for the patients,|116154003
because
they
are
not able to|371150009
judge|11205001
what
hurts
,
and
therefore
when
they
should
stop|422117008
doing
something.

A child|410601007|160499008
with the disease|64572001
might
bite|3404009|25272006
their finger|7569003|302541005
clean|228402009
off before|236874000|421718005
they
realized
that
what they
were
doing
might
harm
them,
or
they
might
leave|7771000|90737002
their hand|85562004|302539009
on a hot stove|264018002|91656009
without ever realizing
it
was
on.|420771004|420862001

Diseases|64572001
like this
show
just
how
beneficial feeling pain|285854004|22253000|22253000
is
for our survival.

Many studies|260396001|110465008|260396001|224699009
have
shown
that hypertension|38341003
in patients|116154003
can
cause|23981006|134198009
hypoalgesia.|6810008

Diseases|64572001
like diabetes,|73211009
which
are
associated|47429007
with hypertension|38341003
are
also
associated|47429007
with hypoalgesia.|6810008

Just
like
in Exercise-Induced Hypoalgesia,|61686008|16404004|6810008
the increased blood pressure|38341003|24184005
of hypertension|38341003
works|261041009
as a signal
to the body to|279495008|123037004
release|58000006|68776005|258760001|129299003|115956009
opioids|404642006
and
activate
other pain modulation pathways.|74964007|22253000

Also,
although
the area|42798000
is
not widely
studied|110465008|224699009
,
there
is
evidence|18669006
that
this
is
not
the only|50607009|420295001
cause.|23981006|134198009

Diseases|64572001
may
lead|88488004
to activation
of any
of these mechanisms,|257544000
just
like diabetes causing hypertension.|73211009|23981006|38341003

A full study|261015003|110465008|261015003|224699009
of the pathways
regulating
pain|22253000
is
needed.|410525008|103325001
