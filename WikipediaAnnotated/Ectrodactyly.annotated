involves|248448006
the deficiency|260372006|248325000
or
absence|2667000|418560003
of one|421379005
or
more central digits|242762006|26216008|82680008
of the hand|85562004|302539009
or
foot|56459004|259051005|302545001
and
is
also
known|36692007
as split hand/split foot malformation (SHFM).|205358006|85562004|276654001|205358006|302539009|276654001|299033004|56459004|299033004|259051005|299033004|302545001|34111000|56459004|34111000|259051005|34111000|302545001|85562004|302297009|302539009|302297009

The hands|85562004
and
feet|56459004|259051005
of people|125676002
with ectrodactyly|81208006
are
often|70232002
described
as "claw-|58575009
like"
and
may
include|55919000
only
the thumb|76505004|302540006
and
one finger|421379005|7569003|421379005|302541005
(usually
either
the little finger,|12406000
ring finger,|82002001
or
a syndactyly|373413006
of the two|420797005
)
with similar abnormalities|276654001
of the feet.[2]|56459004|259051005

A large number|255509001|410680006|255509001|410681005
of human gene defects|82256003|6920004
can
cause|23981006|134198009
ectrodactyly.|81208006

The most common mode|4757001|72906007
of inheritance|246071007
is
autosomal dominant|263681008
with reduced penetrance,|260400001|53568006
while
autosomal recessive|258211005
and
X-linked forms|263934009|246176004
occur|272120004
more rarely.|242762006|103356009

Ectrodactyly|81208006
can
also
be
caused|23981006|134198009
by deletions,
translocations,|15897004
and
inversions|60844005|45027002
in chromosome 7|70488008
(7q
).

The deletions
in 7q
can
result|394617004
in a contiguous gene syndrome|65424008|67271001
that
includes|55919000
growth impairment,|40226000
microcephaly,|1829003
craniofacial manifestations,|250255003|251190009
hernias,|414403008
hearing loss,|343087000|15188001
and
mental retardation.|91138005

Translocations|15897004
in 7q
do
not
have
as many abnormalities|276654001
but
are
generally
associated|47429007
with most hearing loss cases.|398241000|413769002|343087000|398241000|343087000|413769002|15188001|398241000|15188001|413769002

This
is
why
most cases|398241000|413769002
of ectrodactyly|81208006
are
generally
accompanied
by another abnormality|276654001
or
linked
to another syndrome
(ex.

EEC,
LMS,
ECP
).

Detailed studies|110465008|224699009
of a number|410680006|410681005
of mouse|447612001|447482001
models
for ectrodactyly|81208006
have
also
revealed|263857004
that
a failure to|76797004
maintain|385630006
median apical ectodermal ridge (AER) signalling|399488007|43674008|63206006|26833005|38952000|260528009|43674008|63206006|26833005|38952000
can
be
the main pathogenic mechanism|63161005|264418008|257544000
in triggering|410658008
this abnormality.|276654001

A number|410680006|410681005
of factors
make
the identification|286672002|7882003
of the genetic defects|276654001
underlying|255546002
human ectrodactyly|278412004|81208006
a complicated process|255302009|415178003
:
the limited number|255469002|410680006|255469002|410681005
of families|35359004
linked
to each split hand/foot malformation (SHFM) locus,|205358006|85562004|276654001|205358006|302539009|276654001|299033004|56459004|299033004|259051005|299033004|302545001|34111000|56459004|34111000|259051005|34111000|302545001|85562004|302297009|302539009|302297009
the large number|255509001|410680006|255509001|410681005
of morphogens
involved|248448006
in limb development,|66019005|278923009|243996003|278923009
the complex interactions|103360007
between these morphogens,
the involvement|248448006
of modifier genes,|67271001
and
the presumed involvement|248448006
of multiple gene|260396001|67271001
or
long-range regulatory elements|255511005|86457007
in some cases|398241000|413769002
of ectrodactyly.|81208006

In the clinical setting|58147004
these genetic characteristics|3950001|255395001
can
become
problematic
and
making predictions
of carrier status|246098006
and
severity|272141005
of the disease impossible to|64572001
predict.[6]

In 2011,
a novel mutation|7147002|55446002
in DLX5
was
found|404684003
to
be
involved|248448006
in SHFM.[7]

As
mentioned
in the Genetics
section|62083003|118630004
,
ectrodactyly|81208006
can
be
caused|23981006|134198009
by various changes|256220008|243326001|256220008|263703002
to 7q.

When
7q
is
altered
by a deletion
or
a translocation ectrodactyly|15897004|81208006
can
sometimes
be
associated|47429007
with hearing loss.|343087000|15188001

the only|50607009|420295001
form|246176004
of split hand/ malformation|299033004|34111000
associated|47429007
with sensorineural hearing loss.[4]|60700002

The functional utility|40143009|225927009|246464006|225927009
of the malformed limbs|276654001|66019005
is

In 2006,

Ectrodactyly|81208006
is
not only
a genetic characteristic|3950001|255395001
in humans,|278412004
but
can
also
occur|272120004
in frogs|47843009

toads,|84903005

The following examples|255260001
are
studies|110465008|224699009
showing
the natural occurrence|510009|272120004
of ectrodactyly|81208006
in animals,|387961004
without the disease|64572001
being

In all three examples|421291004
we
see|281004000
how rare|84638005|103356009
the actual occurrence|272120004
of ectrodactyly|81208006
is.

The Department
of Biological Sciences|12893009
at the University of Alberta|224871002|224013005
in Edmonton,
Alberta|224013005
performed|398166005
a study to|110465008|224699009
estimate|414135002
deformity levels|276654001|258395000|127560004|258395000|417893002|258395000
in Wood Frogs|82878000
in areas|42798000
of relatively low disturbance.|62482003|371880002

After
roughly 22,733 individuals|125676002|385435006
were
examined|64049009
during field studies,|255798002|110465008|255798002|224699009
it
was
found|404684003
that only 49 Wood Frogs|50607009|82878000|420295001|82878000
had
the ectrodactyly deformity.[12]|81208006|276654001|81208006|127560004|81208006|417893002

In a study|110465008|224699009
performed|398166005
by the Department
of Forestry
and
Natural Resources|510009
at Purdue University,|224871002
approximately 2000 salamanders|26175008|23873006
(687 adults|133936004
and
1259 larvae
)
were
captured
from a large wetland complex|255509001|103360007
and
evaluated
for malformations.|276654001

Among the 687 adults,|133936004
54
(7.9%
)
were
malformed.

Of these 54 adults,|133936004
46
(85%
)
had
missing
(ectrodactyly|81208006
)
,
extra
(polyphalangy
)
or
dwarfed digits|237837007|82680008
(brachydactyly|43476002
).

Among the 1259 larvae,
102
were
malformed
,
with 94
(92%
)
of the malformations|276654001
involving|248448006
ectrodactyly,|81208006
polyphalangy,
and
brachydactyly.|43476002

Results|394617004
showed
few differences|57176003|263735002
in the frequency|260864003|272123002
of malformations|276654001
among life-history changes,|161712005|161712005|392521001
suggesting
that malformed larvae|276654001
do
not
suffer
substantially higher mortality|75540009|409651001|371879000|409651001
than their adult conspecifics.[14]|133936004

In a ?_Journal

to

the ectrodactyly abnormality,|81208006|276654001
[16]
illustrating
this rare|84638005|103356009
and
unique disease.|64572001

According to M.P.|258311008

Ferreira,
a case|398241000
of ectrodactyly|81208006
was
found|404684003
in a two month old male|420797005|258706009|70753007|248153007|420797005|259036001|70753007|248153007

In another study,|110465008|224699009
Carrig
and
co-workers also|106541005
reported|229059009|223458004
a series|13039001
of 14 dogs[18]|448771007
with this abnormality|276654001
proving|277025001
that
although
ectrodactyly|81208006
is
an uncommon occurrence|103356009|272120004
for dogs,|448771007
it
is
not entirely unheard of.
