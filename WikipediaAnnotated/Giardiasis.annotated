*Giardiasis|58265007
*
* ? popularly
known|36692007
as
*
*beaver fever|392585008|386661006
*
* ?
is
a disease|64572001
caused|23981006|134198009
by the flagellate protozoan _Giardia lamblia_|62300007|78181009
(also sometimes
called
_Giardia intestinalis_|78181009
and
_Giardia duodenalis_|78181009
).

The giardia organism|61419001|410653004|58265007|410653004
inhabits
the digestive tract|122865005
of a wide variety|90522003
of domestic|261770009
and
wild animal species,|262290003|387961004|69658003
as well as
humans.|278412004

It
is
a common cause|72906007|134198009
of gastroenteritis|25374005
in humans,|278412004
infecting
approximately 200 million people worldwide.|26175008|125676002

Symptoms
include|55919000
loss
of appetite,|33911006
diarrhea,|398032003
hematuria|53298000
(blood|87612001|119273009
in urine|78014005
)
,
loose|78799005
or
watery stool,|398032003|398212009
stomach cramps,|51197009
upset stomach,|162059005
projectile vomiting|8579004
(uncommon|103356009
)
,
bloating|248490000
,
flatulence,|308698004
and
burping|275299008
(often sulphurous|70232002|43735007
).

Symptoms typically
begin|255395001
one|421379005
to two weeks|420797005|258705008
after infection
and
may
wane
and
reappear
cyclically.

Symptoms
are
caused|23981006|134198009
by _Giardia_ organisms|61419001|410653004|58265007|410653004
coating|228224007
the
inside of the small intestine|264196002|181250005
and
blocking nutrient absorption.|2899008|226355009|112232007|226355009

Most people|125676002
are
asymptomatic|84387000
;
only
about a third|70905002
of infected people|125676002
exhibit
symptoms.

Untreated|25265005
,
symptoms
may
last
for six weeks|422218008|258705008
or
longer.|255511005

Symptomatic infections|264931009
are
well|20572008
recognised
as causing lactose intolerance,|23981006|267425008
[2]|260306008
which,
while
usually temporary,|14803004
may
become
permanent.|6934004

Although
hydrogen breath tests|252233000
indicate|410535002
poorer rates|11403006|255351007
of carbohydrate absorption|2331003
in those asymptomatically
infected
,
such tests|269814003|272393004
are
not diagnostic|439401001|261004008
of infection.

It
has
been
suggested
that
these observations|103705002
are
explained
by symptomatic giardia infection allowing|264931009|61419001|264931009|58265007
for the overgrowth
of other bacteria.[6][5]|74964007|409822003

Some studies|110465008|224699009
have
shown
giardiasis|58265007
should
be
considered
as a cause|134198009
of vitamin B12 Deficiency|190634004
as a result|394617004
of the problems|55607006
caused|23981006|134198009
within the intestinal absorption system.|38597004|246333005

[7]

Giardiasis|58265007
is
passed
via the fecal-oral route.|39477002|26643006

Primary routes|63161005|261424001
are
personal contact|11723008|70862002
and
contaminated consumables.|62604006

The more susceptible|242762006|131196009
are
institutional|257622000|385437003
or
day-care workers,|258703001|106541005|259032004|106541005
travelers,
those eating improperly treated food|48263008|28995006|255620007
or
drink,|226465004
and
people|125676002
who
have
contact|11723008|70862002
with individuals already|125676002|385435006
infected.

It
is
a particular danger
to people|125676002
hiking
or
backpacking
in wilderness areas worldwide,|42798000
especially
if
they
have
no immediate access|88694003|260507000|49499008|260507000
to medical supplies.|74188005|425398004

_Giardia_|61419001|58265007
is
also
suspected|415684004
to
be
zoonotic?communicable
between humans|278412004
and
other animals.|74964007|387961004

Major reservoir hosts|255603008|257687008
include|55919000
beavers,|392585008
dogs,|448771007
cats,|448169003|388618001
horses,|35354009
humans,|278412004
cattle
and
birds.|387972009

Although
the mechanisms|257544000
by which _Giardia_|61419001|58265007
causes|134198009
injury
have
not
been
fully
elucidated
yet,
the research
points
to a multifaceted attack.|3988004|217315002|3988004|216299002

Those putative attack sites|217315002|10546003|216299002|10546003
include|55919000
endothelial brush border damage,|27168002|17599007|37782003
enterotoxin production,|116554007
immunological reaction,|37523008|263851003
and
alternation
of gut motility.|122865005|122865005|398598008

The attachment|1431002
of trophozoites,|103551003
of which _Giardia lamblia_|78181009
is
one,|421379005
causes|134198009
loss
of brush border surface area,|17599007|410678000|42798000
villus flattening,
and
inhibition|61511001|419495008
of dissachardidase activities.|257733005

Ultimately,
the enteric microbiota|225770002
of the intestine overgrow|261093006
and
may
be
the cause|134198009
of further symptoms.|46053002

This idea|363878000
has
not
been
fully
investigated.|116698004

The alteration
of the brush border|17599007
and
villi
leads|88488004|236874000
to an inability
for nutrient|226355009
and
water absorption|11713004|119318008
from the intestine.|261093006

This results|394617004
in diarrhea,|398032003
one|421379005
of the predominant symptoms.

In the case|398241000
of asymptomatic giardiasis,|84387000|58265007
there
can
be
malabsorption|32230006
with
or
without histological changes|67151002|243326001|67151002|263703002
to the small intestine.|264196002|181250005

The degree|258395000|246173007
to which malabsorption|32230006
occurs|272120004
in symptomatic|264931009
and
asymptomatic cases|84387000|398241000|84387000|413769002
is
highly|75540009
varied.

Interestingly,
the species _Giardia intestinalis_|69658003|78181009
has
proteinases|130202003|116536008
that
attack|217315002|216299002
the villi
of the brush border|17599007
and
appear
to
increase|260366006
crypt cell proliferation|76197007
and
crypt length.|410668003

Crypt cells|4421005
existing
on the sides|182353008
of the villi.

On an immunological level,|37523008|258395000|37523008|276625007
activated host T-lymphocytes|57184004
attack|217315002|216299002
endothelial cells|45709008
that
have
been
injured
in order to
remove|127485006
the cell.|4421005|362837007

This
occurs|272120004
after the disruption|76555007
of the tight junctions|24206002
between endothelial cells|45709008
that make up|255532002|353734004
the brush border.|17599007

The result|394617004
is
heavily
increased|35105006|260366006
intestinal permeability.|261093006|82540007

There
appears
to
be
a further increase|46053002|260366006
in apoptosis|20663007
by _Giardia intestinalis_|78181009
which further damages|46053002|37782003
the intestinal barrier|261093006
to permeability.|82540007

There
is
siginificant up-regulation|255532002|353734004
of the apoptotic cascade|20663007
by the parasite.|37763007

Furthermore,
substantial down regulation|49764008
of the anti-apoptotic proteins Bcl-2|20663007|88878007
and
upregulation
of the proapoptotic protein Bax.|88878007

These connections|263538003
suggest
a role
of caspase-dependent apoptosis|371154000|20663007
in the pathogenesis|303109001
of giardiasis.|58265007

_Giardia_|61419001|58265007
protects
its own growth
by reducing|260400001
the formation|11798007|255277001
of nitric oxide|409378005
by consuming
all local arginine|255470001|52625008
which
is
the necessary substrate
for the production
of nitric oxide.|409378005

Arginine starvation|52625008|212968006
is
known to|36692007
be
a cause|134198009
of programmed cell death|20663007
and
local removal|255470001|118292001|255470001|128303001
is
a strong apoptotic agent.|260404005|20663007|260872001

[8]

Drugs|410942007
used|394850002
to
treat|395077000
adults|133936004
include|55919000
metronidazole,|372602008
albendazole|387558006
and
quinacrine.|350225009

Furazolidone|416556006
and
nitazoxanide|407148001
may
be
used|394850002
in children.|410601007|160499008

Treatment|276239002|416118004
is
not always necessary,
as
the body|279495008|123037004
can
defeat
the infection
by itself.

The drug tinidazole|410942007|395907001
can
treat|395077000
giardiasis|58265007
in a single treatment|125681006|276239002|125681006|416118004|50607009|276239002|50607009|416118004
of 2000 mg,|427264006
instead of the longer treatment|255511005|276239002|255511005|416118004
of the other medications|74964007|410942007
listed.

The shorter duration|260402009
of treatment|276239002|416118004
may
also
cause|23981006|134198009
patient less|116154003
distress.|69328002

Tinidazole|395907001
is
now
approved|9571008
by the FDA[11]
and
available|103328004
to US patients.|116154003
