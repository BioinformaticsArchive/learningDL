*Toxoplasmosis|187192000
*
*
is
a parasitic disease|17322007
caused|23981006|134198009
by the protozoan _Toxoplasma gondii_.|417396000|4649006

The parasite|37763007
infects
most genera|18511007
of warm-blooded animals,
including|55919000
humans,|278412004
but
the primary host|63161005|261424001
is
the felid|388618001|388623001
(cat|448169003|33384004|388626009
)
family.|35359004

Animals|387961004
are
infected
by eating infected meat,|48263008|28647000
by ingestion|111984006
of feces|39477002
of a cat|448169003|33384004|388626009
that
has
itself recently|6493001
been
infected
,
or
by transmission|258150004
from mother|72705000
to fetus.|83418008

Cats|448169003|388618001
are
the primary source|63161005|260753009|261424001|260753009
of infection
to human hosts,|278412004
although
contact|11723008|70862002
with raw meat,|6304003|28647000
especially pork,|226934003
is
a more significant source|371925005|260753009
of human infections|278412004
in some countries.|223369002

Fecal contamination|39477002
of hands|85562004
is
a significant risk factor.[2]|386134007|80943009

Up to a third|70905002
of the world's human population|278412004|385436007|278412004|389109008
is
estimated to|414135002
carry|288345009
a _Toxoplasma_ infection.|61949005

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|26216008|64572001|31509003|169443000
notes
that overall seroprevalence
in the United States|223688001
as
determined
with specimens|123038009
collected
by the National Health|263775005
and
Nutritional Examination Survey|5880005
(NHANES
between 1999
and
2004
was
found|404684003
to
be
10.8%,
with seroprevalence
among women|224526002
of childbearing age|424144002
(15
to 44 years|258707000
)
11%.

Another
study|110465008|224699009
placed seroprevalence|257557008|421066005
in the U.S.|223688001

at 22.5%.

The same study|262126009|110465008|262126009|224699009
claimed
a seroprevalence
of 75%
in El Savador.[4]

During the first few weeks|255216001|258705008|232714002|258705008
post-exposure,|288563008|71677004|288563008|24932003
the infection typically
causes|134198009
a mild flu-like illness|255604002|95891005
or
no illness.|39104002

Thereafter,
the parasite rarely|37763007|103356009
causes|134198009
any symptoms
in otherwise healthy adults.|102512003

However,
those
with a weakened immune system,|116003000
such as AIDS patients|62479008|116154003
or
pregnant women,|255409004
may
become
seriously ill,|367391008
and
it
can
occasionally
be
fatal.|399166001

The parasite|37763007
can
cause|23981006|134198009
encephalitis|45170000
(inflammation|257552002
of the brain|12738006|258335003
)
and
neurologic diseases,|118940003
and
can
affect|4065008
the heart,|80891009|302509004
liver,|10200004|181268008
inner ears,|302462009
and
eyes|81745001
(chorioretinitis.|46627006

Recent research|6493001
has
also linked toxoplasmosis|187192000
with brain cancer,|428061005
Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder,|406506008
Obsessive Compulsive Disorder,|191736004
and
Schizophrenia.[6][7]|58214004

Infection
has
two stages|420797005|261612004
:

During acute toxoplasmosis,|272118002|187192000
symptoms
are
often influenza-like|70232002|6142004|70232002|396425006
:
swollen lymph nodes,|30746006
or
muscle aches|68962001
and
pains|22253000
that last
for a month|258706009|259036001
or
more.|242762006

Rarely,|103356009
a patient|116154003
with a fully
functioning|246464006
immune system|116003000
may
develop
eye damage|81745001|37782003|244486005|37782003
from toxoplasmosis.|187192000

Young children|84422007|410601007|84422007|160499008
and
immunocompromised patients,|370391006
such as those with HIV/AIDS,|20401003|19030005|62479008|20401003|86406008|62479008|20401003|402916007|62479008|421463005|19030005|62479008|421463005|86406008|62479008|421463005|402916007|62479008
those taking certain types|419652001|17162000|261664005|419652001|255544004|261664005
of chemotherapy,|416608005|367336001
or
those who
have
recently|6493001
received
an organ transplant,|410653004|263903005|410653004|24486003
may
develop
severe toxoplasmosis.|24484000|187192000

This
can
cause|23981006|134198009
damage|37782003
to the brain|12738006|258335003
(encephalitis|45170000
or
the eyes|81745001
(necrotizing retinochoroiditis.|255310005|46627006

Infants|418119000
infected
via placental transmission|62669004|258150004|388033005|258150004
may
be
born|106970005|81827009|398209006
with either
of these problems,|55607006
or
with nasal malformations,|260540009|276654001|276654001
although
these complications|116223007
are
rare|84638005|103356009
in newborns.|133933007

Swollen lymph nodes|30746006
are
commonly
found|404684003
in the neck|45048000|302550007
or
under the chin,|30291003|362632004
followed|367409002
by the axillae|422543003
(armpits|422543003
)
and
the groin.|255575008

Swelling|423666004|442672001
may
occur|272120004
at different times|263735002|410669006|263735002|417929005
after the initial infection,|884001|232714002
persist
,
and/or
recur|246455001
for various times|256220008|410669006|256220008|417929005
independently of antiparasitic treatment.|333032003|276239002|333032003|416118004

It
is
usually
found|404684003
at single sites|125681006|10546003|50607009|10546003
in adults,|133936004
but
in children multiple sites|410601007|260396001|10546003|160499008|260396001|10546003
may
be
more common.|242762006|72906007

Enlarged lymph nodes|30746006
will
resolve
within one|421379005
to two months|420797005|258706009
in 60%
of patients.|116154003

However,
a quarter
of patients|116154003
take|419652001
2?4 months to|260306008|258706009
return|7528007
to normal|17621005|258744000
and
8%
take|419652001
4?6 months.|260308009|258706009

A substantial number|410680006|410681005
of patients|116154003
(6%
)
do
not
return|7528007
to normal|17621005|258744000
until much later.[9]|260383002

It
is
easy|36203004
for a host to
become
infected
with _Toxoplasma gondii_|4649006
and
develop
toxoplasmosis|187192000
without knowing|36692007
it.

In most immunocompetent patients,|35194002|116154003
the infection
enters|417985001
a latent phase,|44104002|21191007
during which only bradyzoites|50607009|420295001
are
present,|52101004|246105001
forming|35810008
cysts|441457006
in nervous
and
muscle tissue.|91727004

Most infants|418119000
who
are
infected
while
in the womb|35039007|181452004
have
no symptoms
at birth|3950001
but
may
develop
symptoms later in life.[10]|260383002|224130005

While
rare, skin lesions|84638005|95324001|103356009|95324001
may
occur|272120004
in the acquired form|255396000|246176004
of the disease,|64572001
including|55919000
roseola|54385001
and
erythema multiforme-|36715001
like eruptions,|1806006
prurigo-|64144002
like nodules,|27925004|279365004
urticaria,|126485001
and
maculopapular lesions.|247471006

Newborns|133933007
may
have
punctate macules,|7800008|112629002
ecchymoses,|302227002
or ?blueberry muffin? lesions.|412061001|226704004

Diagnosis|439401001
of cutaneous toxoplasmosis|240666009
is
based|418836005
on the tachyzoite form|260230007|246176004
of _T.

gondii_
being
found|404684003
in the epidermis.|55988001

It
is
found|404684003
in all levels|258395000
of the epidermis,|55988001
is
about 6 ?m
by 2 ?m ,|260306008
bow-shaped,|107644003|300842002
the nucleus|84640000
being
one-third|421379005|70905002
of its size.|277049003

It
can
be
identified|7882003
by electron microscopy|73512001
or
by Giemsa staining tissue|104208006|85756007
where the cytoplasm
shows
blue,|405738005
the nucleus red.[11]|84640000|386713009|84640000|371240000

Studies|110465008|224699009
have
been
conducted|844005
that
show
the toxoplasmosis parasite|187192000|37763007
may
affect|4065008
behavior|844005
and
may
present|52101004|246105001
as
or
be
a causative
or
contributory factor
in various psychiatric disorders|256220008|74732009
such as depression,|35489007|366979004|255339005
anxiety|48694002|197480006
and
schizophrenia.|58214004

In 11
of 19 scientific studies,|110465008|224699009
_T.

gondii_ antibody levels|68498002|258395000|112133008|258395000
were
found|404684003
to
be
significantly higher|75540009|371879000
in individuals|125676002|385435006
affected|247591002|248448006
by first-incidence schizophrenia|255216001|58214004|232714002|58214004
than
in unaffected persons.|125676002

Individuals|125676002|385435006
with schizophrenia|58214004
are
also more likely to|2931005
report|229059009|223458004
a clinical history|58147004|58147004|392521001
of toxoplasmosis|187192000
than those
in the general population.|60132005|385436007|60132005|389109008

Recent work|6493001|261041009
at the University of Leeds|224871002
has
found|404684003
that
the parasite|37763007
produces
an enzyme|90668006
with tyrosine hydroxylase|30603002
and
phenylalanine hydroxylase activity.|9923001|48761009|9923001|55561003|9923001|258745004|9923001|257733005

This enzyme|90668006
may
contribute
to the behavioral changes|315244000
observed
in toxoplasmosis|187192000
by altering
the production
of dopamine,|412383006|32779004
a neurotransmitter|35069000
involved|248448006
in mood,|85256008
sociability,|225597007
attention,|6769007
motivation|106121005
and
sleep patterns.|401175000

Schizophrenia|58214004
has
long|255511005
been
linked
to dopamine dysregulation.|412383006|32779004

Minocycline,|372653009
an antibiotic|255631004
that
is
capable
of passing
the blood-brain barrier|20245001
and
used|394850002
for treating toxoplasmosis|28995006|187192000
has
been
found|404684003
to
alleviate
the symptoms
of schizophrenia.[17]|58214004

Toxoplasmosis|187192000
can
be
difficult to|52925006
distinguish
from primary central nervous system lymphoma,|307649006
and
as a result,|394617004
the diagnosis|439401001
is
made
by a trial|110465008
of therapy|276239002
(pyrimethamine,|373769001
sulfadiazine + leucovorin|74523009|396065004
)
,
followed|367409002
by a brain biopsy|12738006|86273004|258335003|86273004
if
the drugs|410942007
produce
no effect clinically|253861007
and
no improvement
on repeat|27582007
imaging.|363679005|278395004

Detection
of _Toxoplasma gondii_|4649006
in human blood samples|278412004|119297000
may
also
be
achieved
by
using|260676000
the polymerase chain reaction (PCR).|258066000

Inactive cysts|73425007|441457006
may
exist
in a host
which
would
evade
detection.

Toxoplasmosis|187192000
cannot
be
detected|260373001
with immunostaining.

Lymph nodes|59441001
affected|247591002|248448006
by toxoplasma|61949005
have
characteristic changes,|243326001|263703002
including|55919000
poorly demarcated reactive germinal centers,|556001|11214006|16733004
clusters
of monocytoid B cells|35907002
and
scattered epithelioid histiocytes.|255393008|14295007

Transmission|258150004
may
occur|272120004
through
:

Cats|448169003|388618001
excrete|418678001
the pathogen|264418008
in their feces|39477002
for a number|410680006|410681005
of weeks|258705008
after contracting|78558002
the disease,|64572001
generally
by eating|48263008
an infected rodent.|388077003

Even then,
cat faeces|448169003|39477002|33384004|39477002|388626009|39477002
are
not generally contagious
for the first day|255216001|258703001|255216001|259032004|232714002|258703001|232714002|259032004
or
two|420797005
after excretion,|63911002
after
which the cyst 'ripens'|441457006|103552005
and
becomes
potentially pathogenic.[21]|264418008

Congenital toxoplasmosis|73893000
is
a special form|67995009|246176004
in which
an unborn child|410601007|160499008
is
infected
via the placenta.|62669004|181455002

A positive antibody titer|258758003|250507002|258758003|365589000|10828004|250507002|10828004|365589000
indicates|410535002
previous exposure|9130008|71677004|9130008|24932003
and
immunity|58915005
and
largely
ensures
the unborn baby's safety.|418119000

A simple blood|13673007|87612001|13673007|119273009
draw
at the first pre-natal doctor visit|255216001|236874000|223731005|309343006|255216001|272113006|223731005|309343006|232714002|236874000|223731005|309343006|232714002|272113006|223731005|309343006
can
determine
whether
or
not
the woman|224526002
has
had
previous exposure|9130008|71677004|9130008|24932003
and
therefore
whether
or
not
she
is
at risk.|410519009

If
a woman|224526002
receives
her first exposure|255216001|71677004|255216001|24932003|232714002|71677004|232714002|24932003
to toxoplasmosis|187192000
while
pregnant,|77386006|127362006
the baby|418119000
is
at particular risk.|30207005

A woman|224526002
with no previous exposure|9130008|71677004|9130008|24932003

to cat feces,|448169003|39477002|33384004|39477002|388626009|39477002
and
gardening
(cat feces|448169003|39477002|33384004|39477002|388626009|39477002
are
common|72906007
in garden soil|415555003
).

Most cats|448169003|388618001
are
not actively shedding oocysts|103541004
and
so|223528007
are
not
a danger,
but
the risk|30207005
may
be
reduced|260400001
further|46053002
by
having
the litterbox
emptied|69251000
daily|69620002
(oocysts|103541004
require
longer|255511005
than a single day to|125681006|258703001|125681006|259032004|50607009|258703001|50607009|259032004
become
infective
)
,
and
by
having
someone
else
empty
the litterbox.

However,
while
risks|30207005
can
be
minimized
,
they
cannot
be
eliminated.

For pregnant women|255409004
with negative antibody titer,|260385009|250507002|260385009|365589000
indicating|410535002
no previous exposure|9130008|71677004|9130008|24932003
to _T.

gondii_,
as
frequent|70232002
as
monthly serology testing|89185003|68793005|89185003|68793005|272393004
is
advisable
as treatment|276239002|416118004
during pregnancy|289908002
for those women|224526002
exposed|24932003
to _T.

gondii_
for the first time|255216001|410669006|232714002|410669006
decreases|260370003
dramatically
the risk|30207005
of passing
the parasite|37763007
to the fetus.|83418008

Despite these risks,|30207005
pregnant women|255409004
are
not routinely
screened|20135006|360156006
for toxoplasmosis|187192000
in most countries|223369002
(Portugal,|223675004
[22] France,|223666001
[23] Austria,|264657009|223635007
[23] Uruguay,|264657009|223723000
[24]
and
Italy[25]|223668000
being
the exceptions
)
for reasons|410666004
of cost-effectiveness|255403003
and
the high number|75540009|410680006|75540009|410681005|371879000|410680006|371879000|410681005
of false positives|90213003
generated.

As invasive prenatal testing|10179008|10179008|272393004
incurs
some risk|30207005
to the fetus|83418008
(18.5 pregnancy losses|289908002
per toxoplasmosis case|187192000|398241000
prevented|116699007
)
,
[23] postnatal|264657009|263844007
or
neonatal screening|60151004
is
preferred.|225773000

The exceptions
are
cases|398241000|413769002
where fetal abnormalities|276654001
are
noted
,
and
thus screening|20135006
can
be
targeted.[23]|264657009

Some regional screening programmes|410673009|20135006|255470001|20135006
operate
in Germany,|223637004
Switzerland|223642007
and
Belgium.[25]|223660007

Treatment|276239002|416118004
is
very important|260358002
for recently|6493001
infected
pregnant women,|255409004
to
prevent
infection
of the fetus.|83418008

Since
a baby's immune system|418119000|116003000
does
not
develop
fully
for the first year|255216001|258707000|255216001|259039008|232714002|258707000|232714002|259039008
of life,|224130005
and
the resilient cysts|441457006
that
form|246176004
throughout the body|279495008|123037004
are
very difficult to|260358002|52925006
eradicate
with anti-protozoans,|417396000
an infection
can
be
very serious|260358002|42745003
in the young.|84422007

Treatment|276239002|416118004
is
often only|70232002
recommended
for people|125676002
with serious health problems,|42745003|263775005|55607006
such as HIV|19030005|86406008|402916007
with CD4 count|258734002
under 200,
because
the disease|64572001
is
most serious|4757001|42745003
when
one's immune system|421379005|116003000
is
weak.|13791008|260407003

Trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole|398731002
is
the drug|410942007
of choice to
prevent
Toxoplasma,|61949005
but
is
not
the drug to|410942007
treat.|395077000

Medications|410942007
that
are
prescribed
for acute toxoplasmosis|272118002|187192000
are
:

(Other antibiotics|74964007|255631004
such as minocycline|372653009
have
seen
some use|277889008|419385000
as a salvage therapy.|257950002|276239002

In people|125676002
with latent toxoplasmosis,|44104002|187192000
the cysts|441457006
are
immune|255386009
to these treatments,|276239002
as
the antibiotics|255631004
do
not
reach|282679008
the bradyzoites
in sufficient concentration.|51117008|82742001

Medications|410942007
that
are
prescribed
for latent toxoplasmosis|44104002|187192000
are
:

The parasite|37763007
itself
can
cause|23981006|134198009
various effects|256220008|253861007
on the host body,|279495008|123037004
some
of which
are
not fully
understood.|66216009

It
has
been
found|404684003
that
the parasite|37763007
has
the ability to|371150009
change|243326001|263703002
the behaviour|844005
of its host
:
infected rats|371565004|371564000
and
mice|447612001|447482001
are
less fearful|276139006|276139006|279119006|263796003|263796003|279119006
of cats?|448169003|388618001
in fact,
some
of the infected rats|371565004|371564000
seek
out areas|255529000|42798000
marked|46998006
with cat urine.|448169003|78014005|33384004|78014005|388626009|78014005

This effect|253861007
is
advantageous
to the parasite,|37763007
which
is
able to|371150009
proliferate
if
a cat|448169003|33384004|388626009
eats|48263008
the infected rat|371565004|371564000
and
thereby
becomes
a carrier.|47461006|29679002

The mechanism|257544000
for this change|243326001|263703002
is
not completely
understood|66216009
,
but
there
is
evidence|18669006
that toxoplasmosis infection|187192000
raises|260399008
dopamine levels|412383006|258395000|32779004|258395000
and
concentrates
in the amygdala|4958002
in infected mice.[29]|447612001|447482001

The findings|404684003
of behavioural alteration|844005
in rats|371565004|371564000
and
mice|447612001|447482001
have
led|88488004|236874000
some scientists to|308027003
speculate
that _Toxoplasma_|61949005
may
have
similar effects|253861007
in humans.|278412004

_Toxoplasma_|61949005
is
one|421379005
of a number|410680006|410681005
of parasites|37763007
that
may
alter
their host's behaviour|844005
as a part|260726005
of their life cycle.|224130005|44180009

Some
studies|110465008|224699009
have
linked latent toxoplasmosis|44104002|187192000
to an increased incidence|35105006|260366006
of traffic accidents.[31]|264664006

The evidence|18669006
for behavioral effects|844005|253861007
on humans|278412004
is
controversial.

No prospective research
has
been
done
on the topic,|359540000
e.g.
,
testing|272393004
people|125676002
before
and
after infection to
ensure
that
the proposed behavior|844005
arises|68727004
only afterwards.|50607009|420295001

Although
some researchers
have
found|404684003
potentially important associations|263534001
with _Toxoplasma_,|61949005
the causal relationship,|134198009|272151006
if
any,
is
unknown|261665006
,
i.e.,|42146005|22971001
it
is
possible|371930009|60022001
that
these associations merely|263534001
reflect|225436004
factors
that
predispose
certain types|17162000|261664005
of people|125676002
to infection.

However,
many
of the neurobehavioral symptoms
that
are
postulated
to
be
due to toxoplasmosis|187192000
correlate
to the general function|60132005|246464006
of dopamine|412383006|32779004
in the human brain,|278412004|12738006|278412004|258335003
and
the fact
that toxoplasma|61949005
encodes
the dopamine synthesizing enzyme tyrosine hydroxylase|412383006|90668006|30603002|32779004|90668006|30603002
makes
it likely|2931005
that neurobehavioral symptoms
can
result|394617004
from infection.[33]|264667004

These types|261664005
of studies|110465008|224699009
are
suggestive|7196007
but
cannot
confirm|59156000
a causal relationship|134198009|272151006
(
because of the possibility,
for example,
that schizophrenia|58214004
increases|260366006
the likelihood|2931005
of _Toxoplasma_ infection|61949005
rather than
the other way|74964007
around
).[34]

The U.S.|223688001

NHANES
(1999?2004
)
national probability sample|2931005|123038009
found|404684003
that 10.8%
of U.S.|223688001

persons 6?49 years|125676002|258707000
of age,|424144002
and
11.0%
of women 15?44 years|224526002|258707000
of age,|424144002
had
_Toxoplasma_-specific IgG antibodies,|415738004|69658003|61949005|404263002
indicating|410535002
that
they
were
infected
with the organism.|410653004

This prevalence
has
significantly
decreased|1250004|260400001|260371004
from the NHANES III|257471003
(1988?1994
).[35][36]

Two risk factors|420797005|80943009
for contracting toxoplasmosis|78558002|187192000
are
:

A University of California,|224871002|224043007|224871002|25997004
Davis
study|110465008|224699009
of dead sea otters|419620001|45253004
collected
from 1998
to 2004
found|404684003
that toxoplasmosis|187192000
was
the cause|134198009
of death|419620001|268923008
for 13%
of the animals.|387961004

Proximity
to freshwater|5024000
outflows
into the ocean|223501002
was
a major risk factor.|255603008|80943009

Ingestion|111984006
of oocysts|103541004
from cat faeces|448169003|39477002|33384004|39477002|388626009|39477002
is
considered to
be
the most likely ultimate source.|4757001|2931005|260753009

Runoff
containing|42504009
wild cat faeces|33384004|39477002
and
litter|370553007
from domestic cats|448169003
flushed|271811009
down toilets|360008003
are
possible sources|371930009|260753009|60022001|260753009
of oocysts.|103541004

According to an article
in _New Scientist_[40]|7147002|308027003|259031006
the parasites|37763007
have
been
found|404684003
in dolphins|33612001
and
whales.|106981008|20689007

Researchers
Black|315240009|413464008|15086000|371252007
and
Massie
believe
that anchovies,|49740007
which
travel|420008001
from estuaries
into the open ocean,|56116003|223501002
may
be
helping
to
spread|410677005
the disease.|64572001

The protozoan|417396000
was
first|255216001|232714002
discovered
by Nicolle & Manceaux,
who
in 1908
isolated|46651001
it
from the African rodent _Ctenodactylus gundi_,|413464008|388077003
then
in 1909
differentiated|263933003
the disease|64572001
from _Leishmania_|79357004
and
named|27468005
it _Toxoplasma gondii_.|4649006

The first|255216001|232714002
recorded congenital case|6160004|398241000|255399007|398241000
was
not
until 1923,
and
the first adult case|255216001|133936004|398241000|232714002|133936004|398241000
not
until 1940.

In 1948,
a serological dye test|68793005|61789006|27377004|258021009
was
created
by Sabin & Feldman,
which
is
now
the standard basis|418836005
for diagnostic tests.[41]|103693007
