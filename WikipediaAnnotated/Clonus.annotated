*Clonus|36649002
*
*
(
from the Greek|1451003
for "violent,
confused|286933003
motion"|56219004
)
is
a series|13039001
of involuntary,
rhythmic,|272121000
muscular contractions|12140005
and
relaxations.

Clonus|36649002
is
a sign|72670004
of certain neurological conditions,|17162000|1199008|260905004
particularly
associated|47429007
with upper motor neuron lesions|299738004
involving|248448006
descending motor pathways,|75294000
and
in many cases|398241000|413769002
is
,
accompanied
by spasticity|397790002
(
another
form|246176004
of hyperexcitability.

Unlike small, spontaneous twitches|255507004|5054005|60238002
known|36692007
as fasciculations|82470000
(usually
caused|23981006|134198009
by lower motor neuron pathology|91770004|394595002
)
,
clonus|36649002
causes|134198009
large motions|255509001|56219004|255509001|272149007
that
are
usually
initiated
by a reflex.|87572000|106146005

Studies|110465008|224699009
have
shown
clonus beat frequency|36649002|260864003|36649002|272123002
to range
from 3-8 Hertz (Hz)|260313008|259025008
on average,
and
may
last
a few seconds|57176003|257997001
to several minutes|261028005|258701004|261028005|255507004|261028005|356624006
depending
on the patient?s condition.[1]|116154003|260905004

Clonus|36649002
is
typically
seen
in patients|116154003
with stroke,|230690007
multiple sclerosis,|24700007
spinal cord damage|2748008|37782003|180959008|37782003
and
hepatic encephalopathy.|13920009

Clonus|36649002
has
also
appeared
after ingesting potent serotonergic drugs,|111984006|30207005|410942007
where ingestion strongly|111984006
predicts
imminent serotonin toxicity
(serotonin syndrome.|35868009|371089000

Self re-excitation|228877007
of hyperactive stretch reflexes|44548000|63177006
:
_[1]|260305007

The
self re-excitation|228877007
of hyperactive stretch reflexes theory|44548000|63177006
involves|248448006
a repetitive contract- relax cycle|15166001|44180009
in the affected muscle,|247591002|91727004|248448006|91727004
which
creates
oscillatory movements|255324009
in the affected limb.|247591002|66019005|247591002|243996003|248448006|66019005|248448006|243996003

In order
for self re-excitation to|228877007
exist
both
,
an increase|260366006
in motor neuron excitability|31513005|102893002
and
nerve signal delay,|3057000|256864008
are
required.

Increased motor neuron excitability|35105006|31513005|102893002|260366006|31513005|102893002
is
likely|2931005
accomplished
by alterations
to the net inhibition|255442003|61511001|255442003|419495008
of neurons|47220008
occurring|272120004
as a result|394617004
of injury
to the CNS
(stroke/ spinal cord injury|230690007|90584004
).

This lack|41277001
of inhibition biases neurons|61511001|47220008|419495008|47220008
to a net excitatory state,|255442003|398070004
therefore
increasing|260369004
total signal conduction.|258755000|251089002|258755000|278252000|255619001|251089002|255619001|278252000

Signaling delay|38952000
is
present|52101004|246105001
due to an increased nerve conduction time.|35105006|22690006|410669006|260366006|22690006|410669006

Long delays|255511005
are
primarily
due to long reflex pathways,|255511005|87572000|255511005|106146005
which
are
common|72906007
in distal joints|46053002|39352004|46053002|81087007
and
muscles.|91727004

This
may
therefore
explain
why clonus|36649002
is
typically
found|404684003
in distal structures|46053002
like the ankle.|70258002|108371006|361292008

Frequency|260864003|272123002
of clonus beats|36649002
have
been
found|404684003
to
be
directly proportional|8212001
to the length|410668003
of the reflex pathway|87572000|106146005
it
is
found|404684003
in.[1]|260305007

Presence|386397008
of a central oscillator|26216008

_[1]|260305007

Clonus|36649002
with respect
to the presence|386397008
of a central oscillator,|26216008
functions|246464006
on the theory
that
when
the central oscillator|26216008
is
turned|282987006
on
by a peripheral event,|14414005|272379006
it
will
continue|255238004
to rhythmically excite [{motor neurons]}|31513005
;
therefore
creating
clonus.[1]|36649002

Although
the two proposed mechanisms|420797005|257544000
are
very different|260358002|263735002
in [theory]
and
are
still
debated,
some
studies|110465008|224699009
now
propose
the potential|30207005
of
both
mechanisms|257544000
co-existing
to
create
clonus.|36649002

It
is
thought|88952004
that
the stretch reflex pathway|63177006
may
be
stimulated
first,|255216001|232714002
and
through its events,|272379006
cause|23981006|134198009
a decreased synaptic current threshold.|1250004|15240007|118589004|260400001|15240007|118589004|260371004|15240007|118589004

This decreased synaptic current threshold|1250004|15240007|118589004|260400001|15240007|118589004|260371004|15240007|118589004
would
enhance
motor neuron excitability|31513005|102893002
as nerve impulses|3057000|263781002|256864008|263781002
would
be
more readily|242762006
conducted|844005
,
and
thus turn on|282987006
this central oscillator.|26216008

This theory
is
still
being
investigated.[1]|116698004

Clonus|36649002
tends
to
co-exist
with spasticity|397790002
in many cases|398241000|413769002
of stroke|230690007
and
spinal cord injury likely|90584004|2931005
due to their common physiological origins.|72906007|1360005|255395001

[1]|260305007
Some
consider
clonus|36649002
as
simply
an extended outcome|255536004|394617004|288467006|394617004|255590007|394617004
of spasticity.|397790002

Although
closely
linked
,
clonus|36649002
is
not
seen
in all patients|116154003
with spasticity.|397790002

Clonus|36649002
tends
to
not
be
present|52101004|246105001
with spasticity|397790002
in patients|116154003
with significantly increased muscle tone,|56731001
as
the muscles|91727004
are
constantly active|55561003
and
therefore
not
engaging|54986009
in the characteristic
on/
off cycle|44180009
of clonus.|36649002

Clonus|36649002
results|394617004
due to an increased motor neuron excitation|35105006|48388002|260366006|48388002
(decreased action potential threshold|1250004|129264002|30207005|118589004|260400001|129264002|30207005|118589004|260371004|129264002|30207005|118589004
and
is
common|72906007
in muscles|91727004
with long conduction delays,|255511005|251089002|255511005|278252000
such as the long reflex tracts|255511005|87572000|255511005|106146005
found|404684003
in distal muscle groups.|46053002|91727004|261586004|46053002|91727004|160481000

Clonus|36649002
is
commonly
seen
in the ankle|70258002|108371006|361292008
but
may
exist
in other distal structures|74964007|46053002
as well.[2]|20572008

Clonus|36649002
is
most commonly|4757001
found|404684003
at the ankle,|70258002|108371006|361292008
specifically
with a dorsiflexion/plantarflexion movement|71853007|255324009
(up and down|255532002|247524003|353734004|247524003
).

Some case studies|398241000|110465008|398241000|224699009
have
also reported clonus|229059009|36649002|223458004|36649002
in the finger,|7569003|302541005
toe,|29707007|302547009
and
laterally
in the ankle|70258002|108371006|361292008
(
as
opposed
to the typical up and down motion|255532002|247524003|56219004|353734004|247524003|56219004
).

[3]|260313008

Clonus|36649002
at the ankle|70258002|108371006|361292008
is
tested|272393004
by rapidly|418694008
flexing|9964006
the foot|56459004|259051005|302545001
into dorsiflexion
(upward|353734004
)
,
inducing|16404004
a stretch|122546009
to the gastrocnemius muscle.|35616000

Subsequent beating|255260001
of the foot|56459004|259051005|302545001
will
result|394617004
,
however only
a sustained clonus|17891004
(5 beats|264706000|264605009
or
more
)
is
considered abnormal.|263654008

Clonus|36649002
can
also
be
tested|272393004
in the knees|304679005
by rapidly|418694008
pushing|420620005
the patella|421413000|182083008
(knee cap|304679005|228254002|49076000|228254002|361291001|228254002|72696002|228254002
