*Athetosis|44913001
*
*
is
a symptom
characterized
by involuntary convoluted,|47573009
writhing
movements|255324009
of the fingers,|7569003|259052003
arms,|40983000
legs,|30021000
and
neck.|45048000|302550007

Movements|255324009
typical
of athetosis|44913001
are
sometimes
called
_athetoid_ movements.|44913001

Lesions
to the brain|12738006|258335003
are
most often|4757001|70232002
the direct cause|255589003|134198009
of the symptoms,
particularly
to the corpus striatum.|31428008|279318005

This symptom
does
not
occur|272120004
alone|105529008
and
is
often|70232002
accompanied
by the symptoms
of cerebral palsy,|128188000
as
it
is
often|70232002
a result|394617004
of this disease.|64572001

Treatments|276239002
for athetosis|44913001
are
not very effective,|260358002|255403003|260358002|254648000
and
in most cases|398241000|413769002
are
simply
aimed
at the uncontrollable movement,|255324009
rather than
the cause|134198009
itself.

Athetosis|44913001
can
vary
from mild|255604002
to severe motor dysfunction|24484000|52559000
;
it
is
generally
characterized
by unbalanced, involuntary movements|162227008
of muscle tone|6918002
and
a difficulty|371157007
maintaining|385630006
a symmetrical posture.|18772005|363855006

The associated motor dysfunction|47429007|52559000
can
be
restricted|263856008
to a part|260726005
of body|279495008|123037004
or
present|52101004|246105001
throughout the body,|279495008|123037004
depending
on the individual|125676002|385435006
and
the severity|272141005
of the symptom.

One|421379005
of the pronounced signs|72670004
can
be
observed
in the extremities|66019005|2592007
in particular,
as
the writhing,
convoluted movement|47573009|255324009
of the digits.|82680008

Athetosis|44913001
can
appear
as early|264499004
as 18 months|258706009
from birth|3950001
with first signs|276131009
including|55919000
difficulty feeding,|78164000
hypotonia,|398152000
spasm,|45352006
and
involuntary writhing movements|162227008
of the hands,|85562004
feet,|56459004|259051005
and
face,|89545001|302549007
which progressively
worsen|230993007|390772001
through adolescence|22396007
and
at times|410669006|417929005
of emotional distress.|224977004

Athetosis|44913001
is
caused|23981006|134198009
by lesions
in several brain areas|261028005|12738006|42798000|261028005|258335003|42798000
such as the hippocampus|5366008|409925000|361561007
and
the motor thalamus,|42695009|244433007
as well as
the corpus striatum|31428008|279318005
;[2] therefore children|260306008|410601007|260306008|160499008
during the developmental age|444195007
could
possibly|60022001
suffer
from cognitive deficits|260372006
such as speech impairment,|29164008
hearing loss,|343087000|15188001
and
failed
or
retarded acquirement|19367006
of sitting balance.[3]|413631000

Athetosis|44913001
is
a symptom primarily
caused|23981006|134198009
by the marbling,
or
degeneration|33359002
of the basal ganglia._[citation|32610002
needed|410525008|103325001
_]
This degeneration|33359002
is
most commonly|4757001
caused|23981006|134198009
by complications|116223007
at birth|3950001
or
by Huntington's Disease,|58756001
in addition|260364009
to rare cases|84638005|398241000|84638005|413769002|103356009|398241000|103356009|413769002
in which
the damage|37782003
may
also
arise|68727004
later in life|224130005
due to stroke|230690007
or
trauma._[citation
needed|410525008|103325001
_]
The two complications|420797005|116223007
of particular interest|225469004
are
intranatal asphyxia|66466001
and
neonatal jaundice.|387712008

Asphyxia directly|66466001
causes|134198009
basal ganglia|32610002
damage|37782003
due to lack|41277001
of oxygen|24099007
and
therefore,
insufficient nutrient supply._[citation|71978007|226355009|425398004|423437008|226355009|425398004
needed|410525008|103325001
_]
The lesions
caused|23981006|134198009
by asphyxia|66466001
are
most prominent|4757001|4657009
on the caudate nucleus|11000004|279297002
and
the putamen.|89278009|281512002

However,
a less-studied consequence|276139006|103332005|263796003|103332005
of the resulting hypoxia|42752001|389086002
is
its effect|253861007
on the concentrations|82742001
of the neurotransmitter dopamine|35069000|412383006|35069000|32779004
within the synapses|69147006
of neurons|47220008
in the basal ganglia.|32610002

Hypoxia|389086002
leads|88488004|236874000
to an increase|260366006
in the extracellular dopamine levels|69320009|412383006|258395000|69320009|32779004|258395000
and
therefore,
an increase|260366006
in the activity|48761009|55561003|258745004|257733005
of the dopaminergic neurons.|16257000|47220008

Furthermore,
this increase|260366006
in extracellular concentration|69320009|82742001
is
not
caused|23981006|134198009
by an increase|260366006
in the neurotransmitter synthesis,|35069000|11798007
but
instead
on inhibiting|61511001
its reuptake
back
into the neurons|47220008
and
glial cells.|2156000

Therefore,
there
is
an increased dopaminergic effect|35105006|16257000|253861007|260366006|16257000|253861007
as dopamine|412383006|32779004
remains
in the synapse|69147006
at higher concentrations|75540009|82742001|371879000|82742001
leading|236874000
to additional post-synaptic response.|260364009|288563008

As a result,|394617004
the uncontrollable writhing motions|56219004|272149007
witnessed
with athetosis deal|44913001
with the over-activity|21481007|48761009|21481007|55561003|21481007|258745004|21481007|257733005
of synapses|69147006
within the basal ganglia.|32610002

Neonatal jaundice|387712008
is
the other chief complication|116223007
that
leads|88488004|236874000
to the basal ganglia|32610002
damage|37782003
associated|47429007
with this condition.|260905004

Jaundice|18165001
is
caused|23981006|134198009
by hyperbilirubinemia,|14783006|26165005
or
abnormally high levels|371879000|258395000
of bilirubin|79706000
in the blood.|87612001|119273009

Bilirubin|79706000
is
usually
bound|75958009|257768005|418131003
to albumin immediately|52454007|49499008
and
sent
to the liver.|10200004|181268008

However,
in neonatal jaundice,|387712008
the concentration|82742001
of bilirubin|79706000
overwhelms
that
of albumin|52454007
and
some
of the bilirubin remains|79706000
unconjugated|103396006
and
can
enter|417985001
the brain|12738006|258335003
through the blood?brain barrier.|20245001

Normally bilirubin|79706000
would
not
be
able to|371150009
diffuse|19648000
across the blood brain barrier,|20245001
but
in infants,|418119000
the barrier
is
immature|1090009
and
has
higher permeability.|75540009|82540007|371879000|82540007

Bilirubin|79706000
is
toxic
as
it
prevents|116699007
the phosphorylation|363262008
of many proteins,|88878007
including|55919000
synapsin I|42146005|22971001
which
binds|257768005
vesicles|82515000
in the presynaptic terminal.|42796001

Therefore
it directly
inhibits|61511001
the exocytosis
of neurotransmitters|35069000
and
severely|24484000
hinders
the synapses|69147006
it
affects.|4065008

In autopsies|168461002
of children|410601007|160499008
who
suffered
from neonatal jaundice,|387712008
chronic changes|90734009|243326001|90734009|263703002
of neuronal loss,|47220008
gliosis|81415000
and
demyelination|32693004
were
observed
in the basal ganglia|32610002
and
more specifically|242762006
within the globus pallidus.[6]|14738005

Another study|110465008|224699009
was
done
where the onset|77374008
of athetoid movement|44913001
followed|367409002
a thalamic stroke.|42695009|230690007

The thalamus|42695009|244433007
is
part|260726005
of a pathway
that
is
involved|248448006
with the cortical feedback loop|68594002|261913007|40146001|261913007|50403003|261913007
in which
signals|38952000
from the cortex|40146001
are
relayed
through the striatum,|31428008
pallidus
and
thalamus|42695009|244433007
before making
it
back
to the cortex.|40146001

The striatum|31428008
receives
excitatory inputs
from the cortex|40146001
and
inhibits|61511001
the pallidum.|14738005

By
doing
so
it
frees|37837009
the thalamus|42695009|244433007
from pallidal inhibition|14738005|61511001|14738005|419495008
allowing
the thalamus to|42695009|244433007
send
excitatory outputs
to the cortex.|40146001

Therefore,
the lesions
to the thalamus|42695009|244433007
or
any other part|74964007|260726005
of this feedback loop|261913007
can
result|394617004
in movement disorders|60342002
as
they
can
alter
the reactivity|11214006
of one|421379005
towards the other.|74964007

Also,
in a case|398241000
of people|125676002
with thalamic stroke,|42695009|230690007
a majority
suffered severe sensory deficits|24484000|262139008|260372006
and
ataxia.|20262006

It
is
proposed
that
this loss
of proprioception
and
the ensuing loss
of synergic stabilization|115979005
may
also
lead|88488004
to abnormal movements,|9748009|225606002
such as those dealt
with
in athetosis.[8]|44913001

There
are
several different treatment|261028005|263735002|276239002|261028005|263735002|416118004
approaches|103379005
to dealing
with athetosis.|44913001

The most common methods|4757001|72906007|260686004|4757001|72906007|272394005
are
the use|277889008|419385000
of drugs,|410942007
surgical intervention,|83578000
and
retraining movements|255324009
of the afflicted person.|125676002

It
is
suggested
that training|118629009
a person|125676002
to relearn movements|255324009
can
be
helpful
in select situations.

Though
,
generally,
this type|261664005
of treatment|276239002|416118004
will
not
work|261041009
,
in certain cases|17162000|398241000|17162000|413769002
it
can
be
found|404684003
to
be
very helpful|260358002
in treating|28995006
the symptom
of athetosis.[9]|44913001

Drugs|410942007
can
also
be
used|394850002
in the treatment|276239002|416118004
of athetosis,|44913001
however
their collective effectiveness|255403003
is
not very convincing.|260358002

There
is
not
a single drug|125681006|410942007|50607009|410942007
that
is
a standard
among treatment.|276239002|416118004

Many different medicines|263735002|410942007
can
be
used|394850002
,
including|55919000
:

Most instances
of drug use|246488008
where the symptoms
seem
to
be
lessened
tend
to
be
in more mild cases|242762006|255604002|398241000|242762006|255604002|413769002
of athetosis.[10]|44913001

Treatment|276239002|416118004
by surgical intervention|83578000
can
obviously
have
the most immediate impact,|4757001|88694003|134293005|4757001|49499008|134293005
again however,
it
is
not
a cure-all.

In patients|116154003
that
have
cerebral palsy|128188000
as the cause|134198009
of their athetosis,|44913001
it
has
been
demonstrated
that
a subthalamotomy
tends
to
help
relieve|397855004
the extent|255590007
of athetosis|44913001
in approximately half|26175008
of patients.|116154003

Additionally,
late 19th|260383002
and
early 20th century surgical accounts|264499004|83578000
state|398070004
that athetosis|44913001
can
be
relieved|398004007
by the removal|118292001|128303001
of a part|260726005
of the cerebral motor cortex|40146001
or
by cutting|70302008|410717008
a part|260726005
of the posterior spinal roots.|255551008|69733000

Patients|116154003
who
undergo
surgical treatment to|83578000
relieve|397855004
the athetosis often|44913001|70232002
see|281004000
significant improvement|386134007
in the control|31509003
of their limbs|66019005
and
digits.|82680008

While
surgery|83578000
is
often very beneficial|70232002|260358002
in the short term
and
can
produce
near immediate results,|277752003|88694003|394617004|277752003|49499008|394617004
in the long term
it
has
been
seen
that
its effects|253861007
are
not incredibly long lasting.[4]|255511005

Chorea|271700006
is
another condition|260905004
which
results|394617004
from damage|37782003
to the basal ganglia.|32610002

Similar
to athetosis,|44913001
it
results|394617004
from mutations|55446002
affecting|247591002|248448006
the pallidum inhibition|14738005|61511001|14738005|419495008
of the thalamus|42695009|244433007
as well as
increased dopaminergic activity|28277004|16257000
at the level|258395000|276625007
of the striatum.|31428008

Considering
the etiology|134198009
of
both
disorders|64572001
are
fairly similar,
it
comes
as no
surprise
that chorea|271700006
and
athetosis|44913001
can
and
usually
do
occur|272120004
together
in a condition|260905004
called
choreoathetosis.|43105007

Athetosis|44913001
is
a commonly
occurring|272120004
symptom
in the disease cerebral palsy.|64572001|128188000

Of all people|125676002
with the disease,|64572001
between 16% [15]
and
25% [4]
of them actually
exhibit
the symptom
of athetosis.|44913001

A component|246093002
of this
is
the finding|404684003
that
most often|70232002
the symptoms
that
involve|248448006
athetosis|44913001
occur|272120004
as a part|260726005
of choreoathetosis|43105007
as
opposed
to athetosis alone.[16]|44913001|105529008

It
is
also
noteworthy
that
the presence|386397008
of athetosis|44913001
in cerebral palsy|128188000
(
as well as
other conditions|74964007|260905004
)
causes|134198009
a significant increase|386134007|260366006
in a person?s basal resting metabolic rate.|125676002|165109007|258157001|125676002|57195005|165109007

It
has
been
observed
that
those who
have
cerebral palsy|128188000
with athetosis|44913001
require
approximately 500 more Calories|26175008|258790008
per day|258703001|259032004
than their non-cerebral palsy non-athetoid counterpart.[15]|230780007

Pseudoathetosis|299952008
is
a movement disorder,|60342002
very similar|260358002
to athetosis,|44913001
in which
the symptoms
are
not differentiable
from those
of actual athetosis,|44913001
however
the underlying cause|134198009
is
different.|263735002

While
actual athetosis|44913001
is
caused|23981006|134198009
by damage|37782003
to the brain,|12738006|258335003
specifically
in the basal ganglia,|32610002
[4] pseudoathetosis|260308009|299952008
is
caused|23981006|134198009
by the loss
of proprioception.

The loss
in proprioception
is
caused|23981006|134198009
by damage|37782003
to the area|42798000
between the primary somatosensory cortex|63161005|40146001|261424001|40146001
and
the muscle spindles|12945004
and
joint receptors.|39352004|116647005|81087007|116647005|302536002|116647005

Additionally,
when
observing
an MRI,|113091000
it
can
be
seen
that
in the brain|12738006|258335003
of a psuetoathetoid patient,|116154003
lesions
on the brain|12738006|258335003
are
not
seen
in the basal ganglia,|32610002
[18]
the area|42798000
that
is
oftentimes
the cause|134198009
of athetosis.[4]|44913001

Athetosis|44913001
is
characterized
as a symptom
that
is
present|52101004|246105001
in many forms|246176004
of central nervous system disorders|23853001
that
affect|4065008
the body movement coordination,|255324009|85352007
such as cerebral palsy.|128188000

Children|410601007|160499008
may
struggle
to engage|54986009
in social communication,|263536004
since
the poor coordination
of the tongue|21974007|181226008
and
mouth muscles|74262004|91727004|123851003|91727004|21082005|91727004|181220002|91727004
can
reduce|260400001
their speech ability|371150009
and
hinder
their social interaction|225598002
to a greater degree.|263768009|258395000|263768009|246173007

The caregivers|133932002
of the affected children|247591002|410601007|247591002|160499008|248448006|410601007|248448006|160499008
are
encouraged
to closely
monitor|13288007
their nutrition|87276001|384759009
and
growth
and
to
provide
them
with hearing aids|6012004
in order to
relieve|397855004
their symptoms
as well as
supporting|9096001|243114000
their academic plans.|52713000|397943006

A growing number|410680006|410681005
of patients|116154003
is
shown to
benefit
from communication devices|263536004|303607000|263536004|49062001
such as shorthand typing programs|272395006
and
computer speech devices,|303607000|49062001
as well as
simple picture boards.|13673007|257444003|13673007|257445002

The first noted case|255216001|398241000|232714002|398241000
of athetosis|44913001
was
discovered
by [W.

A.

Hammond]
(/wiki/William_Alexander_Hammond
)
and
described
in his book _Diseases|278212002|64572001
of the Nervous System_|25087005|278196006
in 1871.

Hammond
was
also
the person|125676002
who
created
the term ?athetosis,|44913001
?
Greek|1451003
for ?
without fixed position.?|102491009|246449006|261010008|246449006
[23]|264657009
In his initial description|884001|232714002
of athetosis,|44913001
the extent|255590007
of the uncontrolled movement|19032002|255324009
was
limited|255469002
to the fingers|7569003|259052003
and
toes.|29707007

In association|263534001|272151006
with this,
he
noted
that
the patients' calves|116154003|53840002|116154003|244015008
and
forearms|14975008
were
oftentimes
flexed|9964006
and
that movements|255324009
were
generally slow.|419443000

Over the period|259037005
of time|410669006
leading|236874000
into the late 20th century,|260383002
the definition
of athetosis|44913001
was
expanded|70955005
to
include|55919000
movements|255324009
of the neck,|45048000|302550007
tongue,|21974007|181226008
face,|89545001|302549007
and
even
the trunk.|22943007|262225004

Along
with the expansion
of the symptoms
came
the recognition|312020002
that
it
was
a part|260726005
of many medical conditions,|74188005|260905004
including|55919000
cerebral palsy|128188000
and
stroke.[23]|230690007|264657009

As athetosis|44913001
is
relatively difficult to|52925006
treat|395077000
,
efforts|19487008
are
being
made to
help
those
with the condition|260905004
live|419749002
and
perform|398166005
tasks more effectively
and
more efficiently.|242762006

One|421379005
such example
of
work|261041009
that
has
been
recently|6493001
undertaken
is
a project to
help
those
affected|247591002|248448006
with athetosis to|44913001
use|277889008|419385000
a computer
with more|242762006
ease.

Software
for the control|31509003
of the computer uses|277889008|419385000
joysticks
that
perform|398166005
linear filtering to|50009006|116250002|50009006|258648006
aid|246088000
in control.[24]|31509003

An additional possible treatment option|260364009|371930009|276239002|260364009|371930009|416118004|260364009|60022001|276239002|260364009|60022001|416118004
for those
afflicted
with the symptom
is
neurostimulation.|78746004

Studies|110465008|224699009
have
begun|255395001
,
and
in cerebral palsy patients|128188000|116154003
affected|247591002|248448006
with dystonia-choreoathetosis,|43105007|15802004|43105007
it
has
been
demonstrated
that neurostimulation|78746004
has
been
an effective treatment|255403003|276239002|255403003|416118004|254648000|276239002|254648000|416118004
in lessening symptoms
in patients.|116154003

There
has
not
been
a tremendous amount|107651007
of experimentation,
though
,
in this as a possible treatment option.[25]|371930009|276239002|371930009|416118004|60022001|276239002|60022001|416118004
