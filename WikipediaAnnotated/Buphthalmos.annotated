(plural buphthalmias|260396001
).

It usually
appears
in the newborn period|133933007|259037005|46068001|259037005|255407002|259037005
or
the first 3 months|255216001|258706009|232714002|258706009
of life.|224130005

and
in most cases|398241000|413769002
indicates|410535002
the presence|386397008
of congenital|6160004|255399007
(infantile) glaucoma,|413728006
which
is
a disorder|64572001
in which
elevated|75540009
pressures|279046003|13543005
within the eye|81745001|244486005
lead|88488004
to structural eye damage|81745001|37782003|244486005|37782003
and
vision loss.

Infantile glaucoma,|413728006
which often|70232002
produces
the clinical sign|58147004|72670004
of buphthalmos,|413728006
can
be
caused|23981006|134198009
when
an abnormally
narrow|18043004|25659002|134223000
angle|1483009
between the cornea|28726007|181162001
and
iris|41296002|27527003|181164000
blocks|26036001
the outflow
of aqueous humor|425460003|280587006
;[3]|260313008
this causes|134198009
increased|35105006|260366006
intraocular pressure|41633001|252832004|370960006
and
eventual enlargement|56246009|118452000|442021009
of the globe|81745001|244486005
(eyeball|81745001
).

Angle closure|251726002
can
be
caused|23981006|134198009
by developmental abnormalities|276654001
of the eye|81745001|244486005
as well as
the presence|386397008
of abnormal structures|263654008
within the vitreous.[4]

Buphthalmos|413728006
in itself
is
merely
a clinical sign|58147004|72670004
and
does
not
generate
symptoms.

Patients|116154003
with glaucoma often initially|23986001|70232002|884001
have
no symptoms
;
later,
they
can
exhibit
excessive tearing|418035005
and
extreme sensitivity|12565001|35209006|12565001|365705006
to light|56242006|371268001
(photophobia.|409668002

On ophthalmologic exam,|394594003|225886003|239005|225886003
one|421379005
can
detect|260373001
increased intraocular pressure,|112222000
distortion|20967005
of the optic disc,|81016008
and
corneal edema,|27194006
which
manifests|250255003
as haziness.

Untreated glaucoma|25265005|23986001
leads|88488004|236874000
to total blindness.|258755000|255619001

Surgical treatment|83578000
is
required.

Presently-utilized surgical procedures|83578000
include|55919000
goniotomy,|265292003
trabeculotomy,|82736000
or
trabeculectomy.|231734003

The name
of the condition|260905004
derives
from the Greek ????|1451003
_bous_
(ox|73169008
or
cow|34618005
)
,
referring|439980006
to the bulging eyes|18265008
common|72906007
to bovines.

US musical legend Ray Charles,|107315007|82107009
who
was
totally blind
by age 7,|424144002
had
probably
been
afflicted
glaucoma|23986001
and
may
have
had
buphthalmos early in life.[5]|413728006|264499004|224130005
