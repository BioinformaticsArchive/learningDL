*Microcephaly|1829003
*
*
is
a neurodevelopmental disorder|64572001
in which
the circumference|74551000
of the head|69536005|302548004
is
more
than two standard deviations|420797005|386136009
smaller|263796003|255507004
than average
for the person's age|125676002|424144002
and
sex.|258139002|365952006|263495000|70256003|57312000

Microcephaly|1829003
may
be
congenital|6160004|255399007
or
it
may
develop
in the first few years|255216001|258707000|232714002|258707000
of life.|224130005

The disorder|64572001
may
stem
from a wide variety|90522003
of conditions|260905004
that
cause|23981006|134198009
abnormal growth|263654008
of the brain,|12738006|258335003
or
from syndromes
associated|47429007
with chromosomal abnormalities.|409709004

Two copies|420797005
of a loss-
of-function mutation|246464006|55446002
in one|421379005
of the _microcephalin_ genes|67271001
causes|134198009
primary microcephaly.|271572004

In general, life expectancy|60132005|224130005|410517006
for individuals|125676002|385435006
with microcephaly|1829003
is
reduced|260400001
and
the prognosis|20481000
for normal brain function|17621005|12738006|246464006|17621005|258335003|246464006|258744000|12738006|246464006|258744000|258335003|246464006
is
poor.|11403006|255351007

The prognosis|20481000
varies
depending
on the presence|386397008
of associated abnormalities.|47429007|276654001

Microcephaly|1829003
is
a type|261664005
of cephalic disorder.|66787007|64572001

A genetic factor|3950001|255395001
may
play|300776002
a role
in causing|23981006
some cases|398241000|413769002
of microcephaly.|1829003

Relations|125677006
have
been
found|404684003
between autism,|408856003
duplications|89049001
of chromosomes|91272006
and
macrocephaly|19410003
on one side.|66459002

On the other side|74964007|182353008
a relation|125677006
has
been
found|404684003
between schizophrenia,|58214004
deletions
of chromosomes|91272006
and
microcephaly.[1][2][3]|1829003

"Microcephaly" means "small head"|1829003|255586005|271611007
(literal translation
from the Greek "????? ??????"|1451003
).

"Microencephaly" means "small brain".|1829003|255586005|255507004|12738006|1829003|255586005|255507004|258335003

Because
the size|277049003
of the head|69536005|302548004
is
mostly
determined
by the size|277049003
of the brain,|12738006|258335003
microencephaly|1829003
is
implied
when
discussing
microcephaly.[4]|1829003

Microcephaly|1829003
can
also
be
associated|47429007
with other conditions|74964007|260905004
that
are
only indirectly|50607009|420295001
associated|47429007
with the nervous system|25087005|278196006
:

After the dropping|426684005|404218003
of atomic bombs|290004009|54807002
on Hiroshima
and
Nagasaki,
several women|261028005|224526002
close|29179001
to ground zero|15537006|258317007
who
had
been
pregnant|77386006|127362006
at the time|410669006
gave|419582001
birth|3950001
to children|410601007|160499008
with microcephaly.|1829003

Microcephaly prevalence|1829003
was
7
out of a group|261586004|160481000|389109008
of 11 pregnant women|255409004
at 11?17 weeks|258705008
of gestation|289908002
who
survived
the blast|90391002
at less|276139006|263796003
than 1.2 km|303183002
from ground zero.|15537006|258317007

Due to their proximity
to the bomb,|54807002
the pregnant women's|255409004
in utero children|35039007|410601007|35039007|160499008
received
a biologically significant radiation dosage|12893009|386134007|30821001|277406006|12893009|386134007|82107009|277406006|12893009|386134007|108290001|277406006
that
was
relatively high|75540009|371879000
due to the massive neutron output|46998006|58607005
of the lower explosive-|261122009|66113009

Microcephaly|1829003
is
the only proven malformation,|50607009|277025001|276654001|420295001|277025001|276654001
or
congenital abnormality,|276654001
found|404684003
in the children|410601007|160499008
of Hiroshima
and
Nagasaki.[6]

Affected newborns generally|247591002|133933007|248448006|133933007
have
striking neurological defects|1199008|6920004
and
seizures.|91175000

Severely|24484000
impaired|260379002|40226000
intellectual development|278923009
is
common,|72906007
but
disturbances
in motor functions|52479005
may
not
appear
until later in life.|260383002|224130005

Infants|418119000
with microcephaly|1829003
are
born|106970005|81827009|398209006
with
either
a normal|17621005|258744000
or
reduced head size.|260400001|248370008

Subsequently
the head|69536005|302548004
fails
to
grow
while
the face|89545001|302549007
continues|255238004
to
develop
at a normal rate,|17621005|258744000
producing
a child|410601007|160499008
with a small head|271611007
and
a receding forehead,|52795006
and
a loose, often wrinkled scalp.|78799005|70232002|247434009|41695006|78799005|70232002|247434009|181480002|78799005|70232002|27367001|41695006|78799005|70232002|27367001|181480002

As the child|410601007|160499008
grows
older,|70753007
the smallness|263796003|255507004
of the skull|89546000
becomes
more obvious,|242762006
although
the entire body also|255503000|279495008|255503000|123037004|260232004|279495008|260232004|123037004
is
often underweight|70232002|248342006
and
dwarfed.|237837007

Development|278923009
of motor functions|52479005
and
speech
may
be
delayed.

Hyperactivity|44548000
and
mental retardation|91138005
are
common occurrences,|72906007|272120004
although
the degree|258395000|246173007
of each
varies.

Convulsions
may
also
occur.|272120004

Motor ability|371150009
varies
,
ranging
from clumsiness|7006003
in some
to spastic quadriplegia|192965001
in others.|74964007

Generally there
is
no specific treatment|69658003|276239002|69658003|416118004
for microcephaly.|1829003

Treatment|276239002|416118004
is
symptomatic|264931009
and
supportive.

Microcephalics|1829003
were
sometimes
sold
to freak
shows
in North America|223503004
and
Europe|223502009
in the 19th
and
early 20th century,|264499004
where
they
were
known|36692007
by the name "
pinheads
".

Many
of them
were
presented|246105001
as different species|263735002|69658003
(
e.g.
,
"monkey man"|54121002|248153007|54121002|339947000|54121002|278412004
)
and
described
as
being
the missing link,
but
it
was
also common|72906007
for them to
be
presented|246105001
as the last surviving Aztec.|67931002

Famous examples
are
Zip
the Pinhead
(
although
he
may
not
have
had
microcephaly|1829003
)
[8]
and
Schlitzie
the Pinhead,
[9]
who also
starred
in the 1932 movie Freaks.
