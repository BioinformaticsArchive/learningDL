*Influenza|6142004|396425006
*
*,
commonly
known|36692007
as the
*
*flu|6142004
*
*,
is
an infectious disease|191415002
of birds|387972009
and
mammals|387976007
caused|23981006|134198009
by RNA viruses|11705000
of the family Orthomyxoviridae,|55014007
the influenza viruses.|55014007

The most common symptoms|4757001|72906007
are
chills,|43724002
fever,|386661006
sore throat,|405737000|267102003
muscle pains,|68962001
headache|25064002
(often severe|70232002|24484000
)
,
coughing|272039006
,
weakness/fatigue|13791008|84229001|84229001|260407003|84229001
and
general discomfort.|60132005|367391008|60132005|87128005

Although
it
is
often|70232002
confused|286933003
with other influenza-like illnesses,|74964007|95891005
especially
the common cold,|82272006|54150009
influenza|6142004|396425006
is
a more severe disease|242762006|24484000|64572001
caused|23981006|134198009
by a different type|263735002|261664005
of virus.|49872002

Influenza|6142004|396425006
may
produce
nausea|422587007
and
vomiting,|249497008
particularly
in children,|410601007|160499008
[1]|260305007
but
these symptoms
are
more common|242762006|72906007
in the unrelated gastroenteritis,|262241003|25374005
which
is
sometimes inaccurately
referred|439980006
to
as
"stomach flu"|12463005
or
"24-hour flu".[3]|123027009|6142004|259029002|6142004

Flu|6142004
can
occasionally
lead|88488004
to pneumonia,|205237003
either
direct viral pneumonia|255589003|75570004
or
secondary bacterial pneumonia,|308906005
even
for persons|125676002
who
are
usually very healthy.|260358002|263775005

In particular
it
is
a warning
sign|72670004
if
a child|410601007|160499008
(
or
presumably
an adult|133936004
)
seems
to
be
getting better|3442003
and
then
relapses|263855007
with a high fever|75540009|386661006|371879000|386661006
as this relapse|263855007|255318003|58184002
may
be
bacterial pneumonia.|53084003

Another warning sign|72670004
is
if
the person|125676002
starts|255395001|385652002
to
have
trouble breathing.[6]|14910006|258162000

Typically,
influenza|6142004|396425006
is
transmitted|60117003|258150004
through the air|417696007
by coughs|272039006|289114008
or
sneezes,|162367006
creating
aerosols|64242006|52262001
containing|42504009
the virus.|49872002

Influenza|6142004|396425006
can
also
be
transmitted|60117003|258150004
by direct contact|255589003|11723008|255589003|70862002
with bird droppings|304635007
or
nasal secretions,|260540009|46242002|46242002
or
through contact|11723008|70862002
with contaminated surfaces.|62604006|410678000

Airborne aerosols|64242006|52262001
have
been
thought|88952004
to
cause|23981006|134198009
most infections,
although
which means|255586005
of transmission|258150004
is
most important|4757001
is
not absolutely
clear.|263707001

Influenza viruses|55014007
can
be
inactivated
by sunlight,|49926000
disinfectants|311942001
and
detergents.|264299001

As the virus|49872002
can
be
inactivated
by soap,|25780000
frequent|70232002
hand washing|258154008
reduces|260400001
the risk|30207005
of infection.[11]

Influenza|6142004|396425006
spreads|410677005
around the world
in seasonal epidemics,|21864008
resulting|42752001
in about three to five million yearly cases|421291004|421820001|53281000|398241000|421291004|421820001|53281000|413769002
of severe illness|24484000|39104002
and
about 250,000
to 500,000 yearly deaths,|53281000|419620001|53281000|268923008
[12] rising
to millions
in some pandemic years.|258707000

In the 20th century three influenza pandemics|421291004|6142004|421291004|396425006
occurred|272120004
,
each
caused|23981006|134198009
by the appearance|386548000|255412001
of a new strain|7147002|48532005|7147002|276768000
of the virus|49872002
in humans,|278412004
and
killed tens|248007002
of millions
of people.|125676002

Often,|70232002
new influenza strains|7147002|6142004|48532005|7147002|6142004|276768000|7147002|396425006|48532005|7147002|396425006|276768000
appear
when
an existing flu virus|6142004|49872002|6142004
spreads|410677005
to humans|278412004
from another animal species,|387961004|69658003
or
when
an existing human strain picks|278412004|48532005|278412004|276768000
up new genes|7147002|67271001
from a virus|49872002
that usually
infects
birds|387972009
or
pigs.|106996007|78678003

An avian strain named H5N1|387972009|48532005|27468005|55604004|387972009|276768000|27468005|55604004
raised|260399008
the concern
of a new influenza|7147002|6142004|7147002|396425006
pandemic
after
it
emerged
in Asia|223500001
in the 1990s,
but
it
has
not
evolved|59381007
to a form|246176004
that
spreads|410677005
easily|36203004
between people.|125676002

In April 2009
a novel flu strain|7147002|6142004|48532005|7147002|6142004|276768000
evolved|59381007
that combined genes|89780004|67271001
from human,|278412004
pig,|78678003|388393002|388392007
and
bird flu.|55604004

Initially|884001
dubbed
"swine flu"|442696006
and
also
known|36692007
as influenza A/H1N1,|6142004|303175008|396425006|303175008
it
emerged
in Mexico,|223687006
the United States,|223688001
and
several other nations.|261028005

The World Health Organization officially|263775005|21139007
declared
the outbreak to|443684005
be
a pandemic
on 11 June 2009
(
see|281004000
2009 flu|6142004
pandemic.

The WHO's declaration
of a pandemic level 6|258395000|276625007
was
an indication|410666004
of spread,|410677005
not severity,|272141005
the strain actually|48532005|276768000
having
a lower mortality rate|261122009|409651001
than common flu outbreaks.[14]|72906007|6142004|443684005

Vaccinations
against influenza|6142004|396425006
are
usually
made
available|103328004
to people|125676002
in developed countries.|223369002

Farmed poultry|224816003|359839008|224816003|28230009
is
often|70232002
vaccinated to
avoid
decimation
of the flocks.|419668007

The most common human vaccine|4757001|72906007|278412004|398827000
is
the trivalent influenza vaccine (TIV)|396425006
that
contains|42504009
purified
and
inactivated antigens|7120007
against three viral strains.|421291004|48532005|421291004|276768000

Typically,
this vaccine|398827000
includes|55919000
material|260769002
from two influenza A virus subtypes|420797005|407479009|260837004
and
one influenza B virus strain.|421379005|407480007|48532005|421379005|407480007|276768000

The TIV
carries|288345009
no risk|30207005
of transmitting|60117003
the disease,|64572001
and
it
has
very low reactivity.|260362008|11214006

A vaccine|398827000
formulated
for one year|421379005|258707000|421379005|259039008
may
be
ineffective
in the following year,|255260001|258707000|255260001|259039008
since
the influenza virus|55014007
evolves|59381007
rapidly,|418694008
and
new strains quickly|7147002|48532005|7147002|276768000
replace|282089006|370124000
the older ones.|70753007|421379005

Antiviral drugs|372701006
such as the neuraminidase inhibitor oseltamivir|409228005|412261005
(Tamiflu
)
have
been
used|394850002
to
treat|395077000
influenza|6142004|396425006
;[18] however,
their effectiveness|255403003
is
difficult to|52925006
determine
due to much|242762006|4757001
of the data
remaining
unpublished.[19]

Approximately 33%|26175008|264667004
of people|125676002
with influenza|6142004|396425006
are
asymptomatic.[22]|84387000

Symptoms
of influenza|6142004|396425006
can
start|255395001
quite suddenly
one|421379005
to two days|420797005|258703001
after infection.

Usually
the first symptoms|255216001|232714002
are
chills|43724002
or
a chilly sensation,|43724002|106148006|43724002|271712005|43724002|272144002
but
fever|386661006
is
also common early|72906007|264499004
in the infection,
with body temperatures|105723007
ranging
from 38?39 ?C|264670000
(approximately 100?103 ?F|26175008|372639009
).

Many people|260396001|125676002
are
so ill|223528007|367391008
that
they
are
confined
to bed|229772003
for several days,|261028005|258703001
with aches|410711009
and
pains|22253000
throughout their bodies,|279495008|123037004
which
are
worse|230993007|390772001|231877006
in their backs|123961009
and
legs.|30021000

Symptoms
of influenza|6142004|396425006
may
include|55919000
:

It
can
be
difficult to|52925006
distinguish
between the common cold|82272006|54150009
and
influenza|6142004|396425006
in the early stages|264499004|261612004
of these infections,
[2]|260306008
but
a flu|6142004
can
be
identified|7882003
by a high fever|75540009|386661006|371879000|386661006
with a sudden onset|385315009|255363002
and
extreme fatigue.|84229001

Diarrhea|398032003
is
not normally
a symptom
of influenza|6142004|396425006
in adults,|133936004
[20]
although
it
has
been
seen
in some human cases|278412004|398241000|278412004|413769002
of the H5N1 "bird flu"[28]|55604004|55604004
and
can
be
a symptom
in children.|410601007|160499008

The symptoms most reliably
seen
in influenza|6142004|396425006
are
shown
in the table|86407004
to the right.[20]|24028007

Since
antiviral drugs|372701006
are
effective|255403003|254648000
in treating influenza|28995006|6142004|28995006|396425006
if
given|419582001
early|264499004
(
see|281004000
treatment section,|276239002|62083003|276239002|118630004|416118004|62083003|416118004|118630004
below
)
,
it
can
be
important to
identify|7882003
cases early.|398241000|264499004|413769002|264499004

Of the symptoms
listed
above,|261183002
the combinations|228166004
of fever|386661006
with cough,|272039006
sore throat|405737000|267102003
and/or
nasal congestion|68235000
can
improve|385425000|3442003|385633008
diagnostic accuracy.|439401001|263656005|261004008|263656005

Two decision analysis studies[30][31]|420797005|272389005|110465008|264664006|420797005|272389005|224699009|264664006
suggest
that _
during local outbreaks_|255470001|443684005
of influenza,|6142004|396425006
the prevalence
will
be
over 70%,|21481007
[31]|264664006
and
thus patients|116154003
with any
of these combinations|228166004
of symptoms
may
be
treated|28995006
with neuraminidase inhibitors|409228005
without testing.|272393004

Even
in the absence|2667000|418560003
of a local outbreak,|255470001|443684005
treatment|276239002|416118004
may
be
justified
in the elderly|105436006
during the influenza season|6142004|21864008|396425006|21864008
as long|255511005
as the prevalence
is
over 15%.[31]|21481007|264664006

The available laboratory tests|103328004|269814003
for influenza|6142004|396425006
continue|255238004
to
improve.|385425000|3442003|385633008

The United States Centers for Disease Control|223688001|26216008|64572001|31509003
and
Prevention|169443000
(CDC
)
maintains|385630006
an up-to-date summary|255532002|410671006
of available laboratory tests.|103328004|269814003

According to the CDC,
rapid diagnostic tests|255358001|103693007
have
a sensitivity|35209006|365705006
of 70?75%
and
specificity|69658003
of 90?95%|264705001|264703008
when
compared
with viral culture.|12717000

These tests|269814003|272393004
may
be
especially useful
during the influenza season|6142004|21864008|396425006|21864008
(prevalence
=25%
)
but
in the absence|2667000|418560003
of a local outbreak,|255470001|443684005
or
peri-influenza season|272114000|6142004|21864008|272114000|396425006|21864008
(prevalence
=10%[31]|264664006
).

On the more serious side,|242762006|42745003|182353008
influenza|6142004|396425006
can
occasionally
cause|23981006|134198009
either
direct viral|255589003
or
secondary bacterial pneumonia.|308906005

The obvious symptom
is
trouble breathing.|14910006|258162000

In addition,|260364009
if
a child|410601007|160499008
(
or
presumably
an adult|133936004
)
seems
to
be
getting better|3442003
and
then
relapses|263855007
with a high fever,|75540009|386661006|371879000|386661006
that
is
a danger sign|72670004
since
this relapse|263855007|255318003|58184002
can
be
bacterial pneumonia.[7]|53084003

In virus classification influenza viruses|49872002|73504009|55014007|73504009|55014007
are
RNA viruses|11705000
that make up three|255532002|421291004|353734004|421291004
of the five genera|421820001|18511007
of the family Orthomyxoviridae|55014007
:
[33]|264667004

These viruses|49872002
are
only distantly|50607009|261007001|420295001|261007001
related|272151006|262094002
to the human parainfluenza viruses,|407498006
which
are
RNA viruses|11705000
belonging
to the paramyxovirus family|35359004
that
are
a common cause|72906007|134198009
of respiratory infections|275498002
in children|410601007|160499008
such as croup,|71186008
[34]
but
can
also
cause|23981006|134198009
a disease|64572001
similar
to influenza|6142004|396425006
in adults.[35]|133936004

This genus|18511007
has
one species,|421379005|69658003
influenza A virus.|407479009

Wild aquatic birds|33964005
are
the natural hosts|510009
for a large variety|255509001
of influenza A.|6142004|396425006

Occasionally,
viruses|49872002
are
transmitted|60117003|258150004
to other species|74964007|69658003
and
may
then
cause|23981006|134198009
devastating outbreaks|443684005
in domestic poultry|261770009|359839008|261770009|28230009
or
give|419582001
rise
to human influenza pandemics.|6142004

The type A viruses|277234002
are
the most virulent human pathogens|4757001|278412004|264418008
among the three influenza types|421291004|6142004|261664005|421291004|396425006|261664005
and
cause|23981006|134198009
the most severe disease.|4757001|24484000|64572001

The influenza A virus|407479009
can
be
subdivided
into different serotypes|263735002|276770009
based|418836005
on the antibody response|68498002|112133008
to these viruses.|49872002

The serotypes|276770009
that
have
been
confirmed|59156000
in humans,|278412004
ordered
by the number|410680006|410681005
of known human pandemic deaths,|36692007|278412004|419620001|36692007|278412004|268923008
are
:

This genus|18511007
has
one species,|421379005|69658003
influenza B virus.|407480007

Influenza B almost exclusively|6142004|396425006
infects
humans[37]|278412004
and
is
less common|276139006|72906007|263796003|72906007
than influenza A.|6142004|396425006

The only other animals|50607009|387961004|420295001|387961004
known|36692007
to
be
susceptible|131196009
to influenza B infection|6142004|396425006
are
the seal[39]|19314006|106980009
and
the ferret.

This type|261664005
of influenza|6142004|396425006
mutates|55446002
at a rate 2?3 times|410669006|417929005
slower|419443000
than type A[41]|261664005
and
consequently
is
less genetically diverse,|276139006|263796003
with only one influenza B serotype.|50607009|421379005|6142004|276770009|50607009|421379005|396425006|276770009|420295001|421379005|6142004|276770009|420295001|421379005|396425006|276770009

As a result|394617004
of this lack|41277001
of antigenic diversity,|7120007
a degree|258395000|246173007
of immunity|58915005
to influenza B|6142004|396425006
is
usually
acquired|255396000
at an early age.|264499004|424144002

However,
influenza B|6142004|396425006
mutates|55446002
enough
that lasting immunity|58915005
is
not possible.|371930009|60022001

This reduced rate|260400001
of antigenic change,|7120007|243326001|7120007|263703002
combined|89780004
with its limited host range|255469002
(inhibiting cross species antigenic shift,|61511001|277770000|9546005
ensures
that pandemics
of influenza B|6142004|396425006
do
not
occur.[43]|272120004

This genus|18511007
has
one species,|421379005|69658003
influenza C virus,|407482004
which
infects
humans,|278412004
dogs|448771007
and
pigs,|106996007|78678003
sometimes
causing|23981006
both
severe illness|24484000|39104002
and
local epidemics.|255470001

However,
influenza C|6142004|396425006
is
less common|276139006|72906007|263796003|72906007
than the other types|74964007|261664005
and
usually only
causes|134198009
mild disease|255604002|64572001
in children.[46][47]|410601007|160499008

Influenzaviruses|55014007
A,
B
and
C
are
very similar|260358002
in overall structure.

The virus particle|285296008
is
80?120 nanometers|258675004
in diameter|81827009
and
usually roughly spherical,|34258004
although
filamentous forms|246176004
can
occur.|272120004

These filamentous forms|246176004
are
more common|242762006|72906007
in influenza C,|6142004|396425006
which
can
form|246176004
cordlike structures
up to 500 micrometers|258674000
long|255511005
on the surfaces|410678000
of infected cells.|4421005

However,
despite
these varied shapes,|107644003
the viral particles|285296008
of all influenza viruses|55014007
are
similar
in composition.

These
are
made
of a viral envelope|115427003
containing|42504009
two main types|420797005|63161005|261664005
of glycoproteins,|59804006
wrapped|262318008
around a central core.|29144003

The central core|29144003
contains|42504009
the viral RNA genome|26497001|27888000
and
other viral proteins|74964007|88878007
that package
and
protect
this RNA.|27888000

RNA|27888000
tends
to
be
single stranded|125681006|50607009
but
in special cases|67995009|398241000|67995009|413769002
it
is
double.|1305003

Unusually
for a virus,|49872002
its genome|18470003
is
not
a single piece|125681006|50607009
of nucleic acid|27380003
;
instead,
it
contains|42504009
seven|420359007
or
eight pieces|421825006
of segmented negative-sense RNA,|264193005|260385009|106148006|27888000
each piece
of RNA|27888000
containing|42504009
either
one|421379005
or
two genes,|420797005|67271001
which
code
for a gene product|88878007
(protein|88878007
).

For example,
the influenza A genome|6142004|18470003|396425006|18470003
contains|42504009
11 genes|67271001
on eight pieces|421825006
of RNA,|27888000
encoding
for 11 proteins|88878007
:
hemagglutinin (HA),
neuraminidase (NA),|80837006
nucleoprotein (NP),|71185007
M1,
M2,|278077005
NS1,|205824006
NS2
(NEP
:
nuclear export protein|84640000|88878007
)
,
PA,
PB1
(polymerase basic 1|418836005
)
,
PB1-F2|258997004
and
PB2.[52]

Hemagglutinin (HA)
and
neuraminidase (NA)|80837006
are
the two large glycoproteins|420797005|255509001|59804006
on the outside of the viral particles.|261074009|285296008

HA
is
a lectin|10669005
that
mediates|73510009
binding|257768005
of the virus to target cells|49872002|259686006|259686006
and
entry
of the viral genome|26497001
into the target cell,|259686006
while
NA|385432009
is
involved|248448006
in the release|58000006|68776005|258760001|129299003|115956009
of progeny virus|160499008|49872002|160499008
from infected cells,|4421005
by cleaving sugars|227389000|74801000|9094003|74801000|58604003|74801000
that
bind|257768005
the mature viral particles.|34071009|285296008

Thus,
these proteins|88878007
are
targets
for antiviral drugs.|372701006

Furthermore,
they
are
antigens|7120007
to which antibodies|68498002
can
be
raised.|260399008

Influenza A viruses|407479009
are
classified|73504009
into subtypes|260837004
based|418836005
on antibody responses|68498002|112133008
to HA
and
NA.|385432009

These different types|263735002|261664005
of HA
and
NA|385432009
form|246176004
the basis|418836005
of the _H_|89177007|258322007|286551008
and
_N_ distinctions|258310009
in,
for example,
_H5N1_.|55604004

There
are
16 H|89177007|258322007|286551008
and
9 N subtypes|260837004
known|36692007
,
but
only H 1,|50607009|13523004|420295001|13523004
2
and
3,
and
N 1|258310009
and
2
are
commonly
found|404684003
in humans.[56]|278412004

Viruses|49872002
can
replicate|1305003|27582007
only
in living cells.|4421005

Influenza infection|6142004|396425006
and
replication|74256009
is
a multi-step process|260396001|398298007|415178003
:
First,|255216001|232714002
the virus|49872002
has
to
bind|257768005
to
and
enter|417985001
the cell,|4421005|362837007
then
deliver
its genome|18470003
to a site|10546003
where it
can
produce
new copies|7147002
of viral proteins|88878007
and
RNA,|27888000
assemble
these components|246093002
into new viral particles,|7147002|285296008
and
,
last,
exit|5173006
the host cell.[51]|4421005|362837007

Influenza viruses|55014007
bind|257768005
through hemagglutinin
onto sialic acid sugars|43211003|74801000
on the surfaces|410678000
of epithelial cells,|4212006|395202001
typically
in the nose,|260540009|181195007
throat,|54066008|49928004|264231000
and
lungs|39607008
of mammals,|387976007
and
intestines|261093006
of birds|387972009
(Stage 1|258215001
in infection figure
).

After the hemagglutinin
is
cleaved|227389000|9094003|58604003
by a protease,|116536008
the cell|4421005|362837007
imports
the virus|49872002
by endocytosis.[59]

The intracellular details|83167003
are
still
being
worked out.|73438004

It
is
known|36692007
that virions converge|285296008
to the microtubule organizing center,|34783000|385650005|26216008
interact
with acidic endosomes|34957004
and
finally
enter|417985001
the target endosomes
for genome release.[60]|18470003|58000006|18470003|68776005|18470003|258760001|18470003|129299003|18470003|115956009

Once
inside the cell,|4421005|362837007
the acidic conditions|34957004|260905004
in the endosome cause two events|134198009|420797005|272379006
to happen
:
First,|255216001|232714002
part|260726005
of the hemagglutinin protein|88878007
fuses
the viral envelope|115427003
with the vacuole's membrane,|83097008
then
the M2 ion channel|278077005|48006008|255592004
allows
protons to|89177007
move|302000008|384598002|370125004
through the viral envelope|115427003
and
acidify
the core|260235002
of the virus,|49872002
which
causes|134198009
the core|260235002
to dissemble
and
release|58000006|68776005|258760001|129299003|115956009
the viral RNA|27888000
and
core proteins.|260235002|88878007

The viral RNA (vRNA) molecules,|27888000|290005005
accessory proteins|88878007
and
RNA-dependent RNA polymerase|43751004
are
then
released|68776005|129299003
into the cytoplasm
(Stage 2|258219007
).

The M2 ion channel|278077005|48006008|255592004
is
blocked|26036001|112232007
by amantadine drugs,|372763006|410942007
preventing|116699007
infection.[62]

These core proteins|260235002|88878007
and
vRNA
form|246176004
a complex|103360007
that
is
transported|57188001|360300001
into the cell nucleus,|84640000
where
the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase|43751004
begins|255395001
transcribing complementary positive-sense vRNA|258758003|106148006|10828004|106148006
(Steps 3a|398298007
and
b
).

The vRNA
either
is
exported
into the cytoplasm
and
translated
(step 4|398298007
)
or
remains
in the nucleus.|84640000

Newly
synthesized
viral proteins|88878007
are
either
secreted
through the Golgi apparatus|65251009
onto the cell surface|4421005|410678000|362837007|410678000
(
in the case|398241000
of neuraminidase|80837006
and
hemagglutinin,
step 5b|398298007
)
or
transported|57188001|360300001
back
into the nucleus to|84640000
bind|257768005
vRNA
and
form|246176004
new viral genome particles|7147002|285296008|18470003
(step 5a|398298007
).

Other viral proteins|74964007|88878007
have
multiple actions|260396001|129264002
in the host cell,|4421005|362837007
including|55919000
degrading cellular mRNA|4421005|69908008
and
using|260676000
the released nucleotides|68776005|71211001|129299003|71211001
for vRNA synthesis|11798007
and
also
inhibiting|61511001
translation
of host-cell mRNAs.[64]|4421005|69908008|362837007|69908008

Negative-sense vRNAs|260385009|106148006
that
form|246176004
the genomes|18470003
of future viruses,|49872002
RNA-dependent RNA polymerase,|43751004
and
other viral proteins|74964007|88878007
are
assembled
into a virion.|285296008

Hemagglutinin
and
neuraminidase molecules|80837006|290005005
cluster
into a bulge|442672001
in the cell membrane.|53982002

The vRNA
and
viral core proteins|115426007|88878007
leave|7771000|90737002
the nucleus|84640000
and
enter|417985001
this membrane protrusion|83097008|112639008
(step 6|398298007
).

The mature virus buds|34071009|49872002|34071009
off
from the cell|4421005|362837007
in a sphere|34258004
of host phospholipid membrane,|78447009|83097008
acquiring|255396000
hemagglutinin
and
neuraminidase|80837006
with this membrane coat|83097008|228224007
(step 7|398298007
).

As
before,|236874000|421718005
the viruses|49872002
adhere|102491009
to the cell|4421005|362837007
through hemagglutinin
;
the mature viruses detach|34071009|49872002
once their neuraminidase|80837006
has
cleaved sialic acid residues|227389000|43211003|65320000|9094003|43211003|65320000|58604003|43211003|65320000
from the host cell.|4421005|362837007

Drugs|410942007
that
inhibit|61511001
neuraminidase,|80837006
such as oseltamivir,|412261005
therefore,
prevent
the release|58000006|68776005|258760001|129299003|115956009
of new infectious viruses|255219008|49872002
and
halt viral replication.|74256009

After the release|58000006|68776005|258760001|129299003|115956009
of new influenza viruses,|7147002|55014007
the host cell dies.|4421005|362837007

Because of the absence|2667000|418560003
of RNA proofreading enzymes,|27888000|90668006
the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase|43751004
that
copies
the viral genome|26497001
makes
an error roughly
every 10 thousand nucleotides,|71211001
which
is
the approximate length|26175008|410668003
of the influenza vRNA.|6142004|396425006

Hence,
the majority
of newly manufactured influenza viruses|55014007
are
mutants
;
this causes antigenic drift,|134198009|7120007
which
is
a slow change|419443000|243326001|419443000|263703002
in the antigens|7120007
on the viral surface|410678000
over time.|410669006

The separation|16640008|160788005
of the genome|18470003
into eight separate segments|421825006|263869007|264193005
of vRNA
allows
mixing|26242008
or
reassortment
of vRNAs
if
more
than one type|421379005|261664005
of influenza virus|55014007
infects
a single cell.|125681006|4421005|125681006|362837007|50607009|4421005|50607009|362837007

The resulting rapid change|42752001|255358001|243326001|42752001|255358001|263703002
in viral genetics
produces
antigenic shifts,|7120007|9546005
which
are
sudden changes|255363002|243326001|255363002|263703002
from one antigen|421379005|7120007
to another.

These sudden large changes|255363002|255509001|243326001|255363002|255509001|263703002
allow
the virus to|49872002
infect
new host species|7147002|69658003
and
quickly
overcome
protective immunity.|58915005

This
is
important
in the emergence
of pandemics,
as
discussed
below
in the section|62083003|118630004
on Epidemiology.

Influenza virus shedding|55014007
(
the time|410669006
during which
a person|125676002
might
be
infectious
to another person|125676002
)
begins|255395001
the day|258703001|259032004
before symptoms
appear
and
virus|49872002
is
then
released|68776005|129299003
for
between 5|264706000|264605009
to 7 days,|258703001
although
some people|125676002
may
shed
virus|49872002
for longer periods.|255511005|259037005

People|125676002
who
contract|78558002
influenza|6142004|396425006
are
most infective|4757001
between the second|81170007|257997001|288495006
and
third days|70905002|258703001
after infection.

The amount|107651007
of virus|49872002
shed
appears
to
correlate
with fever,|386661006
with higher amounts|75540009|107651007|371879000|107651007
of virus|49872002
shed
when
temperatures|246508008
are
highest.|75540009|371879000

Children|410601007|160499008
are
much more infectious|242762006|4757001
than adults|133936004
and
shed virus|49872002
from just
before
they
develop
symptoms
until two weeks|420797005|258705008
after infection.

The transmission|258150004
of influenza|6142004|396425006
can
be
modeled
mathematically,
which
helps
predict
how
the virus|49872002
will
spread|410677005
in a population.[70]|385436007|389109008

Influenza|6142004|396425006
can
be
spread|410677005
in three main ways|421291004|63161005
:
[71][72]|264699005
by direct transmission|255589003|258150004
(
when
an infected person|125676002
sneezes|162367006
mucus directly|49909006
into the eyes,|81745001
nose|260540009|181195007
or
mouth|74262004|123851003|21082005|181220002
of another person|125676002
)
;
the airborne route|284009009
(
when
someone
inhales|14910006|421134003
the aerosols|64242006|52262001
produced
by an infected person coughing,|125676002|272039006
sneezing|162367006
or
spitting|12405001
)
and
through hand-to-eye,|85562004|81745001|85562004|244486005|302539009|81745001|302539009|244486005
hand-to-nose,|85562004|260540009|85562004|181195007|302539009|260540009|302539009|181195007
or
hand-to-mouth transmission,|85562004|74262004|258150004|85562004|123851003|258150004|85562004|21082005|258150004|85562004|181220002|258150004|302539009|74262004|258150004|302539009|123851003|258150004|302539009|21082005|258150004|302539009|181220002|258150004
either
from contaminated surfaces|62604006|410678000
or
from direct personal contact|255589003|11723008|255589003|70862002
such as a hand-shake.|85562004|26079004|302539009|26079004

The relative importance|125677006|29920004
of these three modes|421291004
of transmission|258150004
is
unclear,
and
they
may
all
contribute
to the
spread|410677005
of the virus.|49872002

In the airborne route,|284009009
the droplets
that
are
small|255507004
enough
for people|125676002
to inhale|421134003
are
0.5|260316000
to 5 ?m|264706000|264605009
in diameter|81827009
and
inhaling just one droplet|14910006|421379005
might
be
enough to
cause|23981006|134198009
an infection.

Although
a single sneeze|125681006|162367006|50607009|162367006
releases|115956009
up to 40,000 droplets,|259031006
[74]
most
of these droplets
are
quite large|255509001
and
will
quickly
settle|128719006
out of the air.|417696007

How long influenza|255511005|6142004|255511005|396425006
survives
in airborne droplets
seems
to
be
influenced
by the levels|258395000
of humidity|3525006
and
UV radiation|41355003
:
with low humidity|44974002
and
a lack|41277001
of sunlight|49926000
in winter aiding|62479008|246088000
its survival.[71]|264699005

As the influenza virus|55014007
can
persist
outside of the body,|279495008|123037004
it
can
also
be
transmitted|60117003|258150004
by contaminated surfaces|62604006|410678000
such as banknotes,
[75] doorknobs,
light switches|56242006|371268001
and
other household items.|74964007

The length|410668003
of time|410669006
the virus|49872002
will
persist
on a surface|410678000
varies
,
with the virus surviving|49872002
for one|421379005
to two days|420797005|258703001
on hard, non-porous surfaces|72505002|410678000
such as plastic|61088005
or
metal,|425620007
for about fifteen minutes|258701004|255507004|356624006
from dry paper tissues,|13880007|50833004|85756007
and
only five minutes|50607009|421820001|258701004|50607009|421820001|255507004|50607009|421820001|356624006|420295001|421820001|258701004|420295001|421820001|255507004|420295001|421820001|356624006
on skin.|119325001|39937001|181469002

However,
if
the virus|49872002
is
present|52101004|246105001
in mucus,|49909006
this
can
protect
it
for longer periods|255511005|259037005
(
up to 17 days|258703001
on banknotes
).

Avian influenza viruses|359829002
can
survive
indefinitely
when
frozen.|48103003|261014004

They
are
inactivated
by heating
to 56 ?C
(133 ?F)|372639009
for a minimum|255605001|255604002
of 60 minutes,|258701004|255507004|356624006
as well as
by acids|34957004
(
at pH <2|27327002|264723009|264724003|264725002|365723003
).[77]

The mechanisms|257544000
by which influenza infection|6142004|396425006
causes|134198009
symptoms
in humans|278412004
have
been
studied|110465008|224699009
intensively.

One|421379005
of the mechanisms|257544000
is
believed to
be
the inhibition|61511001|419495008
of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH)|111153005
resulting|42752001
in lowered cortisol levels.|261122009|62037009|385440003|62037009

Knowing|36692007
which genes|67271001
are
carried|288345009
by a particular strain|48532005|276768000
can
help
predict
how well|20572008
it
will
infect
humans|278412004
and
how severe|24484000
this infection
will
be
(
that
is
,
predict
the strain's pathophysiology.[45][79]|48532005|386585008|276768000|386585008

For instance,
part|260726005
of the process|415178003
that
allows
influenza viruses to|55014007
invade
cells|4421005
is
the cleavage|23365005
of the viral hemagglutinin protein|88878007
by any one|421379005
of several human proteases.|261028005|278412004|130202003|261028005|278412004|116536008

In mild|255604002
and
avirulent viruses,|49872002
the structure
of the hemagglutinin means|255586005
that
it
can
only
be
cleaved|227389000|9094003|58604003
by proteases|130202003|116536008
found|404684003
in the throat|54066008|49928004|264231000
and
lungs,|39607008
so
these viruses|49872002
cannot
infect
other tissues.|74964007|85756007

However,
in highly virulent strains,|75540009|48532005|75540009|276768000
such as H5N1,|55604004
the hemagglutinin
can
be
cleaved|227389000|9094003|58604003
by a wide variety|90522003
of proteases,|130202003|116536008
allowing
the virus to|49872002
spread|410677005
throughout the body.[79]|279495008|123037004

The viral hemagglutinin protein|88878007
is
responsible|394851003
for determining
both
which species a strain|69658003|48532005|69658003|276768000
can
infect
and
where
in the human respiratory tract a strain|278412004|20139000|48532005|278412004|20139000|276768000|278412004|321667001|48532005|278412004|321667001|276768000|278412004|361110005|48532005|278412004|361110005|276768000
of influenza|6142004|396425006
will
bind.|257768005

Strains|48532005|276768000
that
are
easily|36203004
transmitted|60117003|258150004
between people|125676002
have
hemagglutinin proteins|88878007
that
bind|257768005
to receptors|116647005
in the upper part|261183002|260726005
of the respiratory tract,|20139000|321667001|361110005
such as
in the nose,|260540009|181195007
throat|54066008|49928004|264231000
and
mouth.|74262004|123851003|21082005|181220002

In contrast,
the highly lethal H5N1 strain|75540009|55604004|48532005|75540009|55604004|276768000
binds|257768005
to receptors|116647005
that
are
mostly
found|404684003
deep|131197000
in the lungs.|39607008

This difference|263735002
in the site|10546003
of infection
may
be
part|260726005
of the reason|410666004
why
the H5N1 strain|55604004|48532005|55604004|276768000
causes|134198009
severe viral pneumonia|24484000|75570004
in the lungs,|39607008
but
is
not easily|36203004
transmitted|60117003|258150004
by people|125676002
coughing|272039006
and
sneezing.[82][83]|162367006

Common symptoms|72906007
of the flu|6142004
such as fever,|386661006
headaches,|25064002
and
fatigue|84229001
are
the result|394617004
of the huge amounts|107651007
of proinflammatory cytokines|75777003
and
chemokines
(
such as interferon|49327004
or
tumor necrosis factor|8612007
produced
from influenza-infected cells.|6142004|4421005|396425006|4421005

In contrast
to the rhinovirus|90389005
that
causes|134198009
the common cold,|82272006|54150009
influenza|6142004|396425006
does
cause tissue damage,|134198009|37782003
so
symptoms
are
not entirely
due to the inflammatory response.

This massive immune response|46998006|35024006
might
produce
a life-threatening cytokine storm.|224130005|75777003

This effect|253861007
has
been
proposed
to
be
the cause|134198009
of the unusual lethality
of both
the H5N1 avian influenza,|55604004|55604004
[86]
and
the 1918 pandemic strain.|48532005|276768000

However,
another possibility
is
that
these large amounts|255509001|107651007
of cytokines|75777003
are
just
a result|394617004
of the massive levels|46998006|258395000
of viral replication|74256009
produced
by these strains,|48532005|276768000
and
the immune response|35024006
does
not
itself
contribute
to the disease.[89]|64572001

Vaccination
against influenza|6142004|396425006
with an influenza vaccine|396425006
is
often|70232002
recommended
for high-risk groups,|15508007|261586004|15508007|160481000
such as children|410601007|160499008
and
the elderly,|105436006
or
in people|125676002
who
have
asthma,|195967001
diabetes,|73211009
heart disease,|56265001
or
are
immuno-compromised.|370391006

Influenza vaccines|396425006
can
be
produced
in several ways|261028005
;
the most common method|4757001|72906007|260686004|4757001|72906007|272394005
is
to
grow
the virus|49872002
in fertilized hen eggs.|57323001

After purification,
the virus|49872002
is
inactivated
(
for example,
by treatment|276239002|416118004
with detergent|264299001
)
to
produce
an inactivated-virus vaccine.|37362000

Alternatively,
the virus|49872002
can
be
grown
in eggs|102263004
until
it
loses
virulence
and
the avirulent virus|49872002
given|419582001
as a live vaccine.|419749002|398827000

The effectiveness|255403003
of these influenza vaccines|396425006
are
variable.|255372005

Due to the high mutation rate|75540009|55446002|371879000|55446002
of the virus,|49872002
a particular influenza vaccine usually|396425006
confers
protection
for no more|242762006
than a few years.|57176003|258707000

Every year,|258707000|259039008
the World Health Organization|263775005|21139007
predicts
which
strains|48532005|276768000
of the virus|49872002
are
most likely to|4757001|2931005
be
circulating|65929005
in the next year|18769003|258707000|18769003|259039008|255260001|258707000|255260001|259039008
(
see|281004000
Historical annual reformulations|53281000|392521001|53281000
of the influenza vaccine,|396425006

pharmaceutical companies to|421967003
develop
vaccines|398827000

the best immunity|58915005

with culling
in attempts
to eradicate outbreaks.[91]|443684005

It
is
possible to|371930009|60022001
get
vaccinated
and
still
get
influenza.|6142004|396425006

The vaccine|398827000
is
reformulated
each season|21864008
for a few specific flu strains|57176003|69658003|6142004|48532005|57176003|69658003|6142004|276768000
but
cannot
possibly|60022001
include|55919000
all the strains actively infecting people|48532005|125676002|276768000|125676002
in the world
for
that season.|21864008

It
takes|419652001
about six months|422218008|258706009
for the manufacturers to
formulate
and
produce
the millions
of doses|277406006
required
to
deal
with the seasonal epidemics|21864008
;
occasionally,
a new|7147002
or
overlooked strain|48532005|276768000
becomes
prominent|4657009
during
that time|410669006
and
infects
people|125676002
although
they
have
been
vaccinated
(
as
by the H3N2 Fujian flu|303178005|6142004
in the 2003?2004 flu season|6142004|21864008
).

It
is
also possible to|371930009|60022001
get
infected
just
before
vaccination
and
get
sick
with the very|260358002
strain|48532005|276768000
that
the vaccine|398827000
is
supposed to
prevent
,
as
the vaccine|398827000
takes|419652001
about two weeks to|420797005|258705008
become
effective.[93]|255403003|254648000

The 2006?2007 season|21864008
was
the first|255216001|232714002
in which
the CDC
had
recommended
that children|410601007|160499008
younger|84422007
than 59 months|258706009
receive
the annual influenza vaccine.|53281000|396425006

Vaccines|398827000
can
cause|23981006|134198009
the immune system to|116003000
react
as if
the body|279495008|123037004
were
actually
being
infected,
and
general infection symptoms|267022002
(many cold|260396001|285686007|260396001|82272006|260396001|84162001
and
flu symptoms|6142004
are
just general infection symptoms|267022002
)
can
appear
,
though
these symptoms
are
usually
not
as severe|24484000
or
long-lasting|255511005
as influenza.|6142004|396425006

The most dangerous side effect|4757001
is
a severe allergic reaction|24484000|421961002
to
either
the virus material|49872002|260769002|260769002
itself
or
residues|65320000
from the hen eggs|286550009
used|394850002
to
grow
the influenza|6142004|396425006
;
however,
these reactions|263851003
are
extremely rare.[95]|84638005|103356009

The cost-effectiveness|255403003
of seasonal influenza vaccination|21864008|86198006
has
been
widely
evaluated
for different groups|263735002|261586004|263735002|160481000
and
in different settings.|263735002

It
has
generally
been
found|404684003
to
be
a cost-effective intervention,|255403003|225334002|254648000|225334002
especially
in children[96]|410601007|160499008
and
the elderly,|105436006
[97] however|260309001|264708004
the results|394617004
of economic evaluations
of influenza vaccination|86198006
have
often|70232002
been
found|404684003
to
be
dependent|371154000
on key assumptions.[98]

In addition|260364009
to vaccination
against seasonal influenza,|21864008|6142004|21864008|396425006
researchers
are
working|261041009
to
develop
a vaccine|398827000
against a possible influenza|371930009|6142004|371930009|396425006|60022001|6142004|60022001|396425006
pandemic.

The rapid development,|255358001|278923009
production,
and
distribution|255464007
of pandemic influenza vaccines|396425006
could
potentially
save millions
of lives|224130005
during an influenza|6142004|396425006
pandemic.

Due to the short time frame|359530003|7389001|367450005|7389001
between identification|286672002|7882003
of a pandemic strain|48532005|276768000
and
need|410525008|103325001
for vaccination,
researchers
are
looking|386548000
at non-egg-based options|102263004|102263004|418836005|263828003|263828003|418836005
for vaccine production.|398827000

Live|419749002
attenuated|24588000
(egg-based|102263004|102263004|418836005|263828003|263828003|418836005
or
cell-based|4421005|4421005|418836005|362837007|362837007|418836005
)
technology
and
recombinant technologies
(proteins|88878007
and
virus-like particles|66813007
)
could
provide
better "real-time" access|3442003|410669006|260507000
and
be
produced
more affordably,|242762006
thereby
increasing|260369004
access|260507000
for people|125676002
living|224130005|419749002
in low-|62482003|371880002
and
moderate-|6736007
income countries,|223369002
where
an influenza pandemic|6142004|396425006
may
likely|2931005
originate.

As of July 2009,
more
than 70 known clinical trials|36692007|110465008
have
been
completed|255594003
or
are
ongoing|255238004
for pandemic influenza vaccines.|396425006

In September 2009,
the
US Food and Drug Administration|255620007|18629005
approved|9571008
four vaccines|421534005|398827000
against the 2009 H1N1 influenza virus|442352004|6142004|442352004|396425006|442696006|49872002|442696006|303175008|55014007
(
the current pandemic strain|15240007|48532005|15240007|276768000
)
,
and
expect
the initial vaccine|884001|398827000|232714002|398827000
lots
to
be
available|103328004
within the following month.[100]|255260001|258706009|255260001|259036001

In 2011,
there
was
some
research
success|385669000
towards a "universal flu vaccine"|73548004|396425006
that
produces
antibodies|68498002
against proteins|88878007
on the viral coat|228224007
which
mutate|55446002
less rapidly,|276139006|418694008|263796003|418694008
and
thus
a single shot|125681006|28289002|50607009|28289002
could
potentially
provide
longer-lasting protection.[101][102]|255511005

Reasonably effective ways to|255403003|254648000
reduce|260400001
the transmission|258150004
of influenza|6142004|396425006
include|55919000
good personal health|405153007
and
hygiene habits|284779002|90275003
such as
:
not
touching|52962008
your eyes,|81745001
nose|260540009|181195007
or
mouth|74262004|123851003|21082005|181220002
;[103] frequent|70232002
hand washing|258154008
(
with soap|25780000
and
water,|11713004|119318008
or
with alcohol-based hand rubs|414547000|85562004|414547000|302539009|414547000|418836005|85562004|414547000|418836005|302539009
)
;[104] covering coughs|255334000|272039006|255334000|289114008
and
sneezes|162367006
;
avoiding
close contact|29179001|11723008|29179001|70862002
with sick people|125676002
;
and
staying home|261770009
yourself
if
you
are
sick.

Avoiding spitting|12405001
is
also
recommended.

Although
face masks|261382003
might
help
prevent
transmission|258150004
when
caring
for the sick,
[106][107] there
is
mixed evidence|26242008|18669006
on beneficial effects|253861007
in the community.|133928008

Smoking|365981007
raises|260399008
the risk|30207005
of contracting influenza,|78558002|6142004|78558002|396425006
as well as
producing more severe disease symptoms.[109][110]|162470006|64572001

Since
influenza|6142004|396425006
spreads|410677005
through
both
aerosols|64242006|52262001
and
contact|11723008|70862002
with contaminated surfaces,|62604006|410678000
surface sanitizing|410678000
may
help
prevent
some infections.

Alcohol|419442005|53041004|430837008
is
an effective sanitizer|255403003|254648000
against influenza viruses,|55014007
while
quaternary ammonium compounds|301712000
can
be
used|394850002
with alcohol|419442005|53041004|430837008
so
that
the sanitizing effect lasts|253861007
for longer.|255511005

In hospitals,
quaternary ammonium compounds|301712000
and
bleach|76885009
are
used|394850002
to
sanitize
rooms
or
equipment|246137000
that
have
been
occupied
by patients|116154003
with influenza symptoms.|6142004|396425006

At home,|261770009
this
can
be
done
effectively
with a diluted chlorine bleach.[113]|421399004|29276003|76885009|421399004|76885009

During past pandemics,|410513005
closing|29179001
schools,|257698009
churches|284453007
and
theaters|257715004
slowed|419443000
the
spread|410677005
of the virus|49872002
but
did
not
have
a large effect|255509001|253861007
on the overall death rate.|409651001

It
is
uncertain|64957009
if
reducing|260400001
public gatherings,
by
for example closing schools|29179001|257698009
and
workplaces,|285141008
will
reduce|260400001
transmission|258150004
since
people|125676002
with influenza|6142004|396425006
may
just
be
moved|384598002|370125004
from one area|421379005|42798000
to another
;
such measures|246445000|367346004
would
also
be
difficult|52925006
to enforce
and
might
be
unpopular.

When
small numbers|255507004|410680006|255507004|410681005
of people|125676002
are
infected
,
isolating|46651001
the sick
might
reduce|260400001
the risk|30207005
of transmission.[105]|258150004

People|125676002
with the flu|6142004
are
advised|424900004
to
get
plenty
of rest,|258157001
drink plenty|226465004
of liquids,|33463005
avoid
using|260676000
alcohol|419442005|53041004|430837008
and
tobacco|39953003|12572000|57264008
and
,
if
necessary,
take|419652001
medications|410942007
such as acetaminophen|387517004
(paracetamol to|387517004
relieve|397855004
the fever|386661006
and
muscle aches|68962001
associated|47429007
with the flu.|6142004

Children|410601007|160499008
and
teenagers|133937008
with flu symptoms|6142004
(particularly fever|386661006
)
should
avoid
taking|419652001
aspirin|387458008
during an influenza infection|6142004|396425006
(especially influenza type B,|6142004|261664005|396425006|261664005
because
doing
so|223528007
can
lead|88488004
to Reye's syndrome,|74351001
a rare|84638005|103356009
but
potentially fatal disease|399166001|64572001
of the liver.|10200004|181268008

Since
influenza|6142004|396425006
is
caused|23981006|134198009
by a virus,|49872002
antibiotics|255631004
have
no effect|253861007
on the infection
;
unless
prescribed
for secondary infections|264569006
such as bacterial pneumonia.|53084003

Antiviral medication|372701006|410942007
may
be
effective,|255403003|254648000
but
some
strains|48532005|276768000
of influenza|6142004|396425006
can
show
resistance|30714006
to the standard antiviral drugs|372701006
and
there
is
concern
about the quality|263496004
of the research.[118]

The two classes|420797005|258391009
of antiviral drugs|372701006
used|394850002
against influenza|6142004|396425006
are
neuraminidase inhibitors|409228005
(oseltamivir|412261005
and
zanamivir|387010007
and
M2 protein inhibitors|278077005|88878007|61511001
(adamantane derivatives
).

Neuraminidase inhibitors|409228005
are
currently|15240007
preferred|225773000
for flu virus infections|6142004|34014006
since
they
are
less toxic|276139006|263796003
and
possibly more effective.|60022001|255403003|60022001|254648000

In 2009,
the World Health Organization|263775005|21139007
recommended
that persons|125676002
in high risk groups,|15508007|261586004|15508007|160481000
including|55919000
pregnant women,|255409004
children|410601007|160499008
under two,|420797005
and
persons|125676002
with respiratory problems,|258162000|55607006|449071006|55607006
begin|255395001
taking antivirals|419652001|372701006
as soon
as they
start|255395001
experiencing
flu symptoms.|6142004

However,
their effectiveness|255403003
is
controversial.[19]

Neuraminidase inhibitors|409228005
include|55919000
the antiviral medications oseltamivir|372701006|410942007|412261005
(Tamiflu
)
and
zanamivir|387010007
(Relenza
).

These medications|410942007
may
be
effective|255403003|254648000
against
both
influenza A|6142004|396425006
and
B[122] however
the confidence|225487001
of the research community|133928008
in this conclusion
is
low|62482003|371880002
as
much
of the trial data remains|110465008
unpublished.

Different strains|263735002|48532005|263735002|276768000
of influenza viruses|55014007
have
differing degrees|246173007
of resistance|30714006
against these antivirals,|372701006
and
it
is
impossible to
predict
what degree|258395000|246173007
of resistance|30714006
a future pandemic strain|48532005|276768000
might
have.

The FDA
deems
their effect to|253861007
be
modest.[19]

The antiviral drugs amantadine|372701006|372763006
and
rimantadine|372532009
block|26036001|112232007
a viral ion channel|48006008|255592004
(M2 protein|278077005|88878007
and
prevent
the virus|49872002
from infecting cells.|4421005

These drugs|410942007
are
sometimes
effective|255403003|254648000
against influenza A|6142004|396425006
if
given|419582001
early|264499004
in the infection
but
are
always ineffective
against influenza B|6142004|396425006
because
B viruses|112383009
do
not
possess
M2 molecules.|278077005|290005005

Measured resistance to|258104002|30714006
amantadine|372763006
and
rimantadine|372532009
in American isolates|46651001
of H3N2|303178005
has
increased|35105006|260366006
to 91%
in 2005.

This high level|75540009|258395000|75540009|276625007|371879000|258395000|371879000|276625007
of resistance|30714006
may
be
due to the easy availability|36203004|103328004
of amantadines
as part|260726005

recommended
against

in about
one|421379005

from influenza.[133]|6142004|396425006

According to the World Health Organization|263775005|21139007
:
"
Every winter,
tens
of millions
of people|125676002
get
the flu.|6142004

Most
are
only ill|50607009|367391008|420295001|367391008
and
out of work|261041009
for a week,|258705008|259038000
yet
the elderly|105436006
are
at a higher risk|15508007
of death|419620001|268923008
from the illness.|39104002

We
know|36692007
the worldwide death toll|419620001|268923008
exceeds
a few hundred thousand people|57176003|125676002
a year,|258707000|259039008
but
even
in developed countries|223369002
the numbers|410680006|410681005
are
uncertain,|64957009
because
medical authorities|74188005
don't
usually
verify
who actually
died|419620001|419099009
of influenza|6142004|396425006
and
who
died|419620001|419099009
of a flu-like illness."[134] Even healthy people|95891005|263775005|125676002
can
be
affected|247591002|248448006
,
and
serious problems|42745003|55607006
from influenza|6142004|396425006
can
happen
at any age.|424144002

People|125676002
over 50 years old,|258707000|70753007
very young children|260358002|84422007|410601007|260358002|84422007|160499008
and
people|125676002
of any age|424144002
with chronic medical conditions|90734009|74188005|78326006|90734009|74188005|260905004
are
more likely to|242762006|2931005
get
complications|116223007
from influenza,|6142004|396425006
such as pneumonia,|205237003
bronchitis,|32398004
sinus,|428794004|2095001
and
ear infections.[93]|129127001

In some cases,|398241000|413769002
an autoimmune response|263680009
to an influenza infection|6142004|396425006
may
contribute
to the development|278923009
of Guillain-Barr? syndrome.

However,
as
many other infections|74964007
can
increase|260366006
the risk|30207005
of this disease,|64572001
influenza|6142004|396425006
may
only
be
an important cause|134198009
during epidemics.

This syndrome
has
been
believed
to also
be
a rare side effect|84638005|103356009
of influenza vaccines.|396425006

One review|421379005
gives|419582001
an incidence
of about one case|421379005|398241000
per million vaccinations.

Getting
infected
by influenza|6142004|396425006
itself
increases|260366006
both
the risk|30207005
of death|419620001|268923008
(
up to 1|260305007
in 10,000
)
and
increases|260366006
the risk|30207005
of developing GBS|64734009
to a much higher level|242762006|75540009|258395000|242762006|75540009|276625007|242762006|371879000|258395000|242762006|371879000|276625007|4757001|75540009|258395000|4757001|75540009|276625007|4757001|371879000|258395000|4757001|371879000|276625007
than the highest level|75540009|258395000|75540009|276625007|371879000|258395000|371879000|276625007
of suspected vaccine involvement|398827000|248448006|415684004|398827000|248448006
(approx.

10 times|410669006|417929005
higher|75540009|371879000
by recent estimates|6493001|414135002
).[138][139]

Influenza|6142004|396425006
reaches|282679008
peak prevalence|255587001
in winter,
and
because
the Northern
and
Southern Hemispheres
have
winter
at different times|263735002|410669006|263735002|417929005
of the year,|258707000|259039008
there
are
actually
two|420797005
different flu|263735002|6142004
seasons|227553009
each year.|258707000|259039008

This
is
why
the World Health Organization|263775005|21139007
(
assisted|371152001
by the National Influenza Centers|6142004|26216008|396425006|26216008
makes
recommendations
for two different vaccine formulations|420797005|263735002|398827000
every year|258707000|259039008
;
one|421379005
for the Northern,
and
one|421379005
for the Southern Hemisphere.[90]|264705001|264703008

A long-standing puzzle|255511005|10904000
has
been
why outbreaks|443684005
of the flu|6142004
occur|272120004
seasonally
rather than
uniformly
throughout the year.|258707000|259039008

One possible explanation|421379005|371930009|421379005|60022001
is
that,
because
people|125676002
are
indoors more often|70232002
during the winter,
they
are
in close contact more often,|29179001|11723008|70232002|29179001|70862002|70232002
and
this
promotes
transmission|258150004
from person|125676002
to person.|125676002

Increased travel|35105006|420008001|260366006|420008001
due to the Northern Hemisphere winter holiday season|21864008
may
also
play|300776002
a role.

Another factor
is
that cold temperatures|285686007
lead|88488004
to drier air,|417696007
which
may
dehydrate|34095006
mucus,|49909006
preventing|116699007
the body|279495008|123037004
from effectively expelling virus particles.|285296008

The virus also|49872002
survives
longer|255511005
on surfaces|410678000
at colder temperatures|285686007
and
aerosol transmission|64242006|258150004|52262001|258150004
of the virus|49872002
is
highest|75540009|371879000
in cold environments|285123000
(less
than 5 ?C|264706000|264605009
)
with low relative humidity.|44974002|125677006|44974002|29920004|62482003|250829009|371880002|250829009

Indeed,
the lower air humidity|261122009|417696007|3525006
in winter
seems
to
be
the main cause|63161005|134198009
of seasonal influenza transmission|21864008|6142004|258150004|21864008|396425006|258150004
in temperate regions.[142][143]|410673009

However,
seasonal changes|21864008|243326001|21864008|263703002
in infection rates also
occur|272120004
in tropical regions,|410673009
and
in some countries|223369002
these peaks|255587001
of infection
are
seen
mainly
during the rainy season.|21864008

Seasonal changes in contact rates|21864008|243326001|11723008|21864008|243326001|70862002|21864008|263703002|11723008|21864008|263703002|70862002
from school terms,|257698009
which
are
a major factor|255603008
in other childhood diseases|74964007|68433009|64572001
such as measles|14189004
and
pertussis,|27836007
may
also
play|300776002
a role
in the flu.|6142004

A combination|89780004
of these small seasonal effects|255507004|21864008|253861007
may
be
amplified
by dynamical resonance|39527002|33679000|300594005
with the endogenous disease cycles.|73979006|64572001|44180009

H5N1|55604004
exhibits
seasonality|21864008
in
both
humans|278412004
and
birds.[146]|387972009

An alternative hypothesis to
explain
seasonality|21864008
in influenza infections|6142004|396425006
is
an effect|253861007
of vitamin D levels|71516007|258395000|30178006|258395000
on immunity|58915005
to the virus.|49872002

This idea|363878000
was
first|255216001|232714002
proposed
by Robert Edgar Hope-Simpson|247798006
in 1965.

He
proposed
that
the cause|134198009
of influenza epidemics|6142004|396425006
during winter
may
be
connected
to seasonal fluctuations|21864008|16237004
of vitamin D,|71516007|30178006
which
is
produced
in the skin|119325001|39937001|181469002
under the influence
of solar|49926000
(
or
artificial|71967004
)
UV radiation.|41355003

This
could
explain
why influenza|6142004|396425006
occurs|272120004
mostly
in winter
and
during the tropical rainy season,|21864008
when
people|125676002
stay
indoors,
away
from the sun,|49926000
and
their vitamin D levels|71516007|258395000|30178006|258395000
fall.|1912002

As influenza|6142004|396425006
is
caused|23981006|134198009
by a variety
of species|69658003
and
strains|48532005|276768000
of viruses,|49872002
in any given year|258707000|259039008
some
strains|48532005|276768000
can
die|419620001|399069006|419099009
out
while
others|74964007
create
epidemics,
while
yet
another strain|48532005|276768000
can
cause|23981006|134198009
a pandemic.

Typically,
in a year's normal two flu seasons|258707000|17621005|420797005|6142004|21864008|258707000|258744000|420797005|6142004|21864008|259039008|17621005|420797005|6142004|21864008|259039008|258744000|420797005|6142004|21864008
(one|421379005
per hemisphere
)
,
there
are
between three|421291004
and
five million cases|421820001|398241000|421820001|413769002
of severe illness|24484000|39104002
and
up to 500,000 deaths worldwide,|419620001|268923008
which
by some definitions
is
a yearly influenza|53281000|6142004|53281000|396425006
epidemic.

Although
the incidence
of influenza|6142004|396425006
can
vary
widely
between years,|258707000
approximately 36,000 deaths|26175008|419620001|26175008|268923008
and
more
than 200,000 hospitalizations|394656005
are
directly
associated|47429007
with influenza|6142004|396425006
every year|258707000|259039008
in the United States.|223688001

On average 41,400 people|125676002
died|419620001|419099009
each year|258707000|259039008
in the United States|223688001
between 1979
and
2001
from influenza.|6142004|396425006

In 2010
the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|26216008|64572001|31509003|169443000
(CDC
)
in the United States|223688001
changed|243326001|263703002
the way
it
reports|229059009|223458004
the 30 year|258707000|259039008
estimates|414135002
for deaths.|419620001|268923008

Now
they
are
reported|229059009|223458004
as a range
from a low|62482003|371880002
of about 3,300 deaths|419620001|268923008
to a high|75540009|371879000
of 49,000
per year.[153]|258707000|259039008

Roughly three times|421291004|410669006|421291004|417929005
per century,
a pandemic
occurs|272120004
,
which
infects
a large proportion|255509001|8212001
of the world's population|385436007|389109008
and
can
kill|248007002
tens
of millions
of people|125676002
(
see|281004000
pandemics section.|62083003|118630004

One study|421379005|110465008|421379005|224699009
estimated|414135002
that
if
a strain|48532005|276768000
with similar virulence
to the 1918 influenza|6142004|396425006
emerged
today,
it
could
kill|248007002
between 50
and
80 million people.[154]|125676002

New influenza viruses|7147002|55014007
are
constantly
evolving|59381007
by mutation|55446002
or
by reassortment.

Mutations|55446002
can
cause|23981006|134198009
small changes|255507004|243326001|255507004|263703002
in the hemagglutinin
and
neuraminidase antigens|80837006|7120007
on the surface|410678000
of the virus.|49872002

This
is
called antigenic drift,|7120007
which slowly|419443000
creates
an increasing variety|260369004
of strains|48532005|276768000
until one|421379005
evolves|59381007
that
can
infect
people|125676002
who
are
immune|255386009
to the pre-existing strains.|236874000|48532005|236874000|276768000|272113006|48532005|272113006|276768000

This new variant then|7147002|40885006
replaces|282089006|370124000
the older strains|70753007|48532005|70753007|276768000
as
it rapidly|418694008
sweeps
through the human population,|278412004|385436007|278412004|389109008
often|70232002
causing|23981006
an epidemic.

However,
since
the strains|48532005|276768000
produced
by drift
will
still
be
reasonably similar
to the older strains,|70753007|48532005|70753007|276768000
some people|125676002
will
still
be
immune|255386009
to them.

In contrast,
when
influenza viruses|55014007
reassort
,
they
acquire|255396000
completely new antigens?|7147002|7120007
for example
by reassortment
between avian strains|387972009|48532005|387972009|276768000
and
human strains|278412004|48532005|278412004|276768000
;
this
is
called antigenic shift.|7120007|9546005

If
a human influenza virus|42334003|6142004|42334003|396425006|6142004|49872002|6142004|278412004|55014007
is
produced
that
has
entirely new antigens,|7147002|7120007
everybody
will
be
susceptible,|131196009
and
the novel influenza|7147002|6142004|7147002|396425006
will
spread|410677005
uncontrollably,
causing|23981006
a pandemic.

In contrast
to this model
of pandemics
based|418836005
on antigenic drift|7120007
and
shift,|9546005
an alternative approach
has
been
proposed
where the periodic pandemics|81591007
are
produced
by interactions
of a fixed set|102491009|261010008
of viral strains|48532005|276768000
with a human population|278412004|385436007|278412004|389109008
with a constantly
changing|243326001|263703002
set
of immunities|58915005
to different viral strains.[157]|263735002|48532005|263735002|276768000

From a public health point|310115006
of view,|246516004
flu epidemics|6142004
spread|410677005
rapidly|418694008
and
are
very difficult to|260358002|52925006
control.|31509003

Most influenza virus strains|55014007|48532005|55014007|276768000
are
not very infectious|260358002
and
each infected individual|125676002|385435006
will
only
go
on to
infect
one|421379005
or
two other individuals|420797005|125676002|420797005|385435006
(
the basic reproduction number|263767004|410680006|263767004|410681005|418836005|263767004|410680006|418836005|263767004|410681005
for influenza|6142004|396425006
is
generally
around 1.4|260305007
).

However,
the generation time|410669006
for influenza|6142004|396425006
is
extremely short|359530003|367450005
:
the time|410669006
from a person|125676002
becoming
infected
to
when
he
infects
the next person|18769003|125676002|255260001|125676002
is
only two days.|50607009|420797005|258703001|420295001|420797005|258703001

The short generation time means|359530003|410669006|255586005|367450005|410669006|255586005
that influenza epidemics|6142004|396425006
generally peak|255587001
at
around 2 months|260306008|258706009
and
burn out|58535001
after 3 months_[clarification|260313008|258706009
needed|410525008|103325001
_]
:
the decision
to intervene
in an influenza epidemic therefore|6142004|396425006
has
to
be
taken|419652001
early,|264499004
and
the decision
is
therefore often|70232002
made
on the back of incomplete data.|255551008|255599008|255551008|255609007

Another problem|55607006
is
that individuals|125676002|385435006
become
infectious
before
they
become
symptomatic,|264931009
which means|255586005
that putting people|125676002
in quarantine|170499009
after
they
become
ill|367391008
is
not
an effective public health intervention.|255403003|310115006|225334002|254648000|310115006|225334002

For the average person,|125676002
viral shedding
tends
to peak|255587001
on day two|258703001|420797005|259032004|420797005
whereas
symptoms peak|255587001
on day three.[22]|258703001|421291004|259032004|421291004

The word _Influenza_|255373000|6142004|255373000|396425006
comes
from the Italian language meaning "|297502002
influence
"
and
refers|439980006
to the cause|134198009
of the disease|64572001
;
initially,|884001
this ascribed illness|39104002
to unfavorable astrological influences.

Changes|243326001|263703002
in medical thought|74188005|88952004
led|88488004|236874000
to its modification|243326001
to _influenza del freddo_,|6142004|396425006
meaning|255586005
"influence
of the cold".|285686007|82272006|84162001

The word _influenza_|255373000|6142004|255373000|396425006
was
first|255216001|232714002
used|394850002
in English to|297487008|25804004
refer|439980006
to the disease|64572001
we
know|36692007
today
in 1703
by J.

Hugger
of the University of Edinburgh|224871002
in his thesis _
De Catarrho epidemio,

prout
in India occidentali sese ostendit_.|223600005

Archaic terms
for influenza|6142004|396425006
include|55919000
_epidemic catarrh_,
_grippe_|6142004
(
from the French,|19434008
first
used|394850002
by Molyneaux
in 1694 [161]
)
,
_sweating sickness_,|161857006|39104002
and
_Spanish fever_|386661006
(particularly
for the 1918 flu pandemic strain|6142004|48532005|6142004|276768000
).[162]

The symptoms
of human influenza|6142004
were
clearly
described
by Hippocrates roughly 2,400 years ago.|258707000

Although
the virus|49872002
seems
to
have
caused epidemics|23981006|134198009
throughout human history,|278412004|278412004|392521001
historical data|392521001
on influenza|6142004|396425006
are
difficult to|52925006
interpret|363714003
,
because
the symptoms
can
be
similar
to those
of other respiratory diseases.|74964007|50043002

The disease|64572001
may
have
spread|410677005
from Europe|223502009
to the Americas
as early|264499004
as the European colonization|414152003
of the Americas
;
since
almost the entire indigenous population|255503000|385436007|255503000|389109008|260232004|385436007|260232004|389109008
of the Antilles
was
killed|248007002
by an epidemic resembling influenza|6142004|396425006
that broke out
in 1493,
after
the arrival
of Christopher Columbus.[168][169]

The first convincing record|255216001|232714002
of an influenza pandemic|6142004|396425006
was
of an outbreak|443684005
in 1580,
which
began|255395001
in Russia|223656009
and
spread|410677005
to Europe|223502009
via Africa.|223498002

In Rome,
over 8,000 people|21481007|125676002
were
killed|248007002
,
and
several Spanish cities|261028005|284560003
were
almost
wiped
out.|255529000

Pandemics
continued|255238004
sporadically
throughout the 17th
and
18th centuries,
with the pandemic
of 1830?1833
being
particularly widespread|85333001
;
it
infected approximately|26175008
a quarter
of the people|125676002
exposed.[167]|24932003

The most famous|4757001
and
lethal outbreak|443684005
was
the 1918 flu|6142004
pandemic
(Spanish flu pandemic|6142004
)
(type A influenza,|261664005|6142004|261664005|396425006
H1N1 subtype|303175008|260837004
)
,
which
lasted
from 1918
to 1919.

It
is
not
known|36692007
exactly
how
many it
killed,|248007002
but
estimates|414135002
range
from 50
to 100 million people.|125676002

This pandemic
has
been
described
as "
the greatest medical holocaust|4757001|74188005
in history"|392521001
and
may
have
killed|248007002
as many people|125676002
as the Black Death.|9012003|50797007

This huge death toll|419620001|268923008
was
caused|23981006|134198009
by an extremely high infection rate|75540009|371879000
of
up to 50%
and
the extreme severity|12565001|272141005
of the symptoms,
suspected|415684004
to
be
caused|23981006|134198009
by cytokine storms.|75777003

Indeed,
symptoms
in 1918
were
so unusual|223528007
that initially influenza|884001|6142004|884001|396425006
was
misdiagnosed
as dengue,|38362002
cholera,|63650001
or
typhoid.|4834000|396441007

One observer wrote,|421379005|12261009
"One|421379005
of the most|4757001
striking|89098005
of the complications|116223007
was
hemorrhage|131148009
from mucous membranes,|313268005
especially
from the nose,|260540009|181195007
stomach,|69695003|181246003
and
intestine.|261093006

Bleeding|131148009
from the ears|117590005|1910005
and
petechial hemorrhages|423716004
in the skin also|119325001|39937001|181469002
occurred."[171]|272120004
The majority
of deaths|419620001|268923008
were
from bacterial pneumonia,|53084003
a secondary infection|264569006
caused|23981006|134198009
by influenza,|6142004|396425006
but
the virus also killed people directly,|49872002|248007002|125676002|248007002|125676002
causing|23981006
massive hemorrhages|112648003
and
edema|423666004
in the lung.[173]|39607008|181216001

The 1918 flu|6142004
pandemic
(Spanish flu pandemic|6142004
)
was
truly global,|60132005
spreading|410677005
even
to the Arctic
and
remote Pacific islands.|5686001|288560006|261007001|288560006

The unusually severe disease|24484000|64572001
killed|248007002
between 2|260306008
and
20%
of those infected,
as
opposed
to the more usual flu epidemic mortality rate|242762006|6142004|409651001
of 0.1%.

Another unusual feature
of this pandemic
was
that
it mostly
killed|248007002
young adults,|84422007|133936004
with 99%
of pandemic influenza deaths|6142004|419620001|6142004|268923008|396425006|419620001|396425006|268923008
occurring|272120004
in people|125676002
under 65,|264695004
and
more
than half
in young adults 20|84422007|133936004
to 40 years old.|259031006|258707000|70753007

This
is
unusual
since
influenza|6142004|396425006
is
normally most deadly
to the very young|260358002|84422007
(under age 2|261089000|424144002
)
and
the very old|260358002|70753007
(
over age 70|424144002
).

The total mortality|258755000|409651001|255619001|409651001
of the 1918?1919 pandemic
is
not
known|36692007
,
but
it
is
estimated|414135002
that 2.5%|264655001
to 5%|264706000|264605009
of the world's population|385436007|389109008
was
killed.|248007002

As many|260396001
as 25 million
may
have
been
killed|248007002
in the first 25 weeks|255216001|258705008|232714002|258705008
;
in contrast,
HIV/AIDS|19030005|62479008|86406008|62479008|402916007|62479008
has
killed|248007002
25 million
in its first 25 years.[171]|255216001|258707000|232714002|258707000

Later flu pandemics|6142004
were
not so devastating.

They
included|55919000
the 1957 Asian Flu|414978006|6142004
(type A,|261664005
H2N2 strain|303176009|48532005|303176009|276768000
)
and
the 1968 Hong Kong Flu|223382005|6142004
(type A,|261664005
H3N2 strain|303178005|48532005|303178005|276768000
)
,
but
even
these smaller outbreaks|263796003|443684005|255507004|443684005
killed|248007002
millions
of people.|125676002

In later pandemics antibiotics|260383002|255631004
were
available to|103328004
control|31509003
secondary infections|264569006
and
this
may
have
helped
reduce|260400001
mortality|409651001
compared
to the Spanish Flu|6142004
of 1918.[163]

The first influenza virus to|255216001|55014007|232714002|55014007
be
isolated|46651001
was
from poultry,|359839008|28230009
when
in 1901
the agent|260872001
causing|23981006
a disease called "fowl plague"|64572001|55604004
was
passed
through Chamberland filters,|116250002
which
have
pores
that
are
too small|255507004
for bacteria to|409822003
pass
through.

The etiological cause|134198009|134198009
of influenza,|6142004|396425006
the Orthomyxoviridae family|55014007|35359004
of viruses,|49872002
was
first|255216001|232714002
discovered
in pigs|106996007|78678003
by Richard Shope
in 1931.

This discovery
was
shortly
followed|367409002
by the isolation|40174006|46651001
of the virus|49872002
from humans|278412004
by a group|261586004|160481000|389109008
headed|69536005|302548004
by Patrick Laidlaw
at the Medical Research Council|74188005
of the United Kingdom|223860005
in 1933.

However,
it
was
not
until
Wendell Stanley first crystallized tobacco mosaic virus|255216001|264297004|39953003|255432000|49872002|255216001|264297004|39953003|255432000|255216001|264297004|12572000|255432000|49872002|255216001|264297004|12572000|255432000|255216001|264297004|57264008|255432000|49872002|255216001|264297004|57264008|255432000|232714002|264297004|39953003|255432000|49872002|232714002|264297004|39953003|255432000|232714002|264297004|12572000|255432000|49872002|232714002|264297004|12572000|255432000|232714002|264297004|57264008|255432000|49872002|232714002|264297004|57264008|255432000
in 1935
that
the non-cellular nature|4421005|277302009
of viruses|49872002

appreciated.

The first significant step|255216001|386134007|398298007|232714002|386134007|398298007
towards preventing influenza|6142004|396425006|116699007|6142004|116699007|396425006
was
the development|278923009
in 1944
of a killed-virus vaccine|248007002|37362000
for influenza|6142004|396425006
by Thomas Francis,
Jr..

This
built
on work|261041009
by Australian Frank Macfarlane Burnet,
who
showed
that
the virus|49872002
lost
virulence
when
it
was
cultured|252398009|61594008
in fertilized hen's eggs.|57323001

Application|410618006
of this observation|103705002
by Francis
allowed
his group|261586004|160481000|389109008
of researchers
at the University of Michigan to|224871002|224067004
develop
the first influenza vaccine,|255216001|396425006|232714002|396425006
with support|9096001|243114000
from the [U.S.|223688001

Army]
(/wiki/United_States_Army|223688001
).

The Army
was
deeply
involved|248448006
in this research
due to its experience
of influenza|6142004|396425006
in World War I,|42146005|22971001
when
thousands
of troops
were
killed|248007002
by the virus|49872002
in a matter
of months.|258706009

In comparison
to vaccines,|398827000
the development|278923009
of anti-influenza drugs|6142004|410942007|396425006|410942007
has
been
slower,|419443000
with amantadine|372763006
being
licensed
in 1966
and
,
almost thirty years later,|258707000
the next class|18769003|258391009|255260001|258391009
of drugs|410942007
(
the neuraminidase inhibitors|409228005
being
developed.[56]

Influenza|6142004|396425006
produces
direct costs|255589003
due to lost productivity
and
associated medical treatment,|47429007|74188005|276239002|47429007|74188005|416118004
as well as
indirect costs|255541007
of preventative measures.|246445000|367346004

In the United States,|223688001
influenza|6142004|396425006
is
responsible|394851003
for a total cost|258755000|255619001
of over $10 billion|21481007
per year,|258707000|259039008
while
it
has
been
estimated|414135002
that
a future pandemic
could
cause|23981006|134198009
hundreds
of billions
of dollars|284175004
in direct|255589003
and
indirect costs.|255541007

However,
the economic impacts|134293005
of past pandemics|410513005
have
not
been
intensively
studied|110465008|224699009
,
and
some authors|308004006
have
suggested
that
the Spanish influenza actually|6142004|396425006
had
a positive long-term effect|258758003|253861007|10828004|253861007
on
per-capita income growth,|69536005
despite
a large reduction|255509001|58294000|255509001|260400001|255509001|289928003
in the working population|261041009|385436007|261041009|389109008
and
severe short-term depressive effects.|24484000|253861007

Other studies|74964007|110465008|74964007|224699009
have
attempted
to
predict
the costs
of a pandemic
as serious|42745003
as the 1918 Spanish flu|6142004
on the [U.S.|223688001

economy]
(/wiki/Economy_
of_
the_United_States|223688001
)
,
where 30%
of all workers|106541005
became
ill,|367391008
and
2.5%|264655001
were
killed.|248007002

A 30% sickness rate|39104002
and
a three-week length|421291004|258705008|410668003|421291004|259038000|410668003
of illness|39104002
would
decrease|260400001|260370003
the gross domestic product|255344003|261770009
by 5%.|264706000|264605009

Additional costs|260364009
would
come
from medical treatment|74188005|276239002|74188005|416118004
of 18 million
to 45 million people,|125676002
and
total economic costs|258755000|255619001
would
be
approximately $700 billion.[187]|26175008

Preventative costs
are
also high.|75540009|371879000

Governments worldwide
have
spent billions
of [U.S.|223688001

dollars]|284175004
(/wiki/United_States_dollar|223688001|284175004

preparing
and
planning|312011006|397943006
for a potential H5N1 avian influenza|30207005|55604004|55604004
pandemic,
with costs
associated|47429007
with purchasing drugs|410942007
and
vaccines|398827000
as well as
developing disaster drills|389183007

for improved border controls.|385425000|112233002|31509003|3442003|112233002|31509003

On 1 November 2005,|260305007
United States President [George W.|223688001

Bush]|112591004
(/wiki/George_W._Bush|112591004
)
unveiled
the National Strategy
to Safeguard
Against the Danger
of Pandemic Influenza[189]|6142004|396425006
backed|123961009|255551008|281213008|302552004|77568009
by a request|103320006|385644000
to Congress
for $7.1 billion to
begin|255395001
implementing
the plan.|52713000|397943006

Internationally,
on 18 January 2006,
donor nations|105468003
pledged
US$2 billion to|260306008
combat
bird flu|55604004
at the two-day International Pledging Conference|420797005|258703001|420797005|259032004
on Avian|387972009
and
Human Influenza|6142004
held|421139008
in China.[191]|223581004

In an assessment|386053000
of the 2009 H1N1|303175008
pandemic
on selected countries|223369002
in the Southern Hemisphere,
data
suggest
that
all countries|223369002
experienced
some time-limited|410669006|255469002
and/or
geographically isolated socio/economic effects|46651001|253861007
and
a temporary decrease|14803004|260400001|14803004|260370003
in tourism most likely|2931005
due to fear|1402001
of 2009 H1N1 disease.|303175008|64572001

It
is
still too early to|264499004
determine
whether
the H1N1 pandemic|303175008
has
caused|23981006|134198009
any long-term economic impacts.[192]|134293005

Research
on influenza|6142004|396425006
includes|55919000
studies|110465008|224699009
on molecular virology,|290005005|76018003
how
the virus|49872002
produces
disease|64572001
(pathogenesis,|303109001
host
immune responses,|35024006
viral genomics,
and
how
the virus spreads|49872002|410677005|410677005
(epidemiology.

These studies|110465008|224699009
help
in developing influenza countermeasures|6142004|396425006
;
for example,
a better understanding|3442003|66216009
of the body's immune system response|279495008|35024006|246333005|123037004|35024006|246333005
helps
vaccine development,|398827000|278923009
and
a detailed picture|257444003|257445002
of
how influenza|6142004|396425006
invades
cells|4421005
aids|62479008
the development|278923009
of antiviral drugs.|372701006

One important basic research program|421379005|421379005|418836005
is
the Influenza Genome Sequencing Project,|6142004|18470003|72633008|396425006|18470003|72633008
which
is
creating
a library|264366000
of influenza sequences|6142004|72633008|396425006|72633008
;
this library|264366000
should
help
clarify
which factors
make
one|421379005
strain|48532005|276768000
more lethal|242762006
than another,
which genes|67271001
most
affect|4065008
immunogenicity,|7120007|58915005
and
how
the virus|49872002
evolves|59381007
over time.[193]|410669006

Research
into new vaccines|7147002|398827000
is
particularly important,
as
current vaccines|15240007|398827000
are
very slow|263926003
and
expensive to
produce
and
must
be
reformulated
every year.|258707000|259039008

The sequencing
of the influenza genome|6142004|18470003|396425006|18470003
and
recombinant DNA technology|24851008
may
accelerate|14355007
the generation
of new vaccine|7147002|398827000
strains|48532005|276768000
by allowing scientists to|308027003
substitute
new antigens|7147002|7120007
into a previously developed vaccine strain.|398827000|48532005|398827000|276768000

New technologies|7147002
are
also
being
developed to
grow
viruses|49872002
in cell culture,|4421005|252398009|4421005|61594008|362837007|252398009|362837007|61594008
which
promises
higher yields,|75540009|371879000
less
cost
,
better quality|3442003|263496004
and
surge capacity.

Research
on a universal influenza A vaccine,|73548004|396425006
targeted
against the external domain|261074009
of the transmembrane viral M2 protein|278077005|88878007
(M2e
)
,
is
being
done
at the University of Ghent|224871002
by Walter Fiers,
Xavier Saelens
and
their team[196][197][198]
and
has
now successfully concluded Phase I clinical trials.|21191007|42146005|110465008|21191007|22971001|110465008

A number|410680006|410681005
of biologics,
therapeutic vaccines
and
immunobiologics
are
also
being
investigated|116698004
for treatment|276239002|416118004
of infection
caused|23981006|134198009
by viruses.|49872002

Therapeutic biologics|262202000
are
designed
to
activate
the immune response|35024006
to virus|49872002
or
antigens.|7120007

Typically,
biologics
do
not
target
metabolic pathways|129457002
like anti-viral drugs,|372701006
but
stimulate
immune cells|255386009|4421005
such as lymphocytes,|56972008|446325007
macrophages,|58986001
and/or
antigen presenting cells,|7120007|246105001|4421005
in an effort to|19487008
drive|247750002
an immune response|35024006
towards a cytotoxic effect|253861007
against the virus.|49872002

Influenza models,|6142004|396425006
such as murine influenza,|447482001|6142004|447482001|396425006
are
convenient models to
test|269814003|272393004
the effects|253861007
of prophylactic|322837006|262073000
and
therapeutic biologics.|262202000

For example,
Lymphocyte T-Cell Immune Modulator|56972008|57184004|255386009
inhibits|61511001
viral growth
in the murine model|447482001
of influenza.[199]|6142004|396425006

Influenza|6142004|396425006
infects
many animal species,|387961004|69658003
and
transfer|302265009
of viral strains|48532005|276768000
between species|69658003
can
occur.|272120004

Birds|387972009
are
thought|88952004
to
be
the main animal|63161005|387961004
reservoirs|257687008
of influenza viruses.|55014007

Sixteen forms|246176004
of hemagglutinin
and
nine forms|422113007|246176004
of neuraminidase|80837006
have
been
identified.|7882003

All known subtypes|36692007|260837004
(HxNy
)
are
found|404684003
in birds,|387972009
but
many subtypes|260396001|260837004
are
endemic
in humans,|278412004
dogs,|448771007
horses,|35354009
and
pigs|106996007|78678003
;
populations|385436007
of camels,|423870005
ferrets,
cats,|448169003|388618001
seals,|19314006|106980009
mink,
and
whales also|106981008|20689007
show
evidence|18669006
of prior infection|236874000
or
exposure|71677004|24932003
to influenza.|6142004|396425006

Variants|40885006
of flu virus|6142004|49872002|6142004
are
sometimes
named|27468005
according to the species|69658003
the strain|48532005|276768000
is
endemic
in
or
adapted to.

The main variants|63161005|40885006
named|27468005
using|260676000
this convention|255333006
are
:
Bird Flu,|55604004
Human Flu,|6142004
Swine Flu,|442696006
Horse Flu|35354009|6142004|388441000|6142004|388445009|6142004
and
Dog Flu.|448771007|6142004|6142004

(Cat flu generally|448169003|6142004|33384004|6142004|388626009|6142004
refers|439980006
to Feline viral rhinotracheitis|13933003
or
Feline calicivirus|114005
and
not infection
from an influenza virus.|55014007
)
In pigs,|106996007|78678003
horses|35354009
and
dogs,|448771007
influenza symptoms|6142004|396425006
are
similar
to humans,|278412004
with cough,|272039006
fever|386661006
and
loss
of appetite.|33911006

The frequency|260864003|272123002
of animal diseases|387961004|64572001
are
not
as well-studied|20572008|110465008|20572008|224699009
as human infection,|278412004
but
an outbreak|443684005
of influenza|6142004|396425006
in harbor seals|54655000
caused|23981006|134198009
approximately 500 seal deaths|26175008|19314006|419620001|26175008|19314006|268923008|26175008|106980009|419620001|26175008|106980009|268923008
off the New England coast|7147002|223664003
in 1979?1980.

On the other hand,|74964007|85562004|74964007|302539009
outbreaks|443684005
in pigs|106996007|78678003
are
common|72906007
and
do
not
cause|23981006|134198009
severe mortality.[42]|24484000|409651001

Flu symptoms|6142004
in birds|387972009
are
variable|255372005
and
can
be
unspecific.

The symptoms
following|255260001
infection
with low-pathogenicity avian influenza|62482003|264418008|55604004|371880002|264418008|55604004
may
be
as
mild|255604002
as ruffled feathers,|23336004
a small reduction|255507004|58294000|255507004|260400001|255507004|289928003
in egg production,|102263004|263828003
or
weight loss|89362005
combined|89780004
with minor respiratory disease.|410599005|50043002|255606000|50043002

Since
these mild symptoms|162468002
can
make
diagnosis in the field difficult,|439401001|255798002|52925006|255798002|52925006
tracking|257719005
the
spread|410677005
of avian influenza|55604004
requires
laboratory testing|269814003
of samples|123038009
from infected birds.|387972009

Some
strains|48532005|276768000
such as Asian H9N2|414978006
are
highly virulent|75540009
to poultry|359839008|28230009
and
may
cause|23981006|134198009
more extreme symptoms|242762006|12565001
and
significant mortality.|386134007|409651001

In its most highly pathogenic form,|4757001|75540009|264418008|246176004
influenza|6142004|396425006
in chickens|409910000|226955001
and
turkeys|425134008|107066006
produces
a sudden appearance|255363002|386548000|255363002|255412001
of severe symptoms|162470006
and
almost 100% mortality|409651001
within two days.|420797005|258703001

As the virus|49872002
spreads|410677005
rapidly|418694008
in the crowded conditions|260905004
seen
in the intensive farming|224816003
of chickens|409910000|226955001
and
turkeys,|425134008|107066006
these outbreaks|443684005
can
cause|23981006|134198009
large economic losses|255509001
to poultry farmers.|51438007

An avian-adapted, highly pathogenic strain|387972009|75540009|264418008|48532005|387972009|75540009|264418008|276768000
of H5N1|55604004
(called HPAI A
(H5N1|55604004
)
,
for "highly pathogenic avian influenza virus|389070009
of type A|261664005
of subtype H5N1"|260837004|55604004
)
causes|134198009
H5N1 flu,|55604004|6142004
commonly
known|36692007
as "avian influenza"|55604004
or
simply "bird flu",|55604004
and
is
endemic
in many bird populations,|387972009|385436007
especially
in Southeast Asia.|223585008

This Asian lineage strain|414978006|48532005|414978006|276768000
of HPAI A
(H5N1|55604004
)
is
spreading|410677005
globally.

It
is
epizootic
(
an epidemic
in non-humans|278412004
)
and
panzootic
(
a disease affecting animals|64572001|247591002|387961004|64572001|248448006|387961004
of many species,|69658003

over a wide area|90522003|42798000
)
,
killing|248007002
tens
of millions
of birds|387972009
and
spurring|49620009
the culling
of hundreds
of millions
of other birds|74964007|387972009
in an attempt to
control|31509003
its spread.|410677005

Most
references
in the media|61695000
to "bird flu"|55604004
and
most
references
to H5N1|55604004
are
about
this specific strain.[206][207]|69658003|48532005|69658003|276768000

At present,|52101004|246105001
HPAI A
(H5N1|55604004
)
is
an avian disease,|387972009|64572001
and
there
is
no evidence|18669006
suggesting
efficient human-to-human transmission|260375008|409699001
of HPAI A
(H5N1|55604004
).

In almost
all cases,|398241000|413769002
those infected
have
had
extensive physical contact|41118005|76933008
with infected birds.|387972009

In the future,
H5N1|55604004
may
mutate|55446002
or
reassort
into a strain|48532005|276768000
capable
of efficient human-to-human transmission.|260375008|409699001

The exact changes|243326001|263703002
that
are
required
for this to happen
are
not well understood.|20572008|66216009

However,
due to the high lethality|75540009|371879000
and
virulence
of H5N1,|55604004
its endemic presence,|386397008
and
its large|255509001
and
increasing biological host reservoir,|260369004|12893009|257687008
the H5N1 virus|421264001
was
the world's pandemic threat
in the 2006?07 flu season,|6142004|21864008
and
billions
of dollars|284175004
are
being
raised|260399008
and
spent researching H5N1|55604004
and
preparing
for a potential influenza pandemic.[188]|30207005|6142004|30207005|396425006

In pigs swine influenza|106996007|106996007|442696006|78678003|78678003|442696006
produces

lethargy,|214264003
sneezing,|162367006
coughing|272039006
,
difficulty breathing|267036007
and
decreased appetite.|64379006

In some cases|398241000|413769002
the infection
can
cause|23981006|134198009
abortion.|70317007|386639001

Although
mortality|409651001
is
usually low,|62482003|371880002
the virus|49872002
can
produce
weight loss|89362005
and
poor growth,|11403006|255351007
causing|23981006
economic loss
to farmers.|106388008

Infected pigs|106996007|78678003
can
lose
up to 12 pounds|258693003
of body weight|27113001|39857003
over a 3|260313008

Direct transmission|255589003|258150004
of an influenza virus|55014007
from pigs|106996007|78678003
to humans|278412004
is
occasionally possible|371930009|60022001
(
this
is
called zoonotic swine flu|442696006
).

In all,
50 human cases|278412004|398241000|278412004|413769002
are
known|36692007
to
have
occurred|272120004
since
the virus|49872002
was
identified|7882003
in the mid-20th century,|255562008
which
have
resulted|42752001|394617004
in six deaths.[211]|422218008|419620001|422218008|268923008

In 2009,
a swine-origin H1N1 virus|106996007|255395001|442352004|78678003|255395001|442352004

"swine flu"|442696006
caused|23981006|134198009
the 2009 flu|6142004

but
there
is
no evidence|18669006
that
it
is
endemic
to pigs|106996007|78678003
(i.e.|42146005|22971001

actually
a swine flu|442696006

or
of transmission|258150004
from pigs|106996007|78678003
to people,|125676002
instead the virus|49872002
