(also

is
a state|398070004
of decreased blood volume|70908000
;
more specifically,|242762006
decrease|260400001|260370003
in volume|118565006|419569009
of blood plasma.|419185008

It
is
thus
the intravascular component|261101003|246093002
of volume contraction|118565006|78558002|419569009|78558002
(
or
loss
of blood volume|16086006
due to things
such as hemorrhaging|131148009
or
dehydration,|34095006

_hypovolemia_|28560003
and
_volume contraction_|118565006|78558002|419569009|78558002
are
sometimes
used|394850002
synonymously.

Hypovolemia|28560003
is
characterized
by salt|387390002
(sodium|39972003
)
depletion|69251000
and
thus
differs
from dehydration,|34095006
which
is
defined
as excessive loss|260378005
of body water.[3]|38348009

to neurogenic dysfunction|386585008
and

of the vasomotor centre|26216008
or
drugs|410942007

used|394850002
to
treat|395077000
hypertensive individuals.|125676002|385435006

Other examples|74964007
include|55919000
during surgery|83578000
due to the use|277889008|419385000
of anesthetics|394577000|373266007
and
in-operation bleeding|83578000|131148009
or
a ruptured ovarian cyst|95598005
associated|47429007
with PCOS|69878008
(polycystic ovarian syndrome|69878008
which
may
cause|23981006|134198009
severe internal bleeding,|24484000|260521003|131148009
leading|236874000
to hypovolemic shock.|39419009

Clinical symptoms|58147004
may
not
be
present|52101004|246105001
until 10?20%
of total whole-blood volume|268384009|260232004
is
lost.

Hypovolemia|28560003
can
be
recognized
by tachycardia,|3424008|6285003
diminished blood pressure,|1250004|75367002|1250004|392570002|1250004|386536003
[8]
and
the absence|2667000|418560003
of perfusion|88058003
as
assessed
by skin signs|119325001|72670004|39937001|72670004|181469002|72670004
(skin turning pale|119325001|282987006|398979000|119325001|282987006|301888000|119325001|282987006|274643008|119325001|282987006|371262000|39937001|282987006|398979000|39937001|282987006|301888000|39937001|282987006|274643008|39937001|282987006|371262000|181469002|282987006|398979000|181469002|282987006|301888000|181469002|282987006|274643008|181469002|282987006|371262000
)
and/or
capillary refill|248753002
on forehead,|52795006
lips|261114002
and
nail beds.|56820002|181578005

The patient|116154003
may
feel|285854004
dizzy,|404640003
faint,|271594007
nauseated|422587007
,
or
very|260358002
thirsty.|59299002

These signs|72670004
are
also characteristic
of most types|261664005
of shock.|27942005

Note
that
in children,|410601007|160499008
compensation|260234003|59811005
can
result|394617004
in an artificially high blood pressure|38341003
despite hypovolemia.|28560003

Children|410601007|160499008
will
typically
compensate|17275008
(
maintain|385630006
blood pressure|75367002|392570002|386536003
despite loss
of blood volume|16086006
)
for a longer period|255511005|259037005
than adults,|133936004
but
will
deteriorate
rapidly|418694008
and
severely|24484000
once
they
do
begin|255395001
to
decompensate.|5650002

This
is
another reason|410666004
(
aside from initial lower blood volume|884001|261122009|16086006|232714002|261122009|16086006
)
that even
the possibility
of internal bleeding|260521003|131148009
in children|410601007|160499008
should
almost always
be
treated|28995006
aggressively.

Also
look|386548000
for obvious signs|72670004
of external bleeding|261074009|131148009
while
remembering
that people|125676002
can
bleed|131148009
to death internally|419620001|260521003|268923008|260521003
without any external blood loss.|261074009|131148009|261074009|250771004

Also
consider
possible mechanisms|371930009|257544000|60022001|257544000
of injury
that
may
have
caused|23981006|134198009
internal bleeding|260521003|131148009
such as ruptured|415747007|263862003
or
bruised internal organs.|125667009|260521003|410653004

If
trained|118629009|62193008
to do so
and
the situation permits,|958006
conduct|844005
a secondary survey|2603003|81170007
and
check|360160009
the chest|261179002
and
abdomen|277112006|52731004|302553009
for pain,|22253000
deformity,|276654001|127560004|417893002
guarding|250072004
,
discoloration|47415006
or
swelling.|423666004|442672001

Bleeding|131148009
into the abdominal cavity|52731004|361294009
can
cause|23981006|134198009
the classical bruising patterns|255333006|125667009|272135003|260997001|125667009|272135003
of Grey Turner's sign|62988009
or
Cullen's sign.|35187000

Most sources|260753009
state|398070004
that there
are
4 stages|260308009|261612004
of hypovolemic shock,|39419009
[9][10] however
a number|410680006|410681005
of other systems|74964007|246333005
exist
with
as
many
as 6 stages.[11]|261612004

The 4 stages|260308009|261612004
are
sometimes
known|36692007
as the "Tennis" staging|26550000|72589006
of hypovolemic shock,|39419009
as
the 4 stages|260308009|261612004
of % volume|118565006|419569009
of blood loss|131148009|250771004

of tennis|26550000
:
15,
15-30,
30-40,|259031006
40.|259031006

It
is
basically
the same|262126009
as
used|394850002
in classifying bleeding|73504009|131148009
by blood loss.|131148009|250771004

Minor hypovolemia|410599005|28560003|255606000|28560003
from a known|36692007
cause|23981006|134198009
that
has
been
completely
controlled|31509003
(
such as a blood donation
from a healthy patient|263775005|116154003
who
is
not anemic
)
may
be
countered|303502004
with initial rest|884001|258157001|232714002|258157001
for
up to half
an hour.|258702006|286551008

Oral fluids|260548002|32457005|260548002|33463005
that
include|55919000
moderate sugars|6736007|74801000
and
electrolytes|86355000
are
needed|410525008|103325001
to
replenish
depleted sodium ions.|69251000|39972003|48006008

Furthermore
the advice|420227002
for the donor|105468003
is
to
eat|48263008
good solid meals|20572008|35702001|20572008|78910004|20572008|421378002
with proteins|88878007
for the next few days.|18769003|258703001|255260001|258703001

Typically,
this
would
involve|248448006
a fluid volume|260971007
of less|276139006|263796003
than one liter,|421379005|258770004
although
this
is
highly dependent|75540009|371154000
on body weight.|27113001|39857003

Larger people|255509001|125676002|263768009|125676002
can
tolerate
slightly more blood loss|425404009|131148009|425404009|250771004
than smaller people.|263796003|125676002|255507004|125676002

More serious hypovolemia|242762006|42745003|28560003
should
be
assessed
by a physician.|309343006

External bleeding|261074009|131148009
should
be
controlled|31509003
by direct pressure.|255589003|279046003|255589003|13543005|255589003|257893003

If
direct pressure|255589003|279046003|255589003|13543005|255589003|257893003
fails
,
a tourniquet|38141007
should
be
used|394850002
in the case|398241000
of severe hemorrhage|24484000|131148009
that
cannot
be
controlled|31509003
by direct pressure.|255589003|279046003|255589003|13543005|255589003|257893003

Tourniquet|38141007
use|277889008|419385000
in civilian first-aid,|386308007
especially
by less-trained individuals,|276139006|118629009|125676002|276139006|118629009|385435006|276139006|62193008|125676002|276139006|62193008|385435006|263796003|118629009|125676002|263796003|118629009|385435006|263796003|62193008|125676002|263796003|62193008|385435006
remains
controversial
as
it
can
cause|23981006|134198009
potentially serious adverse effects.[13]|42745003

Other techniques|74964007|272394005
such as elevation|103720008|255456001
and
pressure points|279046003|13543005|257893003
are
not always effective.|255403003|254648000

If
a first-aid provider|386308007
recognizes
internal bleeding|260521003|131148009
the life-saving|224130005
measure|246445000|272391002
to
take|419652001
is
to immediately|49499008
call
for emergency assistance.|25876001|116697009

Emergency oxygen|25876001|24099007
should
be
immediately|49499008
employed|224363007
to
increase|260366006
the efficiency|260375008
of the patient's|116154003
remaining
blood supply.|87612001|425398004|119273009|425398004

This intervention|225334002
can
be
life-saving.|224130005

The use|277889008|419385000
of intravenous fluids (IVs)|118431008
may
help
compensate|17275008
for lost fluid volume,|260971007
but
IV fluids|118431008
cannot
carry|288345009
oxygen|24099007
in the way
that blood|87612001|119273009
can
,
however blood substitutes|87612001|119273009
are
being
developed
which
can.

Infusion|447826007
of colloid
or
crystalloid IV fluids|118431008
will
also
dilute|421399004
clotting factors|350475008
within the blood,|87612001|119273009
increasing|260369004
the risk|30207005
of bleeding.|131148009

It
is
current best|15240007|20572008|15240007|3442003
practice
to
allow
permissive hypotension|45007003
in patients|116154003
suffering
from hypovolemic shock[15]|39419009
both
to
ensure
clotting factors|350475008
are
not overly
diluted|421399004
but
also to
stop|422117008
blood pressure|75367002|392570002|386536003
being
artificially
raised|260399008
to a point
where it "
blows
off" clots|75753009
that
have
formed.|35810008

If
the hypovolemia|28560003
was
caused|23981006|134198009
by medication,|410942007
the administration|413454004|416118004
of antidotes|372892004
may
be
appropriate
but
should
be
carefully
monitored|302805002|13288007
to
avoid
shock|27942005
or
the emergence
of other pre-existing conditions_[citation|74964007|102478008
needed|410525008|103325001
_].

Fluid replacement|78534001
is
beneficial
in hypovolemia|28560003
of stage 2,|258219007
and
is
necessary
in stage 3|258224005
and
4.

Blood transfusions
coupled
with surgical repair|4365001
are
the definitive treatment|261002007|276239002|261002007|416118004
for hypovolemia|28560003
caused|23981006|134198009

Historically
a term _desanguination_
(
from Latin _sanguis_,|87612001
blood|87612001|119273009
)
was
in use,|52101004|277889008|52101004|419385000|18720000|277889008|18720000|419385000
meaning|255586005
a massive loss|46998006
of blood.|87612001|119273009

The term
was
widely
used|394850002
by the Hippocrates
in traditional medicine|263901007|410942007
practiced
in the Greco-Roman civilization|223655008
and
in Europe|223502009
during the Middle Ages.|28288005

The word|255373000
was
possibly|60022001
used|394850002
to
describe
the lack|41277001
of personality|71565002
(
by death|419620001|268923008
or
by weakness|13791008|260407003

that often|70232002
occurred|272120004

suffered
hemorrhage|131148009
or
massive blood loss.|112648003

In cases|398241000|413769002
