*Chickenpox|38907003
*
*
(
or
*
*chicken pox|38907003
*

)
is
a highly contagious disease|75540009|191415002
caused|23981006|134198009
by primary infection|63161005|261424001
with varicella zoster virus (VZV).|19551004

It usually
starts|255395001|385652002
with vesicular skin rash mainly|53788007|119325001|53788007|39937001|53788007|181469002|63727002|271807003
on the body|279495008|123037004
and
head|69536005|302548004
rather than
at the periphery|14414005
and
becomes
itchy,|424492005
raw pockmarks,|6304003
which mostly
heal|298005009
without scarring.|275322007

On examination,|5880005
the observer typically
finds|404684003
lesions
at various stages|256220008|261612004
of healing.|298005009|90910008

Chickenpox|38907003
is
an airborne disease|64572001
spread|410677005
easily|36203004
through coughing|272039006
or
sneezing|162367006
of ill individuals|367391008|125676002|367391008|385435006
or
through direct contact|255589003|11723008|255589003|70862002
with secretions|46242002
from the rash.|271807003

A person|125676002
with chickenpox|38907003
is
infectious one|421379005
to two days|420797005|258703001
before the rash|271807003
appears.

They
remain
contagious
until all lesions
have
crusted|33342007
over|21481007
(
this
takes|419652001
approximately six days|26175008|422218008|258703001
).

Immunocompromised patients|370391006
are
contagious
during the entire period|255503000|259037005|260232004|259037005
as new lesions|7147002
keep
appearing.

Crusted lesions|33342007
are
not contagious.[4]

Chickenpox|38907003
has
been
observed
in other primates,|74964007|388073004
including|55919000
chimpanzees[5]|1480007
and
gorillas.[6]|8807009

There
are
several theories|261028005
regarding
the origin|255395001
of the term _chicken pox_.|38907003

It
is
often|70232002
stated to|398070004
be
a modification|243326001
of _chickpeas_|227346004
(
based|418836005
on resemblance
of the vesicles|82515000
to chickpeas|227346004
)
,
[7][8]
or
due to the rash resembling chicken pecks.|271807003|409910000|271807003|226955001

Other theories|74964007
include|55919000
the designation _chicken_|118522005|409910000|118522005|226955001
for a child|410601007|160499008
(i.e.,|42146005|22971001
literally 'child pox'|410601007|160499008
)
or
a corruption
of _itching-pox_.|424492005

Samuel Johnson
explained
the designation|118522005
as "
from its
being
of no very great danger."[10]|260358002|255509001|260358002|263768009

The early|264499004
(prodromal symptoms
in adolescents|133937008
and
adults|133936004
are
nausea,|422587007
loss
of appetite,|33911006
aching|410711009
muscles,|91727004
and
headache.|25064002

This
is
followed|367409002
by the characteristic rash,|271807003
malaise|367391008
and
a low-grade fever|304213008
that
signal|38952000
the presence|386397008
of the disease.|64572001

In children|410601007|160499008
the illness|39104002
is
not usually
preceded|236874000
by prodromal symptoms
and
the first sign|276131009
is
the rash.|271807003

The rash|271807003
begins|255395001
as small red dots|255507004|386713009|420987007|255507004|371240000|420987007
on the face,|89545001|302549007
scalp,|41695006|181480002
torso|22943007
and
upper arms|69273007
and
legs|30021000
;
progressing|255314001
over 10?12 hours|259028005|123035007
to small bumps,|255507004
blisters|408764000|247464001
and
pustules|271760008
;
followed|367409002
by umbilication
and
the formation|11798007|255277001
of scabs.[11]|69640009

At the blister|408764000|247464001|417237009
stage|21191007|371508000|261612004
intense itch|103370009|424492005
is
usually
present.|52101004|246105001

Blisters|408764000|247464001
may
also
occur|272120004
on the palms,|107631008
soles|57999000
and
mucous membranes,|313268005
and
painful, shallow ulcers|22253000|429040005
may
appear
in the mouth,|74262004|123851003|21082005|181220002
the top|421812003
of the throat|54066008|49928004|264231000
and
the genital area.|263767004|42798000

These symptoms
appear
from 10
to 21 days|258703001
after infection,
and
the infected person|125676002
is
typically infectious
from one|421379005
to two days|420797005|258703001
prior to the appearance|386548000|255412001
of the rash|271807003
and
remains
infectious
until four|421534005
or
five days|421820001|258703001
after its appearance.|386548000|255412001

Adults|133936004
may
have
a more widespread rash,|242762006|85333001|271807003
and
longer fever|255511005|386661006
;
and
are
more likely to|242762006|2931005
experience
complications,|116223007
such as varicella pneumonia.[11]|195911009

Chickenpox|38907003
is
rarely fatal,|103356009|399166001
although
it
is
generally more severe|24484000
in adult males|133936004|248153007
than
in adult females|224526002
or
children.|410601007|160499008

Non-immune pregnant women|255386009|255409004
and
those
with a suppressed immune system|245780008|116003000
are
at highest risk|15508007
of serious complications.|42745003|116223007

Chickenpox|38907003
is
believed to
be
the cause|134198009
of one third|421379005|70905002
of stroke cases|230690007|398241000|230690007|413769002
in children.|410601007|160499008

The most common late complication|4757001|72906007|260383002|116223007|4757001|72906007|260383002|263718001
of chickenpox|38907003
is
shingles|4740000
(herpes zoster|4740000|19551004
)
,
caused|23981006|134198009
by reactivation
of the _varicella zoster_ virus decades|19551004
after the initial episode|884001|272128006|232714002|272128006
of chickenpox.|38907003

The diagnosis|439401001
of varicella|38907003|19551004
is
primarily clinical,|58147004
with typical early "prodromal" symptoms,|264499004
and
then
the characteristic rash.|271807003

Confirmation|74996004
of the diagnosis|439401001
can
be
sought
through
either
examination|5880005
of the fluid|32457005|33463005|255765007
within the vesicles|82515000
of the rash,|271807003
or
by testing blood|87612001|119273009|272393004|87612001|272393004|119273009
for evidence|18669006
of an acute immunologic response.|272118002|37523008

Vesicular fluid|63727002|32457005|63727002|33463005|63727002|255765007|63727002
can
be
examined|64049009
with a Tsanck smear,
or
better|3442003
with examination|5880005
for direct fluorescent antibody.|255589003|5733007

The fluid|32457005|33463005|255765007
can
also
be
"
cultured|252398009|61594008
",
whereby
attempts
are
made
to
grow
the virus|49872002
from a fluid sample.|258442002

Blood tests|252275004
can
be
used|394850002
to
identify|7882003
a response
to acute infection|63171007
(IgM
)
or
previous infection|9130008
and
subsequent immunity|255260001|58915005
(IgG
).[13]

Prenatal diagnosis|439401001
of fetal varicella infection|38907003
can
be
performed|398166005
using|260676000
ultrasound,|359659005
though
a delay
of 5 weeks|264706000|258705008|264605009|258705008
following|255260001
primary maternal infection|63161005|288252009|261424001|288252009
is
advised.|424900004

A PCR|258066000|103338009
(DNA|24851008
)
test|269814003|272393004
of the mother's amniotic fluid|72705000|77012006
can
also
be
performed|398166005
,
though
the risk|30207005
of spontaneous abortion|17369002
due to the amniocentesis procedure|34536000
is
higher|75540009|371879000
than the risk|30207005
of the baby|418119000
developing
fetal varicella syndrome.[14]|38907003|19551004

Primary varicella|63161005|38907003|63161005|19551004|261424001|38907003|261424001|19551004
is
a disease|64572001
that
is
endemic
to all countries worldwide.|223369002

Varicella|38907003|19551004
has
a prevalence
that
is
stable|58158008
from generation
to generation.[15]

In temperate countries,|223369002
chickenpox|38907003
is
primarily
a disease|64572001
of children,|410601007|160499008
with most cases|398241000|413769002
occurring|272120004
during the winter
and
spring,
most likely|2931005
due to school contact.|257698009|11723008|257698009|70862002

It
is
one|421379005
of the classic diseases|255301002|64572001|255333006|64572001
of childhood,|68433009
with the highest prevalence|75540009|371879000
in the 4?10 year old age group.|258381003|258707000|105436006|258381003|258707000|32864002|258381003|259039008|105436006|258381003|259039008|32864002

Like rubella,|36653000
it
is
uncommon|103356009
in preschool children.|410602000

Varicella|38907003|19551004
is
highly communicable,|75540009
with an infection rate
of 90%|264705001|264703008
in close contacts.|29179001|11723008|29179001|70862002

In temperate countries,|223369002
most people|125676002
become
infected
before adulthood|41847000
but
10%
of young adults|84422007|133936004
remain
susceptible.|131196009

In the tropics,
chickenpox often|38907003|70232002
occurs|272120004
in older people|70753007|125676002
and
may
cause|23981006|134198009
more serious disease.|242762006|42745003|64572001

In adults|133936004
the pock marks|46998006
are
darker|255419005
and
the scars|70582006|275322007
more prominent|242762006|4657009
than
in children.[17]|410601007|160499008

Exposure|71677004|24932003
to VZV|19551004
in a healthy child|102506008
initiates
the production
of host immunoglobulin G (IgG),|29246005
immunoglobulin M (IgM),|74889000
and
immunoglobulin A (IgA) antibodies|46046006|68498002
;
IgG antibodies|29246005|68498002
persist
for life|224130005
and
confer
immunity.|58915005

Cell-mediated immune responses|4421005|73510009|35024006|362837007|73510009|35024006
are
also important
in limiting|255469002
the scope
and
the duration|103335007
of primary varicella infection.|63161005|38907003|261424001|38907003

After primary infection,|63161005|261424001
VZV|19551004
is
hypothesized to
spread|410677005
from mucosal|313268005
and
epidermal lesions|55988001
to local sensory nerves.|255470001|262139008|3057000

VZV then|19551004
remains
latent|44104002
in the dorsal ganglion cells|255551008|53102003
of the sensory nerves.|262139008|3057000

Reactivation
of VZV|19551004
results|394617004
in the clinically distinct syndrome
of herpes zoster|4740000|19551004
(i.e.,|42146005|22971001
_shingles_|4740000
)
,
postherpetic neuralgia,|2177002
and
sometimes Ramsay Hunt syndrome type II._[citation|21954000|258195006

For pregnant women,|255409004
antibodies|68498002
produced
as a result|394617004
of immunization|127785005
or
previous infection|9130008
are
transferred|129347002
via the placenta|62669004|181455002
to the fetus.|83418008

Women|224526002
who
are
immune|255386009
to chickenpox|38907003
cannot
become
infected
and
do
not
need|410525008|103325001
to
be
concerned
about
it
for themselves
or
their infant|418119000
during pregnancy.[19]|289908002

Varicella infection|38907003
in pregnant women|255409004
could
lead|88488004
to viral transmission|258150004
via the placenta|62669004|181455002
and
infection
of the fetus.|83418008

If infection
occurs|272120004
during the first 28 weeks|255216001|258705008|232714002|258705008
of gestation,|289908002
this
can
lead|88488004
to fetal varicella syndrome|38907003|19551004
(also
known|36692007
as
_congenital varicella syndrome_|277644009
).

Effects|253861007
on the fetus|83418008
can
range
in severity|272141005
from underdeveloped toes|29707007
and
fingers|7569003|259052003
to severe anal|24484000|53505006|24484000|263939004
and
bladder malformation.|89837001|276654001|302512001|276654001

Possible problems|371930009|55607006|60022001|55607006
include|55919000
:

Infection late|260383002
in gestation|289908002
or
immediately|49499008
following|255260001
birth|3950001
is
referred to|439980006
as
"_neonatal varicella_".|255407002|38907003|255407002|19551004

Maternal infection|288252009
is
associated|47429007
with premature delivery.|6383007|282020008

The risk|30207005
of the baby|418119000
developing
the disease|64572001
is
greatest|4757001
following|255260001
exposure|71677004|24932003
to infection
in the period 7 days|259037005|258703001
prior to delivery|236973005|118215003
and
up to 7 days|258703001
following|255260001
the birth.|3950001

The baby|418119000
may
also
be
exposed|24932003
to the virus|49872002
via infectious siblings|375005
or
other contacts,|74964007|11723008|74964007|70862002
but
this
is
of less|276139006|263796003
concern
if
the mother|72705000
is
immune.|255386009

Newborns|133933007
who
develop
symptoms
are
at a high risk|15508007
of pneumonia|205237003
and
other serious complications|116223007|42745003
of the disease.[14]|64572001

After a chickenpox infection,|38907003
the virus|49872002
remains
dormant
in the body's nerve tissues.|85756007|3057000|85756007|256864008|279495008|91728009|123037004|91728009

The immune system|116003000
keeps
the virus|49872002
at bay,|21024008
but
later in life, usually|260383002|224130005
as an adult,|133936004
it
can
be
reactivated|59086009
and
cause|23981006|134198009
a different form|263735002|246176004
of the viral infection called shingles|34014006|4740000
(scientifically
known|36692007
as
*
*herpes zoster|4740000|19551004
*
*
).[23]|264657009

Many adults|260396001|133936004
who
have
had
chicken pox|38907003
as children|410601007|160499008
are
susceptible|131196009
to shingles|4740000
as adults,|133936004
often|70232002
with the accompanying condition postherpetic neuralgia,|260905004|2177002
a painful condition|22253000|260905004
that
makes
it difficult to|52925006
sleep.|258158006

Even
after the shingles rash|4740000|271807003
has
gone away,
there
can
be
night pain|36163009
in the area|42798000
affected|247591002|248448006
by the rash.[24]|271807003

Shingles|4740000
affect|4065008
one|421379005
in three adults,|421291004|133936004
especially
those who
are
immune suppressed, particularly|255386009|245780008
from cancer,|363346000|372087000
HIV,|19030005|86406008|402916007
or
other conditions.|74964007|260905004

However,
stress|262188008
can
bring|68369002
on shingles|4740000
as well,|20572008
although
scientists|308027003
are
still
researching
the connection.[24]|263538003

A shingles vaccine|4740000|398827000
is
available|103328004
for adults|133936004
over 50
who
have
had
childhood chickenpox|68433009|38907003
or
who
have
previously
had
shingles.|4740000

The vaccine|398827000
for shingles|4740000
lessens
the impact|134293005
of shingles|4740000
and
its side effects.

The
spread|410677005
of chickenpox|38907003
can
be
prevented|116699007
by isolating affected individuals.|46651001|247591002|125676002|46651001|247591002|385435006|46651001|248448006|125676002|46651001|248448006|385435006

Contagion
is
by exposure|71677004|24932003
to respiratory droplets,|258162000|449071006
or
direct contact|255589003|11723008|255589003|70862002
with lesions,
within a period lasting|259037005
from three days|421291004|258703001
prior to the onset|77374008
of the rash,|271807003
to four days|421534005|258703001
after the onset|77374008
of the rash.|271807003

The chickenpox virus|19551004
(VZV|19551004
is
susceptible|131196009
to disinfectants,|311942001
notably chlorine bleach|29276003|76885009|76885009
(i.e.,|42146005|22971001
sodium hypochlorite.|71374001

Also,
like all enveloped viruses,|49872002
VZV|19551004
is
sensitive|83185005
to desiccation,|257791009
heat|88999006
and
detergents.|264299001

Therefore
these viruses|49872002
are
relatively easy to|36203004
kill|248007002
in the environment._[citation|276339004

A varicella vaccine|396442000
was
first|255216001|232714002
developed
by Michiaki Takahashi
in 1974
derived
from the Oka strain.|286859001|48532005|286859001|276768000

It
has
been
available|103328004
in the
US since 1995 to
inoculate
against the disease.|64572001

Some countries|223369002
require
the varicella vaccination|68525005
or
an exemption
before entering elementary school.|417985001|57795002|257698009

Protection
from one dose|421379005|277406006|421379005|408102007
is
not lifelong
and
a second dose|81170007|277406006|81170007|408102007|257997001|277406006|257997001|408102007|288495006|277406006|288495006|408102007
is
necessary five years|421820001|258707000
after the initial immunization,|884001|127785005|884001|232714002|127785005|232714002
[27]
which
is
currently part|15240007|260726005
of the routine immunization schedule|50811001|127785005|416151008|50811001|127785005|410538000|50811001|127785005|416774000|50811001|416151008|50811001|410538000|50811001|416774000
in the

The chickenpox vaccine|396442000
is
not part|260726005
of the routine childhood vaccination schedule|50811001|68433009
in the UK.

In the UK,
the vaccine|398827000
is
currently only|15240007
offered|410527000
to people|125676002
who
are
particularly vulnerable
to chickenpox.|38907003

A vaccinated person|125676002
is
likely to|2931005
have
a milder case|255604002|398241000
of chickenpox|38907003
if
infected.[29]

Varicella treatment mainly|38907003|276239002|38907003|416118004|19551004|276239002|19551004|416118004
consists
of easing
the symptoms
as
there
is
no actual cure
of the condition.|260905004

Some treatments|276239002
are
however available|103328004
for relieving|1241001|397855004|398004007
the symptoms
while
the immune system|116003000
clears|84989007|263707001
the virus|49872002
from the body.|279495008|123037004

As a protective measure,|246445000|272391002
patients|116154003
are
usually
required
to
stay
at home|261770009
while
they
are
infectious to
avoid
spreading|410677005
the disease|64572001
to others.|74964007

Also,
sufferers
are
frequently|70232002
asked
to
cut|283396008
their nails|72651009
short|359530003|367450005
or
to
wear
gloves|52291003
to
prevent
scratching|40590001|53181008
and
to
minimize
the risk|30207005
of secondary infections.|264569006

The condition|260905004
resolves
by itself
within a couple
of weeks|258705008
but
meanwhile patients|116154003
must
pay
attention|6769007
to their personal hygiene.|286850002

The rash|271807003
caused|23981006|134198009
by varicella zoster virus|19551004
may
however
last
for
up to one month,|421379005|258706009|421379005|259036001
although
the infectious stage|21191007|371508000|261612004
does
not
take|419652001
longer|255511005
than a week|258705008|259038000
or
two.|420797005

Also,
staying
in a cold surrounding|285686007|355648006|82272006|355648006|84162001|355648006
can
help
in easing
the itching|424492005
as heat|88999006
and
sweat|74616000|161857006
makes
it worse.|230993007|390772001|231877006

Although
there
have
been
no formal clinical studies|246176004|58147004|110465008|246176004|58147004|224699009
evaluating
the effectiveness|255403003
of topical application|410618006|359540000|410618006
of calamine lotion,|387082008|17519006
a topical barrier preparation containing zinc oxide|346336001|42504009|42841002|359540000|346336001|42504009|42841002
and
one|421379005
of the most commonly used interventions,|4757001|394850002|225334002
it
has
an excellent safety profile.|425405005

It
is
important to
maintain|385630006
good hygiene|20572008|284779002
and
daily cleaning|69620002|228402009
of skin|119325001|39937001|181469002
with warm water to|11713004|119318008
avoid
secondary bacterial infection.|2603003|301811001|81170007|301811001

Scratching|40590001|53181008
may
also
increase|260366006
the risk|30207005
of secondary infection.[34]|264569006

To
relieve|397855004
the symptoms
of chickenpox,|38907003
people commonly|125676002
use|277889008|419385000
anti-itching creams|424492005|255621006
and
lotions.|17519006

These lotions|17519006
are
not to
be
used|394850002
on the face|89545001|302549007
or
close|29179001
to the eyes.|81745001

Neem leaves|90737002
can
be
made
into paste form|226740002|246176004
and
can
be
applied|410618006
on the rashes.|271807003

Warm water bath|11713004|119318008
with neem leaves|90737002
may
be
helpful.

Water bath|11713004|119318008
may
be
done
at least seven days|276139006|420359007|258703001|263796003|420359007|258703001
from the onset|77374008
of the vesicles.|82515000

It
should
be
done
so|223528007
because
the vesicles|82515000
contain|42504009
the virus|49872002
and
may
splash
while
bathing|129002005|60369001
and
it
may
cause|23981006|134198009
the vesicles to|82515000
appear
on subsequent regions.|255260001|410673009

An oatmeal bath also|226725004
might
help
ease discomfort.[35]|36203004|367391008|36203004|87128005

If oral acyclovir|260548002|425884003
is
started|385652002
within 24 hours|123027009|259029002
of rash onset|271807003|77374008
it
decreases|260370003
symptoms
by one day|421379005|258703001|421379005|259032004
but
has
no effect|253861007
on complication rates.|116223007|263718001

Use|277889008|419385000
of acyclovir therefore|425884003
is
not currently|15240007
recommended
for immunocompetent individuals|35194002|125676002|35194002|385435006
(i.e.,|42146005|22971001
otherwise healthy persons|263775005|125676002
without known immunodeficiency|36692007|234532001
or
on immunosuppressive medication|372823004|410942007
).

Children|410601007|160499008
younger|84422007
than 12 years|258707000
old|70753007
and
older|70753007
than one month|421379005|258706009|421379005|259036001
are
not
meant|255586005
to
receive
antiviral medication|372701006|410942007
if
they
are
not
suffering
from another medical condition|74188005|260905004
which
would
put
them at risk|410519009
of developing complications.[36]|116223007

Treatment|276239002|416118004
of chickenpox|38907003
in children|410601007|160499008
is
aimed
at symptoms
while
the immune system|116003000
deals
with the virus.|49872002

With children|410601007|160499008
younger|84422007
than 12 years|258707000
cutting|70302008|410717008
nails|72651009
and
keeping
them
clean|228402009
is
an important part|260726005
of treatment|276239002|416118004
as
they
are
more likely to|242762006|2931005
scratch|53181008
their blisters more deeply|408764000|247464001
than adults.[37]|133936004

Aspirin|387458008
is
highly|75540009
contraindicated|410536001
in children|410601007|160499008
younger|84422007
than 16 years|258707000
as
it
has
been
related|272151006|262094002
with a potentially fatal condition|399166001|260905004
known|36692007
as Reye's syndrome.[38]|74351001|264670000

Some parents|40683002
believe
that
it
is
better|3442003
for children to|410601007|160499008
contract|78558002
chickenpox|38907003
than to
get
the vaccine.|398827000

They even
go
to the extent|255590007
of exposing|24932003
their children|410601007|160499008
to others|74964007
who
have
the disease ? even|64572001
by taking
them
to "chickenpox parties."|38907003
Doctors|309343006
counter|303502004
that children|410601007|160499008
are
safer
getting
the vaccine,|398827000
which
is
a weakened form|246176004
of the virus,|49872002
than
by getting
the disease,|64572001
which
can
be
fatal.[39]|399166001

Infection
in otherwise healthy adults|102512003
tends
to
be
more severe|242762006|24484000
and
may
be
fatal.|399166001

Treatment|276239002|416118004
with antiviral drugs|372701006
(e.g.|258795003

acyclovir|425884003
or
valacyclovir|96098007
is
generally
advised|424900004
,
as long|255511005
as it
is
started|385652002
within 24?48 hours|123027009|259029002
from rash onset.|271807003|77374008

Remedies to
ease
the symptoms
of chickenpox|38907003
in adults|133936004
are
basically
the same|262126009
as those
used|394850002
on children.|410601007|160499008

Adults|133936004
are
more often|242762006|70232002
prescribed antiviral medication|372701006|410942007
as
it
is
effective|255403003|254648000
in reducing|260400001
the severity|272141005
of the condition|260905004
and
the likelihood|2931005
of developing complications.|116223007

Antiviral medicines|372701006|410942007
do
not
kill|248007002
the virus,|49872002
but
stop|422117008
it
from multiplying.|421206002

Adults|133936004
are
also
advised|424900004
to
increase|260366006
water intake to|226354008
reduce|260400001
dehydration|34095006
and
to
relieve|397855004
headaches.|25064002

Painkillers
such as paracetamol|387517004
(acetaminophen|387517004
)
are
also
recommended
as
they
are
effective|255403003|254648000
in relieving itching|1241001|424492005|397855004|424492005|398004007|424492005
and
other symptoms|74964007
such as fever|386661006
or
pains.|22253000

Antihistamines|372806008
relieve|397855004
itch|424492005
and
may
be
used|394850002
in cases|398241000|413769002
where the itch|424492005
prevents|116699007
sleep,|258158006
because
they
are
also sedative.|372614000

As
with children,|410601007|160499008
antiviral medication|372701006|410942007
is
considered more useful
for those adults|133936004
who
are
more prone to|242762006|1240000
develop
complications.|116223007

These
include|55919000
pregnant women|255409004
or
people|125676002
who
have
a weakened immune system.[40]|116003000|259031006

Sorivudine,
a nucleoside analogue|47368004
has
been
reported|229059009|223458004
to
be
effective|255403003|254648000
in the treatment|276239002|416118004
of primary varicella|63161005|38907003|63161005|19551004|261424001|38907003|261424001|19551004
in healthy adults|102512003
(case reports only|398241000|229059009|398241000|223458004
)
,
but
large-scale clinical trials|255509001|19892000|110465008|255509001|278111002|110465008
are
still
needed to|410525008|103325001

febrile purpura,|386661006|423902002
malignant chickenpox|21594007|38907003
with purpura,|423902002
postinfectious purpura,|423902002
purpura fulminans,|13507004
and
anaphylactoid purpura.|191306005

These syndromes
have
variable courses,|255372005|288524001
with febrile purpura|386661006|423902002
being
the most benign|4757001|30807003
of the syndromes
and
having
an uncomplicated outcome.|263914008|394617004

In contrast,
malignant chickenpox|21594007|38907003
with purpura|423902002
is
a grave clinical condition|58147004|260905004
that
has
a mortality rate|409651001
