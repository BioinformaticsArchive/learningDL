is
a rare neurovascular peripheral pain disorder|84638005|14414005|22253000|64572001|103356009|14414005|22253000|64572001
in which blood vessels,|59820001
usually
in the lower extremities|61685007
(
or
hands|85562004
)
,
are
episodically
blocked|26036001|112232007
(frequently on and off daily|70232002|69620002
)
,
then
become hyperemic|30098003
and
inflamed.

There
is
severe burning pain|76948002|76948002|90673000|76948002|62404004|24484000|36349006
(
in the small fiber sensory nerves|255507004|88545005|262139008
)
and
skin redness.|444827008

The attacks|216299002
are
periodic|81591007
and
are
commonly
triggered|410658008
by heat,|88999006
pressure,|279046003|13543005|257893003
mild activity,|255604002|48761009|255604002|55561003|255604002|258745004|255604002|257733005
exertion,|19487008
insomnia|193462001
or
stress.|262188008

Erythromelalgia|37151006
may
occur|272120004
either
as a primary|63161005|261424001
or
secondary disorder|2603003|64572001|81170007|64572001
(i.e.|42146005|22971001

a disorder|64572001
in
and
of itself
or
a symptom
of another condition|260905004
).

Secondary erythromelalgia|403391003
can
result|394617004
from small fiber peripheral neuropathy|255507004|116272000|42658009|255507004|400293002|42658009|255507004|87028007|42658009|255507004|37202001|42658009
of any cause,|134198009
essential thrombocytosis|109994006
(erythromelalgia|37151006
can
also
develop
in the presence|386397008
of normal platelet counts|165555003
in patients|116154003
with myeloproliferative disorder|425333006|128842008
)
,
[2] hypercholesterolemia,|260306008|13644009
mushroom|106562006|227252000
or
mercury poisoning,|85180002
and
some autoimmune disorders..|85828009

Primary erythromelalgia|403390002
is
caused|23981006|134198009
by mutation|55446002
of the voltage-gated sodium channel ?-subunit gene _SCN9A_.|39972003|255592004|67271001

In 2004 Erythromelalgia|37151006
became
the first human disorder|255216001|278412004|64572001|232714002|278412004|64572001
in which
it
has
been
possible to|371930009|60022001
associate|47429007
an ion channel mutation|48006008|255592004|55446002
with chronic neuropathic pain|90734009|247398009
;[3]|260313008
this
became
possible|371930009|60022001
when
a Yale neurologist|56397003
spotted|271807003|64996003|9126005|23840004|285305004
a Beijing
geneticists|159141008
team paper|50833004
in the Journal
of Medical Genetics|74188005
titled
"Mutations|55446002
in SCN9A,
Encoding
a Sodium Channel Alpha Subunit,|39972003|255592004|103027002|39972003|255592004|115486005
in Patients|116154003
With Primary Erythromelalgia"|403390002
;
a connection|263538003
was
made
that
this sodium channel mutation|39972003|255592004|55446002
was
expressed
primarily
in peripheral pain sensing neurons.|14414005|22253000|106148006|47220008

Conversely,
in December 2006
a University of Cambridge team|224871002
reported|229059009|223458004
an SCN9A mutation|55446002
that
created
a complete "lack|255594003|41277001
of" pain sensation
in the family|35359004
of a Pakistan street performer.|223603007|257710009|420158005|223603007|398099009|420158005

He
felt|285854004
no pain,|22253000
walked|129006008|282146009
on hot coals|264018002|34323004
and
stabbed|242879005|410706007
himself to
entertain
crowds.

Primary erythromelalgia|403390002
may
be
classified|73504009
as
either
familial|35359004|255401001
or
sporadic,|75741005
with the familial form|35359004|246176004|255401001|246176004
inherited|255404009
in an autosomal dominant manner.|263681008

Both
of these
may
be
further|46053002
classified|73504009
as
either
juvenile|133937008
or
adult onset.|133936004|77374008

Juvenile onset|133937008|77374008
occurs|272120004
prior to age 20|424144002
and
frequently|70232002
prior to age 10.|424144002

While
the genetic cause|3950001|134198009|255395001|134198009
of the juvenile|133937008
and
sporadic adult onset forms|75741005|133936004|77374008|246176004
is
often|70232002
known,|36692007
this
is
not
the case|398241000
for the adult onset familial form.[5]|133936004|77374008|35359004|246176004|133936004|77374008|255401001|246176004

Recent research|6493001
in the U.S.|223688001

found|404684003
the incidence
of EM (
the number|410680006|410681005
of people|125676002
a year|258707000|259039008
diagnosed|439401001
with EM) to
be
1.3|260305007
per 100,000.

The rate
for women|224526002
was
higher ? 2.0|75540009|371879000
per 100,000
per year ?|258707000|259039008
than men,|339947000
which
was
just 0.6.

The median age|399488007|424144002|260528009|424144002
at diagnosis|439401001
was
61.

These rates
were
five|421820001
times higher|75540009|371879000
than those
estimated|414135002
by an earlier Norwegian study ?|264499004|17095009|110465008|264499004|17095009|224699009
the only other known research describing EM incidence.|50607009|36692007|420295001|36692007

Approximately five percent|26175008|421820001|118582008
of those with EM|20401003|421463005
have
the autosomal dominant|263681008
(Primary-Inherited|63161005|255404009|261424001|255404009
)
form|246176004
of the disease.[6]|64572001

The most prominent symptoms|4757001|4657009
of erythromelalgia|37151006
are
episodes|272128006
of erythema,|444827008
swelling|423666004|442672001
,
a painful deep-aching|22253000|131197000|410711009
of the soft tissue|181607009
(usually
either
radiating|8754004
or
shooting|410705006
)
and
tenderness,|247348008
along
with a painful burning sensation primarily|22253000|90673000
in the extremities.|66019005|2592007

These symptoms
are
often symmetric|70232002|18772005
and
affect|4065008
the lower extremities more frequently|61685007|70232002
than the upper extremities.|53120007

Symptoms
may
also
affect|4065008
the ears|117590005|1910005
and
face.|89545001|302549007

For secondary erythromelalgia,|403391003
attacks|216299002
typically
precede|236874000
and
are
precipitated
by the underlying primary condition.|63161005|260905004|261424001|260905004

For primary erythromelalgia,|403390002
attacks|216299002
can
last
from an hour|258702006|286551008
to months|258706009
at a time|410669006
and
occur|272120004
infrequently to frequently|84638005|70232002
with multiple times daily.|260396001|410669006|69620002|260396001|417929005|69620002

Common triggers|72906007
for these episodes|272128006
are
exertion,|19487008
heating|88999006
of the affected extremities,|247591002|66019005|247591002|2592007|248448006|66019005|248448006|2592007
and
alcohol|419442005|53041004|430837008
or
caffeine consumption,|255641001
and
any pressure|279046003|13543005|257893003
applied|410618006
to the limbs.|66019005

In some patients sugar|116154003|2331003|116154003|74801000
and
even melon consumption|260177005
have
also
been
known|36692007
to
provoke|410658008
attacks.|216299002

Many
of those with primary erythromelalgia|20401003|403390002|421463005|403390002
avoid
wearing shoes|43983001
or
socks|262156000
as the heat|88999006
this
generates
is
known to|36692007
produce
erythromelalgia attacks.|37151006|216299002

Raynaud's phenomenon often|266261006|70232002
coexists
in patients|116154003
with Erythromelalgia.[7]|37151006

In general, erythromelalgia|60132005|37151006
seems
to
consist
of neuropathological|394599008
and
microvascular alterations.|263809005

How
this
occurs|272120004
in secondary erythromelalgia|403391003
is
poorly|556001
understood|66216009
and
may
be
specific|69658003
to the underlying primary condition.|63161005|260905004|261424001|260905004

Primary conditions|63161005|260905004|261424001|260905004
that
have
been
shown
to
elicit|263516000
erythromelalgia|37151006
are
listed
in diagnosis,|439401001
below.[5]|264706000|264605009

Primary erythromelalgia|403390002
is
a better understood autosomal dominant disorder.|3442003|66216009|263681008|64572001

The neuropathological symptoms|394599008
of primary erythromelalgia|403390002
arise|68727004
from hyperexcitability
of C-fibers|400293002|37202001
in the dorsal root ganglion.|71710004|244455004

Specifically,
nociceptors
(neurons|47220008
responsible|394851003
for the sensation|106148006|271712005|272144002
and
conduction|251089002|278252000
of painful stimuli|22253000|8927009
)
appear
to
be
the primarily
affect|4065008
neurons|47220008
in these fibers.|400293002|37202001

This hyperexcitability
results|394617004
in the severe burning pain|76948002|76948002|90673000|76948002|62404004|24484000|36349006
experienced
by patients.|116154003

While
the neuropathological symptoms|394599008
are
a result|394617004
of hyperexcitability,
microvascular alterations|263809005
in erythromelalgia|37151006
are
due to hypoexcitability.

The sympathetic nervous system|68365008|362484004
controls|54776003|31509003
cutaneous vascular tone|119325001|59820001|223628004|119325001|59820001|258691001|39937001|59820001|223628004|39937001|59820001|258691001|181469002|59820001|223628004|181469002|59820001|258691001
and
altered response
of this system|246333005
to stimuli|8927009
such as heat likely|88999006|2931005
results|394617004
in the observed microvascular symptoms.|263809005

In
both
cases,|398241000|413769002
these changes|243326001|263703002
in excitability|102893002
are
typically
due to mutation|55446002
of the sodium channel NaV1.7.|39972003|255592004

These differences|263735002
in excitability alterations|102893002
between the sympathetic nervous system|68365008|362484004
and
nociceptors
is
due to different expression|263735002|10012005
of sodium channels|39972003|255592004
other than NaV1.7
in them.[5]|264706000|264605009

Several medications|261028005|410942007
including|55919000
ergot derivatives|55811003
such as bromocriptine|387039007
and
pergolide,|372498008
verapamil,|372754009
and
nifedipine|387490003
have
been
associated|47429007
with medication-induced erythromelalgia.|410942007|16404004|37151006

The consumption
of two species|420797005|69658003
of related fungi,|272151006|414561005|262094002|414561005
_Clitocybe acromelalga_|67865002
from Japan,|223583001
[8]
and
_Clitocybe amoenolens_|67865002
from France,|223666001
[9]
has
led|88488004|236874000
to several cases|261028005|398241000|261028005|413769002
of mushroom-induced erythromelalgia|106562006|16404004|37151006|227252000|16404004|37151006
which
lasted
from 8 days|258703001
to 5 months.[10]|264706000|258706009|264605009|258706009

An epidemic form|246176004
of this syndrome
occurs|272120004
in secondary students|2603003|65853000|81170007|65853000
in rural China.|223581004

In 1987
a virus - erythromelalgia-associated poxvirus -|49872002|37151006|47429007|424976006|37151006|47429007|424976006
was
reported|229059009|223458004
to
have
been
recovered|74822006
from throat|54066008|49928004|264231000
swabs|257261003|408098004|420401004
from such
an outbreak.|443684005

The genome|18470003
of this virus|49872002
has
been
sequenced|72633008
and
it
appears
that
this virus|49872002
is
a strain|48532005|276768000
of ectromelia virus.[13]|39353009

Since
this virus|49872002
has
not yet
been
isolated|46651001
from other outbreaks|74964007|443684005
to date|410671006
this putative association|263534001|272151006
should
be
treated|28995006
with circumspection.

_N.B.|258310009

This section|62083003|118630004
pertains
solely
to primary erythromelalgia|403390002
as the secondary form|2603003|246176004|81170007|246176004
is
too poorly|556001
understood._|66216009

There
are
10 known mutations|36692007|55446002
in the voltage-gated sodium channel ?-subunit NaV1.7 encoding gene,|39972003|255592004|67271001
_SCN9A_.

This channel|255592004
is
expressed primarily
in nociceptors
of the dorsal root ganglion|71710004|244455004
and
the sympathetic ganglion neurons.|55139000|47220008

Nine|422113007
of these mutations|55446002
have
received
further|46053002
study|110465008|224699009
and
they
have
all
shown
to
result|394617004
in similar biophysical alterations,
Table 1.|86407004

As
can
be
seen
from table 1,|86407004
the primary effect|63161005|253861007|261424001|253861007
of erythromelalgia mutations|37151006|55446002
is
NaV1.7 channels|255592004
that
activate
at more hyperpolarized potentials.|242762006|30207005

NaV1.7 channels|255592004
act
largely
as
threshold sensors|118589004|408746007
and
initiate
action potentials.|129264002|30207005

Consequently,
this shift|9546005
in their activation profile results|394617004
in channels|255592004
that
open|56116003
closer|29179001
to the resting membrane potential.|258157001|83097008|30207005

In many mutations,|55446002
this shift|9546005
of activation
is
accompanied
by shifts|9546005
in the voltage sensitivity|35209006|365705006
of fast|16985007|277748003
and/or
slow inactivation,|419443000
often|70232002
in the depolarized direction.|260672003

This results|394617004
in channels|255592004
that
are
open|56116003
for a longer|255511005
of period|259037005
of time,|410669006
producing
larger|255509001|263768009
and
more prolonged changes|242762006|255224006|243326001|242762006|255224006|263703002
in membrane potential.|83097008|30207005

Some
of these mutant channels|255592004
have
been
expressed
in dorsal root ganglion (DRG)|71710004|244455004
or
sympathetic neurons.|47220008

In DRG neurons|47220008
expressing
the F1449V mutation,|55446002
a lower threshold|261122009|118589004
is
required
for action potential creation|129264002|30207005|410615009
(93.1 ? 12.0 pA
than those expressing wild-type channels|262290003|261664005|255592004
(124.1 ? 7.4 pA
).

Furthermore,
while
DRG neurons|47220008
expressing
wild-type|262290003|261664005
channels|255592004
only
respond
with a few action potentials,|57176003|129264002|30207005
those expressing F1449V channels|255592004
respond
with a high-frequency train|27732004|62193008
of action potentials.|129264002|30207005

There
is
a similar effect|253861007
in DRG neurons|47220008
expressing
the L858H
and
A863P mutants.

Here,
there
is
also
a notable change|243326001|263703002
in resting membrane potential,|258157001|83097008|30207005
being
depolarized
by 4-7 mV|260308009
versus
wild-type channel expressing cells.|262290003|246238003|255592004

The situation
is
different, however,|263735002
in sympathetic neurons|47220008
expressing
the L858H mutation.|55446002

While
L858H
expressing
sympathetic ganglion|55139000
are
depolarized
~5mV
relative|125677006|29920004
to wild-type expressing neurons,|262290003|261664005|47220008
their threshold|118589004
for action potential initian_[clarification|129264002|30207005
needed|410525008|103325001
_]
is
notably higher.|75540009|371879000

Furthermore,
while
current injection|15240007|28289002|15240007|385218009|15240007|129326001
of 40pA
for 950ms
provokes|410658008
an average
of 6 action potentials|129264002|30207005
in sympathetic neurons|47220008
expressing
wild-type|262290003|261664005
channels|255592004
this stimulation evokes only approximately 2 action potentials|122545008|410658008|26175008|30207005|122545008|386205007|26175008|129264002|122545008|284013002|26175008|129264002
with reduced overshoots|260400001
in sympathetic neurons|47220008
expressing
L858H mutant channels.|255592004

Further investigation|46053002|386053000
has
demonstrated
that
the differences|263735002
in response
between DRG
and
sympathetic neurons|47220008
is
due to expression|10012005
of NaV1.8
in the former.|9130008

Consequently,
expression|10012005
of NaV1.8 channels|255592004
in sympathetic neurons also|47220008
expressing
L858H mutant NaV1.7 results|394617004
in neurons|47220008
with a depolarized resting membrane potential|258157001|83097008|30207005
that nevertheless
have
a normal action potential threshold|17621005|129264002|30207005|118589004|258744000|129264002|30207005|118589004
and
overshoot.[15]

An effective,|255403003|254648000
though
not
recommended
,
treatment|276239002|416118004
for erythromelalgia symptoms|37151006
is
cooling
of the affected area.|247591002|42798000|248448006|42798000

Activation
of wild-type channels|262290003|261664005|255592004
is
unaffected
by cooling.

L858F mutant channels,|255592004
however,
are
activated
at more depolarized potentials|242762006|30207005
when
cooled
than
at normal body temperature.|87273009

At 16?C
the activation
V?
of the mutant channel|255592004
is
only 4.6mV more|50607009|420295001
hyperpolarized
that wild-type|262290003|261664005
versus
9.6mV more
hyperpolarized
at 35?C.

Fast inactivation|16985007|277748003
is
affected|247591002|248448006
in a similar manner
in
both
wild-type|262290003|261664005
and
L858F mutant channel|255592004
and
is
,
thus,
unlikely to
contribute
to symptom resolution
due to cooling.

While
such cooling
is
unlikely to
affect|4065008
neuronal cell bodies,|47220008|4421005|279495008|47220008|4421005|123037004|47220008|362837007|279495008|47220008|362837007|123037004

and
are
present|52101004|246105001
in the skin.[17]|119325001|39937001|181469002

Erythromelalgia|37151006
is
a difficult condition to|52925006|260905004
diagnose|439401001
as
there
are
no specific tests|69658003|269814003|69658003|272393004
available.|103328004

To
get
a diagnosis|439401001
can
take|419652001
many months|258706009
and
the patient|116154003
will
often|70232002
have
seen
6
or
7 specialists|309395003
before finding out|404684003
what
is
wrong
with them._[citation

Once
it
has
been
established|263748003|385645004
that
it
is
not secondary erythromelalgia ?|403391003
see|281004000
below ? then
a programme
of management|413454004|119270007
can
be
put
in place.|257557008|421066005

Some diseases|64572001
present|52101004|246105001
with symptoms
similar
to erythromelalgia.|37151006

Complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS),|128200000
for instance,
presents|52101004|246105001
with severe burning pain|76948002|76948002|90673000|76948002|62404004|24484000|36349006
and
redness|386713009|371240000
except these symptoms
are
often unilateral|70232002|66459002
(
versus
symmetric|18772005
)
and
may
be
proximal|40415009
instead of purely
or
primarily distal.|46053002

Furthermore,
attacks|216299002
triggered|410658008
by heat|88999006
and
resolved
by cooling
are
less common|276139006|72906007|263796003|72906007
with CRPS.|128200000

Erythromelalgia|37151006
is
sometimes
caused|23981006|134198009
by other disorders.|74964007|64572001

A partial list|255609007
of diseases|64572001
known|36692007
to
precipitate
erythromelalgia|37151006
is
below.[5]|264706000|264605009

For secondary erythromelalgia,|403391003
treatment|276239002|416118004
of the underlying primary disorder|56416009
is
the most primary method|4757001|63161005|260686004|4757001|63161005|272394005|4757001|261424001|260686004|4757001|261424001|272394005
of treatment,|276239002|416118004
though
aspirin|387458008
has
been
thought|88952004
to
reduce|260400001
symptoms
of erythromelalgia|37151006
it
is
rare to|84638005|103356009
find
evidence|18669006
that
this
is
effective.|255403003|254648000

Mechanical cooling|261018001
of the limbs|66019005
by elevating|75540009
them
can
help
or
managing|119270007
the ambient environment frequently|276339004|70232002
is
often necessary constantly|70232002
as
flares
occur|272120004
due to sympathetic autonomic dysfunction|72167002|386585008
of the capillaries.|20982000

The pain|22253000
that accompanies
it
is
severe|24484000
and
treated|28995006
separately
(
the pain|22253000
is
similar
to CRPS,|128200000
phantom limb|59603003
or
thalamic pain syndrome|88269008|22253000|277285005
).

Patients|116154003
are
strongly
advised|424900004
'

*NOT

* to
place|257557008|421066005
the affected limbs|247591002|66019005|248448006|66019005

relieve|397855004
symptoms
when
flaring
occurs.|272120004

It
may
seem
a good idea|20572008|363878000
but
it
precipitates
problems further|55607006|46053002
down the line causing damage|50009006|23981006|37782003
to the skin|119325001|39937001|181469002
and
ulceration|429040005
often intractable|70232002|20646008
due to the damaged skin.|37782003|119325001|37782003|39937001|37782003|181469002

Primary erythromelalgia management|403390002|413454004|403390002|119270007
is
symptomatic, i.e.|264931009|42146005|264931009|22971001

treating painful symptoms only.|28995006|22253000

Specific management tactics|69658003|413454004|69658003|119270007
include|55919000
avoidance
of attack|217315002|216299002
triggers
such as
:
heat,|88999006
change|243326001|263703002
in temperature,|105723007|246508008
exercise|61686008
or
over exertion,|419912001
alcohol,|419442005|53041004|430837008
and
spicy foods.|228071009

This list
is
by no means|255586005
comprehensive
as
there
are
many triggers to|260396001
set
off a 'flaring' episode|272128006
that
are
inexplicable.

Whilst
a cool environment|276339004
is
helpful
in keeping
the symptoms
in control,|31509003
the use|277889008|419385000
of cold water baths|285686007|11713004|285686007|119318008|82272006|11713004|82272006|119318008|84162001|11713004|84162001|119318008
is
strongly
discouraged.

In pursuit
of added relief sufferers|224978009
can
inadvertently
cause|23981006|134198009
tissue damage|37782003
or

demonstrated
the efficacy
of IV lidocaine|349832008

oral mexilitine,|260548002

it
