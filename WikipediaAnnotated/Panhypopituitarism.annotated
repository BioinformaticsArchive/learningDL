*Hypopituitarism|74728003
*
*
is
the decreased|1250004|260400001|260371004
(_hypo_) secretion|46242002
of one|421379005
or
more
of the eight hormones normally|421825006|87568004
produced
by the pituitary gland|56329008|181125003
at the base
of the brain.|12738006|258335003

If there
is
decreased secretion|1250004|46242002|260400001|46242002|260371004|46242002
of most pituitary hormones,|84746004
the term
*
*panhypopituitarism|32390006
*
*
(_pan_ meaning "|389223000
all"
)
is
used.[3]|394850002

The signs|72670004
and
symptoms
of hypopituitarism|74728003
vary
,
depending
on which hormones|87568004
are
undersecreted
and
on the underlying cause|134198009
of the abnormality.|276654001

The diagnosis|439401001
of hypopituitarism|74728003
is
made
by blood tests,|252275004
but
often specific scans|70232002|69658003
and
other investigations|74964007|386053000
are
needed|410525008|103325001
to
find
the underlying cause,|134198009
such as tumors|108369006
of the pituitary,|56329008|58805000
and
the ideal treatment.|276239002|416118004

Most hormones|87568004
controlled|31509003
by the secretions|46242002
of the pituitary|56329008|58805000
can
be
replaced|282089006|370124000
by tablets|385055001|428673006
or
injections.|28289002|129326001

Hypopituitarism|74728003
is
a rare disease,|84638005|64572001|103356009|64572001
but
may
be
significantly
underdiagnosed
in people|125676002
with previous traumatic brain injury.|9130008|127295002

The first description|255216001|232714002
of the condition|260905004
was
made
in 1914
by the German physician Dr Morris Simmonds.[4]|7695005|309343006|309343006

The hormones|87568004
of the pituitary|56329008|58805000
have
different actions|263735002|129264002
in the body,|279495008|123037004
and
the symptoms
of hypopituitarism therefore|74728003
depend
on which hormone|87568004
is
deficient.|260372006|418446003

The symptoms
may
be
subtle
and
are
often initially|70232002|884001
attributed|246061005
to other causes.|74964007|134198009

In most
of the cases,|398241000|413769002
three|421291004
or
more hormones|242762006|87568004
are
deficient.|260372006|418446003

The most common problem|4757001|72906007|55607006
is
insufficiency|87828008
of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH)|325781003
and/or
luteinizing hormone (LH)|64182005|69527006
leading|236874000
to sex hormone abnormalities.|312263009|276654001

Growth hormone deficiency|44008002
is
more common|242762006|72906007
in people|125676002
with an underlying tumor|108369006
than those
with other causes.[1][6]|74964007|134198009

Sometimes,
there
are
additional symptoms|260364009
that
arise|68727004
from the underlying cause|134198009
;
for instance,
if
the hypopituitarism|74728003
is
due to a growth hormone-producing tumor,|35868009
there
may
be
symptoms
of acromegaly|74107003
(enlargement|56246009|118452000|442021009
of the hands|85562004
and
feet,|56459004|259051005
coarse facial features|46891001|89545001
)
,
and
if
the tumor|108369006
extends|255590007
to the optic nerve|18234004|180938001
or
optic chiasm,|244453006
there
may
be
visual field defects.|23388006

Headaches|25064002
may
also accompany pituitary tumors,|127024001
[1]|260305007
as well as
pituitary apoplexy|237701005
(infarction|55641003
or
hemorrhage|131148009
of a pituitary tumor|127024001
)
and
lymphocytic hypophysitis|61701006
(autoimmune inflammation|263680009|257552002
of the pituitary|56329008|58805000
).

Apoplexy,|230690007
in addition|260364009
to sudden headaches|255363002|25064002
and
rapidly|418694008
worsening|230993007|231877006
visual loss,|397540003
may
also
be
associated|47429007
with double vision|24982008
that results|394617004
from compression|71173004|263720003
of the nerves|3057000
in the adjacent cavernous sinus|18769003|18782006|18769003|244402005
that
control|31509003
the eye muscles.[8]|67833000

Pituitary failure|74728003
results|394617004
in many changes|243326001|263703002
in the skin,|119325001|39937001|181469002
hair|386045008|119326000
and
nails|72651009
as a result|394617004
of the absence|2667000|418560003
of pituitary hormone action|84746004|129264002
on these sites.[9]|10546003

Deficiency|260372006|248325000
of all anterior pituitary hormones|10843002
is
more common|242762006|72906007
than individual hormone deficiency.|125676002|87568004|260372006|125676002|87568004|248325000|385435006|87568004|260372006|385435006|87568004|248325000

Deficiency|260372006|248325000
of luteinizing hormone (LH)|64182005|69527006
and
follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH),|325781003
together
referred|439980006
to
as
the gonadotropins,|31895006
leads|88488004|236874000
to different symptoms|263735002
in men|339947000
and
women.|224526002

Women|224526002
experience
oligo-|23243007
or
amenorrhea|14302001
(infrequent/light|84638005|56242006|84638005|371268001
or
absent menstrual periods respectively|2667000|78456001
)
and
infertility.|8619003

Men|339947000
lose
facial, scrotal|89545001|264191007
and
trunk hair,|36724005
as well as
suffering decreased muscle mass|1250004|271696003|260400001|271696003|260371004|271696003
and
anemia.|271737000

Both
sexes|258139002|365952006|263495000|70256003|57312000
may
experience
a decrease|260400001|260370003
in libido|248095000
and
loss
of sexual function,|76859005
and
have
an increased risk|35105006|30207005|260366006|30207005
of osteoporosis|64859006
(bone fragility|272673000|59955000|3138006|59955000|90780006|59955000|128530007|59955000
).

Lack|41277001
of LH/FSH
in children|410601007|160499008
is
associated|47429007
with delayed puberty.[1][5]|400003000

Growth hormone (GH) deficiency|44008002
leads|88488004|236874000
to a decrease|260400001|260370003
in muscle mass,|271696003
central obesity|248311001
(increase|260366006
in body fat|248300009
around the waist|33673004|243989000
)
and
impaired attention|260379002|6769007|40226000|6769007
and
memory.|303116000|106136008

Children|410601007|160499008
experience
growth retardation|444896005
and
short stature.[1][5]|237837007

Adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) deficiency|237692001
leads|88488004|236874000
to adrenal insufficiency,|237785004|386584007
a lack|41277001
of production
of glucocorticoids|419933005
such as cortisol|396458002
by the adrenal gland.|23451007|181127006

If
the problem|55607006
is
chronic, symptoms|90734009
consist
of fatigue,|84229001
weight loss,|89362005
failure to thrive|433476000
(
in children|410601007|160499008
)
,
delayed puberty|400003000
(
in adolescents|133937008
)
,
hypoglycemia|271327008
(low blood sugar levels|271327008
)
,
anemia|271737000
and
hyponatremia|89627008
(low sodium levels|386619000|258395000
).

If
the onset|77374008
is
abrupt, collapse,|27942005|16277007|271787007
shock|27942005
and
vomiting|249497008
may
occur.|272120004

ACTH deficiency|237692001
is
highly similar|75540009
to primary Addison's disease,|56416009
which
is
cortisol deficiency|396458002|260372006|396458002|248325000
as the result|394617004
of direct damage|255589003|37782003
to the adrenal glands|23451007
;
the latter form,|246176004
however,
often|70232002
leads|88488004|236874000
to hyperpigmentation|49765009
of the skin,|119325001|39937001|181469002
which
does
not
occur|272120004
in ACTH deficiency.[10]|237692001

Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) deficiency|82598004
leads|88488004|236874000
to hypothyroidism|40930008
(lack|41277001
of production
of thyroxine|73187006|313408009
(T4
)
and
triiodothyronine|61275002|250668004
(T3
)
in the thyroid.|69748006|61020000

Typical symptoms
are
tiredness,|84229001
intolerance|29544009
to cold,|285686007|82272006|84162001
constipation,|14760008
weight gain,|262286000
hair loss|278040002
and
slowed thinking,|419443000|88952004
as well as
a slowed heart rate|48867003
and
low blood pressure.|45007003

In children,|410601007|160499008
hypothyroidism|40930008
leads|88488004|236874000
to delayed growth|276617005
and
in extreme inborn|12565001
forms|246176004
to a syndrome
called
_cretinism_.[1][5]|190268003|75065003

Prolactin (PRL)|70454002
plays|300776002
a role
in breastfeeding,|169741004
and
inability
to breastfeed|169741004
may
point
at abnormally low prolactin levels.[7]|371880002|70454002|258395000

Antidiuretic hormone (ADH) deficiency|71338005|260372006|71338005|248325000
leads|88488004|236874000
to the syndrome
of _diabetes insipidus_|15771004|45369008
(
unrelated|262241003
to diabetes mellitus|73211009
:
inability to
concentrate
the urine,|78014005
leading|236874000
to polyuria|28442001
(production
of large amounts|255509001|107651007
of clear urine|167236000
)
that
is
low|62482003|371880002
in solutes,
dehydration|34095006
and?
in compensation?extreme thirst|260234003|12565001|59299002|59811005|12565001|59299002
and
constant need to|410525008|103325001
drink|226465004
(polydipsia,
as well as
hypernatremia|286926003
(high sodium levels|75540009|365761000|371879000|365761000
in the blood|87612001|119273009
).

ADH deficiency|260372006|248325000
may
be
masked|261382003
if there
is
ACTH deficiency,|237692001
with symptoms only
appearing
when
cortisol|396458002
has
been
replaced.[7]|282089006|370124000

Oxytocin (OXT) deficiency generally|237697007
causes|134198009
few symptoms,|57176003
as
it
is
only
required
at the time|410669006
of childbirth|3950001|118215003|169836001|386216000
and
breastfeeding.[1]|169741004

Kallmann syndrome|93559003
causes|134198009
deficiency|260372006|248325000
of the gonadotropins only.|31895006

Bardet-Biedl syndrome|5619004
and
Prader-Willi syndrome|89392001
have
been
associated|47429007
with pituitary hormone deficiencies.|74728003|87568004|84746004|260372006|84746004|248325000

The pituitary gland|56329008|181125003
is
located
at the base
of the brain,|12738006|258335003
and
intimately
connected
with the hypothalamus.|67923007|264483005

It
consists
of two lobes|420797005
:
the posterior pituitary,|37512009|86301004|422457003
which
consists
of nervous tissue branching|91728009|77796000|110657001|77796000
out of the hypothalamus,|67923007|264483005
and
the anterior pituitary,|10843002
which
consists
of hormone-producing epithelium.|87568004|31610004

The posterior pituitary|37512009|86301004|422457003
secretes
antidiuretic hormone,|71338005
which
regulates
osmolarity|62970001
of the blood,|87612001|119273009
and
oxytocin,|112115002
which
causes|134198009
contractions|78558002
of the uterus|35039007|181452004
in childbirth|3950001|118215003|169836001|386216000
and
participates
in breastfeeding.[12]|169741004

The pituitary|56329008|58805000
develops
in the third week|70905002|258705008|70905002|259038000
of embryogenesis
from interactions
between the diencephalon part|119264001
of the brain|12738006|258335003
and
the nasal cavity.|279549004|263481003

The brain cells|12738006|4421005|258335003|4421005
secrete
FGF-8,|88919005
Wnt5a
and
BMP-4,
and
the nasal cavity BMP-2.|279549004|263481003

Together,
these cellular signals|38952000
stimulate
a group|261586004|160481000|389109008
of cells|4421005
from the nasal cavity to|279549004|263481003
form|246176004
Rathke's pouch,|89718004
which
becomes
independent of the nasal cavity|279549004|263481003
and
develops
into the anterior pituitary|10843002
;
this process|415178003
includes|55919000
the suppression|80633008|258761002
of production
of a protein|88878007
called
Sonic hedgehog|106922004|388917009
by the cells|4421005
of Rathke's pouch.|89718004

The cells then|4421005
differentiate|263933003
further|46053002
into the various hormone-producing cells|256220008|87568004|4421005
of the pituitary.|56329008|58805000

This
requires
particular transcription factors|10589004
that
induce|16404004
the expression|10012005
of particular genes.|67271001

Some
of these transcription factors|10589004
have
been
found|404684003
to
be
deficient|260372006|418446003
in some
forms|246176004
of rare combined pituitary hormone deficiencies (CPHD)|84638005|89780004|84746004|260372006|84638005|89780004|84746004|248325000|84638005|89780004|74728003|87568004|103356009|89780004|84746004|260372006|103356009|89780004|84746004|248325000|103356009|89780004|74728003|87568004
in childhood.|68433009

These
are
_HESX1_,
_PROP1_,
_POU1F1_,
_LHX3_,
_LHX4_,
_TBX19_,
_SOX2_
and
_SOX3_.

Each transcription factor|10589004
acts
in particular groups|261586004|160481000
of cells.|4421005

Therefore,
various genetic mutations|256220008|55446002
are
associated|47429007
with specific hormone deficiencies.|69658003|87568004|260372006|69658003|87568004|248325000

For instance,
_POU1F1_
(also
known|36692007
as Pit-1|79261008
)
mutations|55446002
cause|23981006|134198009
specific deficiencies in growth hormone,|69658003|44008002
prolactin|70454002
and
TSH.

In addition|260364009
to the pituitary,|56329008|58805000
some
of the transcription factors|10589004
are
also
required
for the development|278923009
of other organs|74964007|410653004
;
some
of these mutations|55446002
are
therefore also
associated|47429007
with specific birth defects.[14][15]|69658003|276654001

Most
of the hormones|87568004
in the anterior pituitary|10843002
are
each part|260726005
of an _axis_|39976000|388282002
that
is
regulated
by the hypothalamus.|67923007|264483005

The hypothalamus|67923007|264483005
secretes
a number|410680006|410681005
of releasing hormones,|129299003|87568004
often|70232002
according to a circadian rhythm,|30920001
into blood vessels|59820001
that
supply|425398004
the anterior pituitary|10843002
;
most
of these
are
stimulatory|36645008
(thyrotropin-releasing hormone,|412495007
corticotropin-releasing hormone,|71971001|121758005
gonadotropin-releasing hormone|397197007
and
growth hormone-releasing hormone,|16628008|395870004
apart from dopamine,|412383006|32779004
which
suppresses|245780008
prolactin production.|70454002

In response
to the releasing hormone rate,|129299003|87568004
the anterior pituitary|10843002
produces
its hormones|87568004
(TSH,
ACTH,
LH,
FSH,
GH
)
which in turn|282987006
stimulate
effector hormone glands|87568004|362884007
in the body,|279495008|123037004
while
prolactin (PRL)|70454002
acts
directly
on the breast gland.

Once the effector glands|362884007
produce
sufficient hormones|51117008|87568004
(thyroxine,|73187006|313408009
cortisol,|396458002
estradiol|126172005
or
testosterone|43688007|85470006
and
IGF-1|5699003
)
,
both
the hypothalamus|67923007|264483005
and
the pituitary cells|82406005
sense|106148006
their abundance
and
reduce|260400001
their secretion|46242002
of stimulating hormones.|87568004

The hormones|87568004
of the posterior pituitary|37512009|86301004|422457003
are
produced
in the hypothalamus|67923007|264483005
and
are
carried|288345009
by nerve endings|3057000|261782000|3057000|422117008|256864008|261782000|256864008|422117008
to the posterior lobe|255551008
;
their feedback system|246333005
is
therefore
located
in the hypothalamus,|67923007|264483005
but
damage|37782003
to the nerve endings|3057000|261782000|3057000|422117008|256864008|261782000|256864008|422117008
would
still
lead|88488004
to a deficiency|260372006|248325000
in hormone release.[1]|87568004|58000006|87568004|68776005|87568004|258760001|87568004|129299003|87568004|115956009

Unless
the pituitary damage|56329008|37782003|58805000|37782003
is
being
caused|23981006|134198009
by a tumor|108369006
that
overproduces
a particular hormone,|87568004
it
is
the lack|41277001
of pituitary hormones|84746004
that
leads|88488004|236874000
to the symptoms
described
above,|261183002
and
an excess|260378005
of a particular hormone|87568004
would
indicate|410535002
the presence|386397008
of a tumor.|108369006

The exception
to this rule|10828004
is
prolactin|70454002
:
if
a tumor|108369006
compresses|37204000
the pituitary stalk,|53909008|188007004|424038003
a decreased blood supply means|1250004|87612001|425398004|255586005|1250004|119273009|425398004|255586005|260400001|87612001|425398004|255586005|260400001|119273009|425398004|255586005|260371004|87612001|425398004|255586005|260371004|119273009|425398004|255586005
that
the lactotrope cells,|65357006
which
produce
prolactin,|70454002
are
not
receiving
dopamine|412383006|32779004
and
therefore
produce
excess prolactin.|260378005|70454002

Hence,
mild elevations|255604002|255456001
in prolactin|70454002
are
attributed|246061005
to
stalk
compression.|71173004|263720003

Very high prolactin levels,|260360000|70454002|258395000
though
,
point
more strongly|242762006
towards a prolactinoma|134209002
(prolactin-secreting tumor|70454002|108369006
).[5][17]|264706000|264605009

The diagnosis|439401001
of hypopituitarism|74728003
is
made
on blood tests.|252275004

Two types|420797005|261664005
of blood tests|252275004
are
used|394850002
to
confirm|59156000
the presence|386397008
of a hormone deficiency|87568004|260372006|87568004|248325000
:
basal levels,|57195005|258395000
where blood samples|119297000
are
taken?usually|419652001
in the morning?|73775008
without any form|246176004
of stimulation,|122545008
and
dynamic tests,|229027002|269814003|229027002|272393004
where blood tests|252275004
are
taken|419652001
after the injection|28289002|385218009|129326001
of a stimulating substance.|105590001

Measurement|272391002
of ACTH
and
growth hormone usually|56234005|395883003
requires
dynamic testing,|229027002|229027002|272393004
whereas
the other hormones|74964007|87568004
(LH/FSH,
prolactin,|70454002
TSH
)
can
typically
be
tested|272393004
with basal levels.|57195005|258395000

There
is
no adequate direct test|51117008|255589003|269814003|51117008|255589003|51117008|255589003|272393004|88323005|255589003|269814003|88323005|255589003|88323005|255589003|272393004
for ADH levels,|258395000
but
ADH deficiency|260372006|248325000
can
be
confirmed|59156000
indirectly
;
oxytocin levels|112115002|258395000
are
not routinely
measured.[1]|258104002

Generally,
the finding|404684003
of a combination|89780004
of a low pituitary hormone|62482003|84746004|371880002|84746004
together with a low hormone|62482003|87568004|371880002|87568004
from the effector gland|362884007
is
indicative
of hypopituitarism.|74728003

Occasionally,
the pituitary hormone|84746004
may
be
normal|17621005|258744000
but
the effector gland hormone|362884007|87568004
decreased|1250004|260400001|260371004
;
in this case,|398241000
the pituitary|56329008|58805000
is
not
responding
appropriately
to effector hormone changes,|87568004|243326001|87568004|263703002
and
the combination|89780004
of findings|404684003
is
still suggestive|7196007
of hypopituitarism.[5]|74728003

Levels|258395000
of LH/FSH
may
be
suppressed|245780008
by a raised prolactin level,|260399008|70454002|258395000|260399008|70454002|276625007
and
are
therefore
not interpretable
unless
prolactin|70454002
is
low|62482003|371880002
or
normal.|17621005|258744000

In men,|339947000
the combination|89780004
of low LH|62482003|371880002
and
FSH
in combination|89780004
with a low testosterone|62482003|43688007|62482003|85470006|371880002|43688007|371880002|85470006
confirms|59156000
LH/FSH deficiency|260372006|248325000
;
a high testosterone|75540009|43688007|75540009|85470006|371879000|43688007|371879000|85470006
would
indicate|410535002
a source elsewhere|260753009
in the body|279495008|123037004
(
such as a testosterone-secreting tumor|43688007|108369006|85470006|108369006
).

In women,|224526002
the diagnosis|439401001
of LH/FSH deficiency|260372006|248325000
depends
on
whether
the woman|224526002
has
been
through the menopause.|161712005

Before the menopause,|161712005
abnormal menstrual periods|263654008|78456001
together with low estradiol|62482003|126172005|371880002|126172005
and
LH/FSH levels|31003009
confirm|59156000
a pituitary problem|56329008|55607006|58805000|55607006
;
after the menopause|161712005
(
when
LH/FSH levels|31003009
are
normally
elevated|75540009
and
the ovaries|15497006|83238006
produce
less estradiol|276139006|126172005|263796003|126172005
)
,
inappropriately low LH/FSH|62482003|371880002
alone|105529008
is
sufficient.|51117008

Stimulation tests|15695009
with GnRH|397197007
are
possible,|371930009|60022001
but
their use|277889008|419385000
is
not
encouraged.[5][7]

For TSH,
basal measurements|57195005|272391002
are
usually sufficient,|51117008
as well as
measurements|272391002
of thyroxine to|73187006|313408009
ensure
that
the pituitary|56329008|58805000
is
not simply
suppressing|245780008
TSH production
in response
to hyperthyroidism|34486009
(
an overactive thyroid gland|34486009|362884007|263829006|69748006|263829006|181117000
).

A stimulation test with thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH)|15695009|412495007
is
not
regarded
as useful.

Prolactin|70454002
can
be
measured|258104002
by basal level,|57195005|258395000|57195005|276625007
and
is
required
for the interpretation|280452008
of LH
and
FSH
results|394617004
in addition|260364009
to the confirmation|74996004
of hypopituitarism|74728003
or
diagnosis|439401001
of a prolactin-secreting tumor.[1]|70454002|108369006

Growth hormone deficiency|44008002
is
almost certain|17162000|255544004
if
all other pituitary tests|74964007|56329008|269814003|74964007|56329008|272393004|74964007|58805000|269814003|74964007|58805000|272393004
are
also abnormal,|263654008
and
insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) levels|5699003|258395000|79104007|258395000
are
decreased.|1250004|260400001|260371004

If
this
is
not
the case,|398241000
IGF-1 levels|5699003|258395000
are
poorly predictive|556001
of the presence|386397008
of GH deficiency|260372006|248325000
;
stimulation testing|122545008|122545008|272393004
with the insulin tolerance test|269877001
is
then
required.

This
is
performed|398166005
by administering insulin to|418283001|412222002
lower|261122009
the blood sugar|87612001|2331003|87612001|74801000|119273009|2331003|119273009|74801000
to a level|258395000|276625007
below 2.2 mmol/l.|260306008|258718000

Once this
occurs|272120004
,
growth hormone levels|80874005
are
measured.|258104002

If
they
are
low|62482003|371880002
despite the stimulatory effect|36645008|253861007
of the low blood sugars,|271327008
growth hormone deficiency|44008002
is
confirmed.|59156000

The test|269814003|272393004
is
not
without risks,|30207005
especially
in those prone|1240000
to seizures|91175000
or
are
known|36692007
to
have
heart disease,|56265001
and
causes|134198009
the unpleasant symptoms
of hypoglycemia.|271327008

Alternative tests|269814003|272393004
(
such as the growth hormone releasing hormone stimulation test|252202002|122545008
)
are
less useful,|276139006|263796003
although
a stimulation test|15695009
with arginine|52625008
may
be
used|394850002
for diagnosis,|439401001
especially
in situations
where an insulin tolerance test|269877001
is
thought to|88952004
be
too dangerous.

If GH deficiency|260372006|248325000
is
suspected,|415684004
and
all other pituitary hormones|74964007|84746004
are
normal, two different stimulation tests|17621005|420797005|263735002|15695009|258744000|420797005|263735002|15695009
are
needed|410525008|103325001
for confirmation.[7]|74996004

If morning cortisol levels|73775008|62037009
are
over 500 nmol/l,|21481007|258720002
ACTH deficiency|237692001
is
unlikely,
whereas
a level less|258395000|276625007
than 100
is
indicative.

Levels|258395000
between 100-500
require
a stimulation test.|15695009

This,
too,
is
done
with the insulin tolerance test.|269877001

A cortisol level|62037009
above 500
after
achieving
a low blood sugar|271327008
rules|10828004
out ACTH deficiency,|255529000|237692001
while
lower levels|261122009|258395000
confirm|59156000
the diagnosis.|439401001

A similar stimulation test|15695009
using|260676000
corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH)|71971001|121758005
is
not sensitive|83185005
enough
for the purposes|363675004
of the investigation.|386053000

If
the insulin tolerance test|269877001
yields
an abnormal result,|280415008
a further test|46053002|269814003|46053002|46053002|272393004
measuring|258104002|263571004
the response
of the adrenal glands|23451007
to synthetic ACTH|325824002
(
the ACTH stimulation test|49466006|122545008|15695009
can
be
performed|398166005
to
confirm|59156000
the diagnosis.|439401001

Stimulation testing|122545008|122545008|272393004
with metyrapone|395794007
is
an alternative.

Some
suggest
that
an ACTH stimulation test|49466006|122545008|15695009
is
sufficient|51117008
as first-line investigation,|255216001|50009006|386053000|232714002|50009006|386053000
and
that
an insulin torlerance test|16890009
is
only
needed|410525008|103325001
if
the ACTH test|49466006
is
equivocal.|42425007

The insulin tolerance test|269877001
is
discouraged

None|260413007
of the tests|269814003|272393004
for ACTH deficiency|237692001
are
perfect,
and
further tests|46053002|269814003|46053002|272393004
after a period|259037005
of time|410669006
may
be
needed|410525008|103325001
if initial results|884001|394617004|232714002|394617004
are
not conclusive.[1]

Symptoms
of diabetes insipidus|15771004|45369008

the blood osmolarity falls,|87612001|62970001|1912002|119273009|62970001|1912002
there
is
a lack|41277001
of ADH
due to lack|41277001
of pituitary function|56329008|246464006|58805000|246464006
("cranial diabetes insipidus"|45369008
).

In contrast,
there
is
no change|243326001|263703002
if
the kidneys|64033007|17373004
are
unresponsive|20646008|422768004
to ADH
due to a different problem|263735002|55607006
("nephrogenic diabetes insipidus"|111395007
).[1]|260305007

If one|421379005
of these tests|269814003|272393004
shows
a deficiency|260372006|248325000
of hormones|87568004
produced
by the pituitary,|56329008|58805000
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan|113091000
of the pituitary|56329008|58805000
is
the first step in identifying|255216001|398298007|7882003|232714002|398298007|7882003
an underlying cause.|134198009

MRI|113091000
may
show
various tumors|256220008|108369006
and
may
assist|116697009|119265000
in delineating other causes.|134198009

Tumors|108369006
smaller|263796003|255507004
than 1 cm|260305007
are
referred|439980006
to
as
_microadenomas_,
and
larger lesions|255509001|263768009
are
called
_macroadenomas_.

Computed tomography|77477000
with radiocontrast
may
be
used|394850002
if MRI|113091000
is
not available.|103328004

Formal visual field testing|246176004|86944008
by perimetry|103752008
is
recommended,
as
this
would
show
evidence|18669006
of optic nerve compression|72983001
by a tumor.[7]|108369006

Other tests|74964007|269814003|74964007|272393004
that
may
assist|116697009|119265000
in the diagnosis|439401001
of hypopituitarism,|74728003
especially
if
no tumor|108369006
is
found|404684003
on the MRI scan,|113091000|373205008|113091000
are
ferritin|32789000|489004
(
elevated|75540009
in hemochromatosis|399187006
)
,
angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) levels|112049007|258395000
(often|70232002
elevated|75540009
in sarcoidosis|31541009

in tumor|108369006
of germ cell origin.|4421005|255395001|362837007|255395001

If
a genetic cause|3950001|134198009|255395001|134198009
is
suspected,|415684004
genetic testing|405824009
may
be
performed.[7]|398166005

Treatment|276239002|416118004
of hypopituitarism|74728003
is
threefold
:
removing|127485006
the underlying cause,|134198009
treating|28995006
the hormone deficiencies,|87568004|260372006|87568004|248325000
and
addressing|397635003
any other repercussions|74964007
that
arise|68727004
from the hormone deficiencies.[1]|87568004|260372006|87568004|248325000

Pituitary tumors|127024001
require
treatment|276239002|416118004
when
they
are
causing|23981006
specific symptoms,|69658003
such as headaches,|25064002
visual field defects|23388006
or
excessive hormone secretion.|260378005|60877009

Transsphenoidal surgery|112237001|83578000
(removal|118292001|128303001
of the tumor|108369006
by an operation|83578000
through the nose|260540009|181195007
and
the sphenoidal sinuses|24999009
may
,
apart from addressing symptoms|397635003
related|272151006|262094002
to the tumor,|108369006
also
improve|385425000|3442003|385633008
pituitary function,|56329008|246464006|58805000|246464006
although
the gland|362884007
is
sometimes
damaged|37782003
further|46053002
as a result|394617004
of the surgery.|83578000

When
the tumor|108369006
is
removed|127485006
by craniotomy|25353009
(
opening|56116003
the skull|89546000
)
,
recovery
is
less likely?|276139006|2931005|263796003|2931005
but
sometimes
this
is
the only suitable way to|50607009|420295001
approach
the tumor.|108369006

After surgery,|83578000
it
may
take|419652001
some time|410669006
for hormone levels to|365774006
change|243326001|263703002
significantly.

Retesting
the pituitary hormone levels|84746004|258395000|56329008|365774006|58805000|365774006
is
therefore
performed|398166005
2
to 3 months later.[5]|260280001|258706009

Prolactinomas|134209002
may
respond
to dopamine agonist treatment?medication|418222008|18629005
that
mimics
the action|129264002
of dopamine|412383006|32779004
on the lactrotrope cells,|4421005
usually bromocriptine|387039007
or
cabergoline.|386979007

This approach
may
improve|385425000|3442003|385633008
pituitary hormone secretion|84746004|46242002|56329008|60877009|58805000|60877009
in more|242762006
than half
the cases,|398241000|413769002
and
obviate
the need|410525008|103325001
for supplementary treatment.[1][5][17][20]|276239002|416118004

Other specific underlying causes|74964007|69658003|134198009
are
treated|28995006
as normally.

For example,
hemochromatosis|399187006
is
treated|28995006
by venesection,|127606004|396540005|367425007
the regular removal|17854005|118292001|17854005|128303001
of a fixed amount|102491009|107651007|261010008|107651007
of blood.|87612001|119273009

Eventually,
this
decreases|260370003
the iron levels|42950004
in the body|279495008|123037004
and
improves|385425000|3442003|385633008
the function|246464006
of the organs|410653004
in which iron|3829006
has
accumulated.[21]

Most pituitary hormones|84746004
can
be
replaced|282089006|370124000
indirectly
by administering|418283001
the products
of the effector glands|362884007
:
hydrocortisone|396458002
(cortisol|396458002
)
for adrenal insufficiency,|237785004|386584007
levothyroxine|73187006
for hypothyroidism,|40930008
testosterone|43688007|85470006
for male hypogonadism,|48723006
and
estradiol|126172005
for female hypogonadism|16041008
(usually
with a progestogen to|20249007
inhibit|61511001
unwanted effects|253861007
on the uterus.|35039007|181452004

Growth hormone|56234005|395883003
is
available|103328004
in synthetic form,|246176004
but
needs|410525008|103325001
to
be
administered|418283001
parenterally
(
by injection|28289002|385218009|129326001
).

Antidiuretic hormone|71338005
can
be
replaced|282089006|370124000
by desmopressin|126189002
(DDAVP
)
tablets|385055001|428673006
or
nose spray.|385157007

Generally,
the lowest dose|262459003
of the replacement medication|3137001|410942007|282089006|410942007
is
used to|394850002
restore
wellbeing|405153007
and
correct
the deranged results,|394617004
as
excessive doses|260378005|277406006
would
cause|23981006|134198009
side-effects
or
complications.|116223007

Those requiring hydrocortisone|396458002
are
usually
instructed
to
increase|260366006
their dose|277406006|408102007
in physically stressful events|272379006
such as injury,
hospitalization|394656005
and
dental work|261041009
as these
are
times|410669006|417929005
when
the normal supplementary dose|17621005|277406006|17621005|408102007|258744000|277406006|258744000|408102007
may
be
inadequate,|71978007
putting
the patient|116154003
at risk|410519009
of adrenal crisis.[5][12]|24867002

Long-term follow up|308273005
by specialists|309395003
in endocrinology|394583002
is
generally
needed|410525008|103325001
for people|125676002
with known hypopituitarism.|36692007|74728003

Apart from ensuring
the right treatment|24028007|276239002|24028007|416118004
is
being
used|394850002
and
at the right doses,|24028007|277406006
this also
provides
an opportunity to
deal
with new symptoms|7147002
and
to
address|397635003
complications|116223007
of treatment.[5][7]|276239002|416118004

Difficult situations|52925006
arise|68727004
in deficiencies|260372006|248325000
of the hypothalamus-pituitary-gonadal axis|442167006
in people|125676002
(
both
men|339947000
and
women|224526002
)
who
experience
infertility|8619003
;
infertility|8619003
in hypopituitarism|74728003
may
be
treated|28995006
with subcutaneous infusions|300036000
of FSH,
human chorionic gonadotropin?|408755005|59433001|426919007
which
mimics
the action|129264002
of LH?
and
occasionally GnRH.[1][5][7]|397197007

Several hormone deficiencies|261028005|87568004|260372006|261028005|87568004|248325000
associated|47429007
with hypopituitarism|74728003
may
lead|88488004
to secondary diseases.|48873002

For instance,
growth hormone deficiency|44008002
is
associated|47429007
with obesity,|414915002
raised cholesterol|260399008|84698008|260399008|412808005
and
the metabolic syndrome,|237602007
and
estradiol deficiency|126172005|260372006|126172005|248325000
may
lead|88488004
to osteoporosis.|64859006

While
effective treatment|255403003|276239002|255403003|416118004|254648000|276239002|254648000|416118004
of the underlying hormone deficiencies|87568004|260372006|87568004|248325000
may
improve|385425000|3442003|385633008
these risks,|30207005
it
is
often necessary to|70232002
treat|395077000
them directly.[5]

Several studies|261028005|110465008|261028005|224699009
have
shown
that hypopituitarism|74728003
is
associated|47429007
with an increased risk|35105006|30207005|260366006|30207005
of cardiovascular disease|49601007
and
some also
an increased risk|35105006|30207005|260366006|30207005
of death|419620001|268923008
of about 50%
to 150%
the normal population.|17621005|385436007|17621005|389109008|258744000|385436007|258744000|389109008

It
has
been
difficult to|52925006
establish|263748003
which hormone deficiency|87568004|260372006|87568004|248325000
is
responsible|394851003
for this risk,|30207005
as
almost
all patients|116154003
studied|110465008|224699009
had
growth hormone deficiency.|44008002

The studies also|110465008|224699009
do
not
answer
the question|42425007
as to
whether
the hypopituitarism|74728003
itself
causes|134198009
the increased mortality,|35105006|409651001|260366006|409651001
or
whether
some
of the risk|30207005
is
to
be
attributed|246061005
to the treatments,|276239002
some
of which
(
such as sex hormone supplementation|312263009
)
have
a recognized adverse effect|281647001

followed|367409002
over a thousand people|125676002
for eight years|421825006|258707000
;
it
showed
an 87% increased risk|35105006|30207005|260366006|30207005

Predictors
of higher risk|15508007
were
:
female sex,|248152002
absence|2667000|418560003
of treatment|276239002|416118004

Apart from cardiovascular disease,|49601007
this study also|110465008|224699009

with a previous traumatic brain injury,|9130008|127295002
spontaneous subarachnoid hemorrhage|270907008
(
a type|261664005
of stroke|230690007
)
or
radiation therapy|108290001
involving|248448006
the head|69536005|302548004
have
a higher risk|15508007
of hypopituitarism.|74728003

After traumatic brain injury,|127295002
as
much
as a quarter
have
persistent pituitary hormone deficiencies.|74728003|87568004|84746004|260372006|84746004|248325000

Many
of these people|125676002
may
have
subtle
or
non-specific symptoms|10003008
that
are
not
linked
to pituitary problems|56329008|55607006|58805000|55607006
but
attributed|246061005
to their previous condition.|9130008|260905004

It
is
therefore possible|371930009|60022001
that
many cases|398241000|413769002
of hypopituitarism|74728003
remain
undiagnosed
,
and
that
the annual incidence|53281000
would
rise
to 31|264664006
per 100,000 annually|53281000
if
people|125676002
from these risk groups|30207005|261586004|30207005|160481000
were
to
be
tested.[1]|272393004

The pituitary|56329008|58805000
was
known|36692007
to the ancients,
such as Galen,|34385009
and
various theories|256220008
were
proposed
about its role
in the body,|279495008|123037004
but
major clues|255603008
as to the actual function|246464006
of the gland|362884007
were
not
advanced|86005002
until the late 19th century,|260383002
when
acromegaly|74107003
due to pituitary tumors|127024001
was
described.

The first known report|255216001|36692007|229059009|255216001|36692007|223458004|232714002|36692007|229059009|232714002|36692007|223458004
of hypopituitarism|74728003
was
made
by the German physician|7695005|309343006
and
pathologist Dr Morris Simmonds.|61207006|309343006

He
described
the condition|260905004
on autopsy|168461002
in a 46-year old woman|258707000|70753007|224526002|259039008|70753007|224526002
who
had
suffered severe puerperal fever eleven years|24484000|200277008|258004000|258707000|24484000|200277008|258707000|24484000|2858002|258004000|258707000|24484000|2858002|258707000|24484000|248451004|258004000|258707000|24484000|248451004|258707000
earlier,|264499004
and
subsequently suffered amenorrhea,|14302001
weakness,|13791008|260407003
signs|72670004
of rapid aging|255358001|248280005
and
anemia.|271737000

The pituitary gland|56329008|181125003
was
very small|260358002|255507004
and
there
were
few remnants|57176003
of both
the anterior|255549009
and
the posterior pituitary.|37512009|86301004|422457003

The eponym _Simmonds' syndrome_
is
used infrequently|394850002|84638005
for acquired hypopituitarism,|255396000|74728003
especially
when
cachexia|238108007
(general ill health|105724001|367391008
and
malnutrition|248325000
)
predominates.|83296008

Most
of the classic causes|255301002|134198009|255333006|134198009
of hypopituitarism|74728003
were
described
in the 20th century
;
the early 21st century|264499004
saw|281004000
the recognition|312020002
of
how common hypopituitarism|72906007|74728003
could
be
in previous head injury victims.[1]|9130008|82271004

Until the 1950s,
the diagnosis|439401001
of pituitary disease|399244003
remained
based|418836005
on clinical features|58147004
and
visual field examination,|32750006|255798002
sometimes
aided|62479008|246088000
by pneumoencephalography
and
X-ray tomography.|439101006

Nevertheless,
the field|255798002
of pituitary surgery|56329008|83578000|58805000|83578000
developed
during this time.|410669006

The major breakthrough|255603008|255298001
in diagnosis|439401001
came
with the discovery
of the radioimmunoassay|4613005
by Rosalyn Yalow
and
Solomon Berson
in the late 1950s.|260383002

This allowed
the direct measurement|255589003|272391002
of the hormones|87568004
of the pituitary,|56329008|58805000
which
as
a result|394617004
of their low concentrations|62482003|82742001|371880002|82742001
in blood|87612001|119273009
had
previously
been
hard to|72505002
measure.|246445000|272391002

Stimulation tests|15695009
were
developed
in the 1960s,
and
in 1973
the triple bolus test|275835005
was
introduced|127487003
,
a test|269814003|272393004
that combined stimulation testing|89780004|122545008|89780004|122545008|272393004
with insulin,|412222002
GnRH|397197007
and
TRH.

Imaging|363679005|278395004
of the pituitary,|56329008|58805000
and
therefore identification|286672002|7882003
of tumors|108369006
and
other structural causes,|74964007|134198009
improved|385425000|3442003
radically
with the introduction|107733003
of computed tomography|77477000
in the late 1970s|260383002
and
magnetic resonance imaging|113091000
in the 1980s.[25]
