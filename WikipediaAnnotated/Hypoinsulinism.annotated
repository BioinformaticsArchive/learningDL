*Diabetes mellitus|73211009
*
*,
or
simply
*
*diabetes|73211009
*
*,
is
a group|261586004|160481000|389109008
of metabolic diseases|30390004
in which
a person|125676002
has
high blood sugar,|75540009|87612001|2331003|75540009|87612001|74801000|75540009|119273009|2331003|75540009|119273009|74801000|371879000|87612001|2331003|371879000|87612001|74801000|371879000|119273009|2331003|371879000|119273009|74801000
either
because
the pancreas|15776009|181277001
does
not
produce
enough insulin,|412222002
or
because cells|4421005
do
not
respond
to the insulin|412222002
that
is
produced.

This high blood sugar|75540009|87612001|2331003|75540009|87612001|74801000|75540009|119273009|2331003|75540009|119273009|74801000|371879000|87612001|2331003|371879000|87612001|74801000|371879000|119273009|2331003|371879000|119273009|74801000
produces
the classical symptoms|255333006|260997001
of polyuria|28442001
(frequent urination|162116003
)
,
polydipsia
(increased thirst|35105006|59299002|260366006|59299002
)
and
polyphagia|58424009
(increased hunger|72405004
).

There
are
three main types|421291004|63161005|261664005
of diabetes mellitus (DM).|73211009

Other forms|74964007|246176004
of diabetes mellitus|73211009
include|55919000
congenital diabetes,|6160004|73211009|255399007|73211009
which
is
due to genetic defects|276654001
of insulin secretion,|412222002|46242002
cystic fibrosis-related diabetes,|190905008|272151006|73211009|190905008|262094002|73211009
steroid diabetes|116566001|73211009
induced|16404004
by high doses|261829003
of glucocorticoids,|419933005
and
several forms|261028005|246176004
of monogenic diabetes.|73211009

All
forms|246176004
of diabetes|73211009
have
been
treatable
since
insulin|412222002
became
available|103328004
in 1921,
and
type 2 diabetes|44054006
may
be
controlled|31509003
with medications.|410942007

Both
types 1|258191002
and
2
are
chronic conditions|90734009|260905004
that
cannot
be
cured.

Pancreas transplants|62438007
have
been
tried
with limited success|255469002|385669000
in type 1 DM|258191002
;
gastric bypass surgery|16453004|442338001|83578000
has
been
successful|385669000
in many|260396001
with morbid obesity|238136002
and
type 2 DM.|258195006

Gestational diabetes usually|11687002
resolves
after delivery.|236973005|118215003

Diabetes|73211009
without proper treatments|276239002
can
cause|23981006|134198009
many complications.|116223007

Acute complications|272118002|116223007
include|55919000
hypoglycemia,|271327008
diabetic ketoacidosis,|420422005
or
nonketotic hyperosmolar coma.|190329007

Serious long-term complications|42745003|116223007
include|55919000
cardiovascular disease,|49601007
chronic renal failure,|46177005
and
diabetic retinopathy|4855003
(retinal damage|41445001
).

Adequate treatment|51117008|276239002|51117008|416118004|88323005|276239002|88323005|416118004
of diabetes|73211009
is
thus important,
as well as
blood pressure control|75367002|31509003|392570002|31509003|386536003|31509003
and
lifestyle factors|60134006
such as smoking cessation
and
maintaining|385630006
a healthy body weight.|263775005|27113001|263775005|39857003

Globally,
as of 2012[[update]]
(//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title|419205000
=Diabetes_mellitus&action|73211009|129264002
=edit
)
,
an estimated 346 million people|414135002|125676002
have
type 2 diabetes.[3]|44054006

Diabetes mellitus|73211009
is
classified|73504009
into four broad categories|421534005|90522003
:
type 1,|258191002
type 2,|258195006
gestational diabetes|11687002
and
"other specific types".|74964007|69658003|261664005

The "other specific types"|74964007|69658003|261664005
are
a collection
of a few dozen individual causes.|57176003|125676002|134198009|57176003|385435006|134198009

The term "diabetes",|73211009
without qualification,
usually
refers|439980006
to diabetes mellitus.|73211009

The rare disease diabetes insipidus|84638005|64572001|15771004|84638005|64572001|45369008|103356009|64572001|15771004|103356009|64572001|45369008
has
similar symptoms
as diabetes mellitus,|73211009
but
without disturbances
in the sugar metabolism|2331003|47722004|74801000|47722004
(_insipidus_ means "|255586005
without taste"|76489005
in Latin
).

The term "type 1 diabetes"|46635009
has
replaced several former terms,|282089006|9130008|370124000|9130008
including|55919000
childhood-onset diabetes,|68433009|77374008|73211009
juvenile diabetes,|46635009
and
insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM).|46635009

Likewise,
the term "type 2 diabetes"|44054006
has
replaced several former terms,|282089006|9130008|370124000|9130008
including|55919000
adult-onset diabetes,|44054006
obesity-related diabetes,|414915002|272151006|73211009|414915002|262094002|73211009
and
noninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM).|44054006

Beyond these two types,|420797005|261664005
there
is
no agreed-
upon standard nomenclature.

Type 1 diabetes mellitus|46635009
is
characterized
by loss
of the insulin-producing beta cells|36565008|52095000|36565008|260989008
of the islets
of Langerhans
in the pancreas,|15776009|181277001
leading|236874000
to insulin deficiency.|412222002|260372006|412222002|248325000

This type|261664005
can
be
further|46053002
classified|73504009
as immune-mediated|255386009|73510009
or
idiopathic.|54690008

The majority
of type 1 diabetes|46635009
is
of the immune-mediated nature,|255386009|73510009|277302009
in which beta cell loss|36565008
is
a T-cell-mediated autoimmune attack.|28913000|4421005|73510009|263680009|217315002|28913000|4421005|73510009|263680009|216299002|28913000|362837007|73510009|263680009|217315002|28913000|362837007|73510009|263680009|216299002

There
is
no known preventive measure|36692007|262073000|246445000|36692007|262073000|272391002|36692007|129428001|246445000|36692007|129428001|272391002
against type 1 diabetes,|46635009
which
causes|134198009
approximately 10%|26175008
of diabetes mellitus cases|73211009|398241000|73211009|413769002
in North America|223503004
and
Europe.|223502009

Most affected people|247591002|125676002|248448006|125676002
are
otherwise healthy|263775005
and
of a healthy weight|263775005|27113001|263775005|272102008|263775005|39857003
when
onset|77374008
occurs.|272120004

Sensitivity|35209006|365705006
and
responsiveness|80074009
to insulin|412222002
are
usually normal, especially|17621005|258744000
in the early stages.|264499004|261612004

Type 1 diabetes|46635009
can
affect|4065008
children|410601007|160499008
or
adults,|133936004
but
was
traditionally
termed
"juvenile diabetes"|46635009
because
a majority
of these diabetes cases|73211009|398241000|73211009|413769002
were
in children.|410601007|160499008

"Brittle" diabetes,|11530004
also
known|36692007
as unstable diabetes|263922001|73211009
or
labile diabetes,|11530004
is
a term
that
was
traditionally
used|394850002
to
describe
to dramatic
and
recurrent swings|255227004
in glucose levels,|365811003
often|70232002
occurring|272120004
for no apparent reason|410666004
in insulin-dependent diabetes.|46635009

This term,
however,
has
no biologic basis|12893009|12893009|418836005
and
should
not
be
used.|394850002

There
are
many reasons|260396001|410666004
for type 1 diabetes to|46635009
be
accompanied
by irregular|49608001
and
unpredictable hyperglycemias,|80394007
frequently|70232002
with ketosis,|2538008
and
sometimes serious hypoglycemias,|42745003|271327008
including|55919000
an impaired counterregulatory response|260379002|40226000
to hypoglycemia,|271327008
occult infection,|81674002|6080000
gastroparesis|235675006
(
which
leads|88488004|236874000
to erratic absorption
of dietary carbohydrates|41829006|2331003
)
,
and
endocrinopathies|362969004
(
e.g.
,
Addison's disease|373662000|65389002
).

These phenomena
are
believed
to
occur|272120004
no more frequently|242762006|70232002
than
in 1%|260305007
to 2%|260306008
of persons|125676002
with type 1 diabetes.[8]|46635009

Type 2 diabetes mellitus|44054006
is
characterized
by insulin resistance,|48606007
which
may
be
combined|89780004
with relatively reduced insulin secretion.|260400001|412222002|46242002

The defective responsiveness|80074009
of body tissues|85756007
to insulin|412222002
is
believed to
involve|248448006
the insulin receptor.|17223004

However,
the specific defects|69658003|6920004
are
not
known.|36692007

Diabetes mellitus cases|73211009|398241000|73211009|413769002
due to a known defect|36692007|6920004
are
classified|73504009
separately.

Type 2 diabetes|44054006
is
the most common type.|4757001|72906007|261664005

In the early stage|264499004|21191007|264499004|371508000|264499004|261612004
of type 2,|258195006
the predominant abnormality|276654001
is
reduced insulin sensitivity.|260400001|412222002|35209006|260400001|412222002|365705006

At this stage,|21191007|371508000|261612004
hyperglycemia|80394007
can
be
reversed
by a variety
of measures|246445000|367346004
and
medications|410942007
that
improve|385425000|3442003|385633008
insulin sensitivity|412222002|35209006|412222002|365705006
or
reduce|260400001
glucose production|67079006|72191006
by the liver.|10200004|181268008

Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM)|11687002
resembles
type 2 diabetes|44054006
in several respects,|261028005
involving|248448006
a combination|89780004
of relatively inadequate insulin secretion|71978007|412222002|46242002
and
responsiveness.|80074009

It
occurs|272120004
in about 2%?5%
of all pregnancies|289908002
and
may
improve|385425000|3442003|385633008
or
disappear
after delivery.|236973005|118215003

Gestational diabetes|11687002
is
fully treatable,
but
requires
careful medical supervision|74188005|225313009|74188005|119270007
throughout the pregnancy.|289908002

About 20%?50%
of affected women|247591002|224526002|248448006|224526002
develop
type 2 diabetes later in life.|44054006|260383002|224130005

Though
it
may
be
transient, untreated gestational diabetes|14803004|25265005|11687002
can
damage|37782003
the health|263775005
of the fetus|83418008
or
mother.|72705000

Risks|30207005
to the baby|418119000
include|55919000
macrosomia|38206000
(high birth weight|276613009
)
,
congenital cardiac|6160004|80891009|255399007|80891009
and
central nervous system anomalies,|26216008|88425004
and
skeletal muscle malformations.|127954009|276654001|244716004|276654001

Increased fetal insulin|83469008
may
inhibit|61511001
fetal surfactant production|346667009|422248006
and
cause|23981006|134198009
respiratory distress syndrome.|46775006

Hyperbilirubinemia|14783006|26165005
may
result|394617004
from red blood cell destruction.|41898006|64597002

In severe cases,|24484000|398241000|24484000|413769002
perinatal death|10588007
may
occur|272120004
,
most commonly
as a result|394617004
of poor placental perfusion|11403006|62669004|88058003|11403006|388033005|88058003|255351007|62669004|88058003|255351007|388033005|88058003
due to vascular impairment.|59820001|40226000

Labor induction|236958009
may
be
indicated|410535002
with decreased placental function.|1250004|28858007|260400001|28858007|260371004|28858007

A Caesarean section|11466000
may
be
performed|398166005
if there
is
marked fetal distress|46998006|130955003
or
an increased risk|35105006|30207005|260366006|30207005
of injury
associated|47429007
with macrosomia,|38206000
such as shoulder dystocia.|89700002

A 2008 study|110465008|224699009
completed|255594003
in the U.S.|223688001

found|404684003
the number|410680006|410681005
of American women|224526002
entering|417985001
pregnancy|289908002
with pre-existing diabetes
is
increasing.|260369004

In fact,
the rate
of diabetes|73211009
in expectant mothers|410517006|72705000
has
more
than
doubled|1305003
in the past six years.|410513005|422218008|258707000

This
is
particularly problematic
as diabetes|73211009
raises|260399008
the risk|30207005
of complications|116223007
during pregnancy,|289908002
as well as
increasing|260369004
the potential|30207005
for the children|410601007|160499008
of diabetic mothers to|72705000
become
diabetic
in the future.

Prediabetes
indicates|410535002
a condition|260905004
that
occurs|272120004
when
a person's blood glucose levels|125676002|365812005
are
higher|75540009|371879000
than normal|17621005|258744000
but
not high|75540009|371879000
enough
for a diagnosis|439401001
of type 2 DM.|258195006

Many people|260396001|125676002
destined
to
develop
type 2 DM|258195006
spend
many years|260396001|258707000
in a state|398070004
of prediabetes
which
has
been
termed
"America's largest healthcare epidemic."[10]|255509001|263768009
:
10?11

Latent autoimmune diabetes of adults (LADA)|267426009|263680009|133936004
is
a condition|260905004
in which type 1 DM|258191002
develops
in adults.|133936004

Adults|133936004
with LADA
are
frequently initially|70232002|884001
misdiagnosed
as
having
type 2 DM,|258195006
based|418836005
on age|424144002
rather than
etiology.|134198009

Some cases|398241000|413769002
of diabetes|73211009
are
caused|23981006|134198009
by the body's tissue receptors|85756007|116647005
not
responding
to insulin|412222002
(even
when
insulin levels|16890009
are
normal,|17621005|258744000
which
is
what
separates|13184001|263869007
it
from type 2 diabetes|44054006
)
;
this form|246176004
is
very uncommon.|260358002|103356009

Genetic mutations|55446002
(autosomal
or
mitochondrial|75056005
can
lead|88488004
to defects|6920004
in beta cell function.|36565008|246464006

Abnormal insulin action|263654008|412222002|129264002
may
also
have
been
genetically
determined
in some cases.|398241000|413769002

Any disease|64572001
that
causes|134198009
extensive damage|41118005|37782003
to the pancreas|15776009|181277001
may
lead|88488004
to diabetes|73211009
(
for example,
chronic pancreatitis|234689009|68072000
and
cystic fibrosis.|190905008

Diseases|64572001
associated|47429007
with excessive secretion|260378005|46242002
of insulin-antagonistic hormones|412222002|58516001|87568004
can
cause|23981006|134198009
diabetes|73211009
(
which
is
typically
resolved
once the hormone excess|246194005
is
removed|127485006
).

Many drugs|260396001|410942007
impair|260379002|40226000
insulin secretion|412222002|46242002
and
some toxins|80917008

The ICD-10|70199000
(1992
)
diagnostic entity,|439401001|261004008
_malnutrition-related diabetes mellitus_|75524006
(MRDM|75524006
or
MMDM,
ICD-10 code E12|70199000
)
,
was
deprecated
by the World Health Organization|263775005|21139007
when
the current taxonomy|15240007
was
introduced|127487003
in 1999.[11]

The classic symptoms|255301002|255333006
of untreated diabetes|25265005|73211009
are
loss
of weight,|27113001|272102008|39857003
polyuria|28442001
(frequent urination|162116003
)
,
polydipsia
(increased thirst|35105006|59299002|260366006|59299002
)
and
polyphagia|58424009
(increased hunger|72405004
).

Symptoms
may
develop
rapidly|418694008
(weeks|258705008
or
months|258706009
)
in type 1 diabetes,|46635009
while
they usually
develop
much more slowly|242762006|419443000|4757001|419443000
and
may
be
subtle
or
absent|2667000
in type 2 diabetes.|44054006

Prolonged high blood glucose|255224006|80394007
can
cause|23981006|134198009
glucose absorption|67079006|72191006
in the lens|78076003|181169005
of the eye,|81745001|244486005
which
leads|88488004|236874000
to changes|243326001|263703002
in its shape,|107644003|246176004|300842002
resulting|42752001
in vision changes.|281004000|243326001|281004000|263703002

Blurred vision|246636008
is
a common complaint|72906007|409586006
leading|236874000
to a diabetes diagnosis|73211009|439401001|73211009
;
type 1|258191002
should
always
be
suspected|415684004
in cases|398241000|413769002
of rapid vision change,|255358001|281004000|243326001|255358001|281004000|263703002
whereas
with type 2 change|258195006|243326001|258195006|263703002
is
generally more gradual,|255343009
but
should
still
be
suspected|415684004
_[citation
needed|410525008|103325001

A number|410680006|410681005
of skin rashes|271807003
that
can
occur|272120004
in diabetes|73211009
are
collectively
known|36692007
as diabetic dermadromes.

People|125676002
(usually
with type 1 diabetes|46635009
)
may
also
present|52101004|246105001
with diabetic ketoacidosis,|420422005
a state|398070004
of metabolic dysregulation
characterized
by the smell|397686008
of acetone,|4370008
a rapid, deep breathing|271823003|131197000|255358001|181893002|255358001|289123006
known|36692007
as Kussmaul breathing,|399322006|414563008
nausea,|422587007
vomiting|249497008
and
abdominal pain,|21522001
and
altered states|398070004
of consciousness.|106167005

A rare|84638005|103356009
but
equally severe possibility|24484000
is
hyperosmolar nonketotic state,|14735008|398070004
which
is
more common|242762006|72906007
in type 2 diabetes|44054006
and
is
mainly
the result|394617004
of dehydration.|34095006

All
forms|246176004
of diabetes|73211009
increase|260366006
the risk|30207005
of long-term complications.|116223007

These typically
develop
after many years|258707000
(10?20
)
,
but
may
be
the first symptom|255216001|232714002
in those
who
have
otherwise
not
received
a diagnosis|439401001
before
that time.|410669006

The major long-term complications|255603008|116223007
relate|272151006|262094002
to
damage|37782003
to blood vessels.|59820001

Diabetes|73211009
doubles|1305003
the risk|30207005
of cardiovascular disease.|49601007

The main "macrovascular" diseases|63161005|64572001
(
related|272151006|262094002
to atherosclerosis|38716007
of larger arteries|3222005
)
are
ischemic heart disease|53741008|414795007
(angina|225566008
and
myocardial infarction,|22298006
stroke|230690007
and
peripheral vascular disease.|400047006

Diabetes also|73211009
damages|37782003
the capillaries|20982000
(causes microangiopathy.|134198009|58729003

Diabetic retinopathy,|4855003
which
affects|4065008
blood vessel formation|59820001|11798007|59820001|255277001|361097006|11798007|361097006|255277001
in the retina|5665001|181171005
of the eye,|81745001|244486005
can
lead|88488004
to visual symptoms,|162274004
reduced vision,|397540003
and
potentially blindness.

Diabetic nephropathy,|127013003
the impact|134293005
of diabetes|73211009
on the kidneys,|64033007|17373004
can
lead|88488004
to scarring changes|243326001|263703002|275322007|243326001|275322007|263703002
in the kidney tissue,|64033007|85756007|17373004|85756007|181414000|85756007
loss
of small|255507004
or
progressively larger amounts|255509001|107651007|263768009|107651007
of protein|88878007
in the urine,|78014005
and
eventually chronic kidney disease requiring dialysis.|46177005|108241001|46177005|265764009|236425005|108241001|236425005|265764009

Diabetic neuropathy|230572002
is
the impact|134293005
of diabetes|73211009
on the nervous system,|25087005|278196006
most commonly
causing|23981006
numbness,|398026008|44077006
tingling|162249002
and
pain|22253000
in the feet|56459004|259051005
and
also
increasing|260369004
the risk|30207005
of skin damage|119325001|37782003|39937001|37782003|181469002|37782003
due to altered sensation.|247325003

Together with vascular disease|27550009
in the legs,|30021000
neuropathy|386033004
contributes
to the risk|30207005
of diabetes-related foot problems|73211009|272151006|299478007|73211009|262094002|299478007
(
such as diabetic foot ulcers|280137006|371087003
that
can
be
difficult to|52925006
treat|395077000
and
occasionally
require
amputation.|81723002

The cause|134198009
of diabetes|73211009
depends
on the type.|261664005

Type 1 diabetes|46635009
is
partly
inherited|255404009
,
and
then
triggered|410658008
by certain infections,|17162000
with some evidence pointing|18669006
at Coxsackie B4 virus.|186658007|48821003|48821003

A genetic element|3950001|57795002|255395001|57795002
in individual susceptibility|125676002|76522002|125676002|118588007|385435006|76522002|385435006|118588007
to some
of these triggers
has
been
traced|260405006
to particular HLA genotypes|47038001
(i.e.,|42146005|22971001
the genetic "|3950001|255395001
self" identifiers|118522005
relied
upon
by the immune system|116003000
).

However,
even
in those
who
have
inherited|255404009
the susceptibility,|76522002|118588007
type 1 DM|258191002
seems
to
require
an environmental trigger.|276339004|276339004|410658008

The onset|77374008
of type 1 diabetes|46635009
is
unrelated|262241003
to lifestyle.|60134006

Type 2 diabetes|44054006
is
due primarily|42752001
to lifestyle factors|60134006
and
genetics.[15]

The following|255260001
is
a comprehensive list
of other causes|74964007|134198009
of diabetes|73211009
:
[16]

Insulin|412222002
is
the principal hormone|63161005|87568004|302311007|87568004
that
regulates
uptake|258763004
of glucose|67079006|72191006
from the blood|87612001|119273009
into most cells|4421005
(primarily muscle|91727004
and
fat cells,|24826007
but
not central nervous system cells|21483005|4421005|278199004|4421005
).

Therefore,
deficiency|260372006|248325000
of insulin|412222002
or
the insensitivity
of its receptors|116647005
plays|300776002
a central role|26216008
in all
forms|246176004
of diabetes mellitus.|73211009

Humans|278412004
are
capable
of digesting
some carbohydrates,|2331003
in particular
those most common|4757001|72906007
in food|255620007
;
starch,|412339002
and
some
disaccharides|15472007
such as sucrose,|11320009
are
converted
within a few hours|57176003|258702006
to simpler forms,|13673007|246176004
most notably
the monosaccharide glucose,|116257004|67079006|116257004|72191006
the principal carbohydrate energy source|63161005|2331003|260754003|302311007|2331003|260754003
used|394850002
by the body.|279495008|123037004

The rest|258157001
are
passed
on
for processing
by gut flora largely|122865005
in the colon.|263977005|302508007

Insulin|412222002
is
released|68776005|129299003
into the blood|87612001|119273009
by beta cells|36565008
(?-cells|4421005
)
,
found|404684003
in the islets
of Langerhans
in the pancreas,|15776009|181277001
in response
to rising levels|258395000
of blood glucose,|33747003
typically
after eating.|48263008

Insulin|412222002
is
used|394850002
by about two-thirds|420797005|70905002
of the body's cells|279495008|4421005|123037004|4421005
to absorb glucose|67079006|72191006
from the blood|87612001|119273009
for use|277889008|419385000
as fuel,|223373004
for conversion|272148004
to other needed molecules,|74964007|410525008|290005005|74964007|103325001|290005005
or
for storage.|48122007|440276004

Insulin|412222002
is
also
the principal control signal|63161005|31509003|302311007|31509003
for conversion|272148004
of glucose|67079006|72191006
to glycogen|36998008
for internal storage|260521003|48122007|260521003|440276004
in liver|10200004|181268008
and
muscle cells.|91727004|4421005

Lowered glucose levels|261122009|365811003|385440003|365811003
result|394617004
both
in the reduced release|260400001|58000006|260400001|68776005|260400001|258760001|260400001|129299003|260400001|115956009
of insulin|412222002
from the ?-cells|4421005
and
in the reverse conversion|272148004
of glycogen|36998008
to glucose|67079006|72191006
when
glucose levels|365811003
fall.|1912002

This
is
mainly
controlled|31509003
by the hormone glucagon,|87568004|66603002
which
acts
in the opposite manner
to insulin.|412222002

Glucose thus forcibly|67079006|72191006
produced
from internal liver cell stores|260521003|30396005|440276004
(
as glycogen|36998008
)
re-enters|228877007|417985001
the bloodstream
;
muscle cells|91727004|4421005
lack|41277001
the necessary export mechanism.|257544000

Normally,
liver cells|30396005
do
this
when
the level|258395000|276625007
of insulin|412222002
is
low|62482003|371880002
(
which normally
correlates
with low levels|62482003|258395000|371880002|258395000
of blood glucose|33747003
).

Higher insulin levels|83469008|258395000
increase|260366006
some anabolic|111151007
("building
up"
)
processes,|415178003
such as cell growth|4421005|362837007
and
duplication,|89049001
protein synthesis,|88878007|11798007
and
fat storage.|271590003|48122007|271590003|440276004

Insulin|412222002
(
or
its lack|41277001
)
is
the principal signal|63161005|302311007
in converting
many
of the bidirectional processes|415178003
of metabolism|47722004
from a catabolic|40091007
to an anabolic direction,|111151007|260672003
and
_vice versa_.

In particular,
a low insulin level|62482003|16890009|371880002|16890009
is
the trigger|410658008
for entering|417985001
or
leaving ketosis|7771000|2538008|90737002|2538008
(
the fat-burning metabolic phase|385532007|21191007
).

If
the amount|107651007
of insulin|412222002
available|103328004
is
insufficient,|71978007|423437008
if
cells|4421005
respond
poorly|556001
to the effects|253861007
of insulin|412222002
(insulin insensitivity|412222002
or
resistance|30714006
)
,
or
if
the insulin|412222002
itself
is
defective, then glucose|67079006|72191006
will
not
have
its usual effect,|253861007
so
it
will
not
be
absorbed
properly
by those body cells|279495008|4421005|123037004|4421005
that
require
it,
nor
will
it
be
stored|440276004
appropriately
in the liver|10200004|181268008
and
muscles.|91727004

The net effect|255442003|253861007
is
persistent high levels|75540009|258395000|371879000|258395000
of blood glucose,|33747003
poor protein synthesis,|11403006|88878007|11798007|255351007|88878007|11798007
and
other metabolic derangements,|74964007
such as acidosis.|51387008

When
the glucose concentration|250417005|365657003

Diabetes mellitus|73211009
is
characterized
by recurrent|255227004
or
persistent hyperglycemia,|80394007
and
is
diagnosed|439401001
by
demonstrating
any one|421379005
of the following|255260001
:
[11]

A positive result,|258758003|394617004|10828004|394617004
in the absence|2667000|418560003
of unequivocal hyperglycemia,|80394007
should
be
confirmed|59156000
by a repeat|27582007
of any
of the above methods|261183002|260686004|261183002|272394005
on a different day.|263735002|258703001|263735002|259032004

It
is
preferable to
measure|246445000|272391002
a fasting glucose level|16985007|36048009|16985007|365811003
because of the ease|36203004
of measurement|272391002
and
the considerable time commitment|410669006
of formal glucose tolerance testing,|246176004|109175000|228432001|246176004|109175000|77472006|246176004|109175000|71412006
which
takes|419652001
two hours to|420797005|258702006
complete|255594003
and
offers|410527000
no prognostic advantage
over the fasting test.|399844005

According to the current definition,|15240007
two fasting glucose measurements|420797005|52302001
above 126 mg/dl|258797006
(7.0 mmol/l)|258718000
is
considered diagnostic|439401001|261004008
for diabetes mellitus.|73211009

People|125676002
with fasting glucose levels|16985007|365811003
from 110
to 125 mg/dl|258797006
(6.1
to 6.9 mmol/l)|260273003|258718000
are
considered
to
have
impaired fasting glucose.|390951007

Patients|116154003
with plasma glucose|72191006
at
or
above 140 mg/dL|258797006
(7.8 mmol/L|258718000
)
,
but
not over 200 mg/dL|21481007|258797006
(11.1 mmol/L|258718000
)
,
two hours|420797005|258702006
after a 75 g oral glucose load|258795003|260548002|67079006|258795003|260548002|72191006
are
considered
to
have
impaired glucose tolerance.|267426009

Of these two prediabetic states,|420797005
the latter
in particular
is
a major risk factor|255603008|80943009
for progression|246453008|246450006
to full-blown diabetes mellitus,|261015003|387085005|73211009|261015003|73211009
as well as
cardiovascular disease.[23]|49601007|264657009

Glycated hemoglobin|259689004
is
better|3442003
than fasting glucose|16985007|67079006|16985007|72191006
for determining risks|30207005
of cardiovascular disease|49601007
and
death|419620001|268923008
from any cause.[24]|134198009

Diabetes mellitus|73211009
is
a chronic disease|27624003
which
cannot
be
cured
except
in very specific situations.|260358002|69658003

Management|413454004|119270007
concentrates
on keeping blood sugar levels|33747003|365812005
as close|29179001
to normal|17621005|258744000
("euglycemia"
)
as possible,|371930009|60022001
without causing hypoglycemia.|23981006|271327008

This
can
usually
be
accomplished
with diet,|41829006
exercise,|61686008
and
use|277889008|419385000
of appropriate medications|410942007
(insulin|412222002
in the case|398241000
of type 1 diabetes,|46635009
oral medications,|260548002|410942007
as well as
possibly insulin,|60022001|412222002
in type 2 diabetes|44054006
).

Patient education,|311401005
understanding|66216009
,
and
participation
is
vital,|260410005
since
the complications|116223007
of diabetes|73211009
are
far less common|46053002|72906007
and
less severe|276139006|24484000|263796003|24484000
in people|125676002
who
have
well-managed blood sugar levels.|20572008|119270007|33747003|20572008|119270007|365812005

The goal|410518001
of treatment|276239002|416118004
is
an HbA1C level|258395000|276625007
of 6.5%,|260271001
but
should
not
be
lower|261122009
than
that,
and
may
be
set
higher.|75540009|371879000

Attention|6769007
is
also
paid
to other health problems|74964007|263775005|55607006
that
may
accelerate|14355007
the deleterious effects|253861007
of diabetes.|73211009

These
include|55919000
smoking,|365981007
elevated cholesterol levels,|13644009|258395000|75540009|275972003|75540009|365793008
obesity,|414915002
high blood pressure,|38341003
and
lack|41277001
of regular exercise.[27]|225925001

There
are
roles
for patient education,|311401005
dietetic support,|41829006|9096001|41829006|243114000
sensible exercise,|61686008
with the goal|410518001
of keeping
both
short-term
and
long-term blood glucose levels|365812005
within acceptable bounds.|75958009

In addition,|260364009
given|419582001
the associated higher risks|47429007|15508007
of cardiovascular disease,|49601007
lifestyle modifications|60134006|243326001
are
recommended
to
control|31509003
blood pressure.[28]|75367002|392570002|386536003

Metformin|372567009
is
generally
recommended
as a first line treatment|255216001|50009006|276239002|255216001|50009006|416118004|232714002|50009006|276239002|232714002|50009006|416118004
for type 2 diabetes,|44054006
as
there
is
good evidence|20572008|18669006
that
it
decreases|260370003
mortality.|409651001

Routine use|50811001|277889008|50811001|419385000
of aspirin,|387458008
however,
has
not
been
found|404684003
to
improve|385425000|3442003|385633008
outcomes|394617004
in uncomplicated diabetes.[30]|263914008|73211009

Type 1 diabetes|46635009
is
typically
treated|28995006
with a combinations|228166004
of regular|17854005
and
NPH insulin,|412219004
or
synthetic insulin analogs.|412222002

When
insulin|412222002
is
used|394850002
in type 2 diabetes,|44054006
a long-acting formulation|255511005
is
usually
added
initially,|884001
while
continuing|255238004
oral medications.|260548002|410942007

Doses|277406006
of insulin|412222002
are
then
increased|35105006|260366006
to effect.[29]|253861007

In countries|223369002
using|260676000
a general practitioner system,|59058001|246333005
such as the United Kingdom,|223860005
care
may
take|419652001
place|257557008|421066005
mainly
outside hospitals,
with hospital-based specialist care|309395003|309395003|418836005
used|394850002
only
in case|398241000
of complications,|116223007
difficult blood sugar control,|52925006|87612001|2331003|31509003|52925006|87612001|74801000|31509003|52925006|119273009|2331003|31509003|52925006|119273009|74801000|31509003
or
research projects.

In other circumstances,|74964007
general practitioners|59058001
and
specialists|309395003
share
care
of a patient|116154003
in a team approach.

Globally,
as of 2010[[update]]

,
an estimated 285 million people|414135002|125676002
had
diabetes,|73211009
with type 2 making|258195006
up about 90%|264705001|264703008
of the cases.|398241000|413769002

Its incidence
is
increasing|260369004
rapidly,|418694008
and
by 2030,
this number|410680006|410681005
is
estimated to almost|414135002
double.|1305003

Diabetes mellitus|73211009
occurs|272120004
throughout the world,
but
is
more common|242762006|72906007
(especially type 2|258195006
)
in the more developed countries.|242762006|223369002

The greatest increase|4757001|260366006
in prevalence
is
,
however,
expected
to
occur|272120004
in Asia|223500001
and
Africa,|223498002
where
most patients|116154003
will
probably
be
found|404684003
by 2030.

The increase|260366006
in incidence
in developing countries|223369002
follows|367409002
the trend|30294006
of urbanization
and
lifestyle changes,|60134006|243326001|60134006|263703002
perhaps most importantly
a "Western-style" diet.|41829006

This
has
suggested
an environmental|276339004
(i.e.,|42146005|22971001
dietary|41829006
)

but
there
is
little understanding|281411007|66216009|255507004|66216009
of the mechanism|257544000
(s)
at present,|52101004|246105001

is
much speculation,

Indigenous populations|385436007
in first world countries|255216001|223369002|232714002|223369002
have
a higher prevalence|75540009|371879000
and
increasing incidence|260369004
of diabetes|73211009
than their corresponding nonindigenous populations.|385436007

In Australia,|223621005
the age-standardised prevalence|424144002
of self-reported diabetes|229059009|73211009|223458004|73211009
in indigenous Australians
is
almost four|421534005

diabetes.|73211009

A 2010 study|110465008|224699009

even more.

The disease|64572001
affects|4065008
more
than 50 million Indians - 7.1%

The average age|424144002
on onset|77374008
is
42.5 years.|258707000

The high incidence|75540009|371879000
is
attributed|246061005
to a combination|89780004
of genetic susceptibility|47708004

in North America|223503004
have
been
increasing|260369004
substantially.

In 2010,
nearly 26 million people|125676002
have
diabetes|73211009
in the United States,|223688001
of whom 7 million people|125676002
remain
undiagnosed.

Another 57 million people|125676002
are
estimated|414135002
to
have
prediabetes.[41][42]

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|26216008|64572001|31509003|169443000
(CDC
)
has
termed
the
change|243326001|263703002
an epidemic.

The National Diabetes Information Clearinghouse|73211009
estimates|414135002
diabetes|73211009
costs
$132 billion
in the United States|223688001
alone|105529008
every year.|258707000|259039008

About 5%?10%|264706000|264605009
of diabetes cases|73211009|398241000|73211009|413769002
in North America|223503004
are
type 1,|258191002
with the rest|258157001
being
type 2.|258195006

The fraction|278277004
of type 1|258191002
in other parts|74964007|260726005
of the world
differs.

Most
of this difference|263735002
is
not currently|15240007
understood.|66216009

The American Diabetes Association (ADA) cites|73211009|263534001|73211009|272151006
the 2003 assessment|386053000
of the National Center|26216008
for Chronic Disease Prevention|27624003|169443000
and
Health Promotion|171434007
(Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|26216008|64572001|31509003|169443000
)
that one|421379005
in three Americans|421291004
born|106970005|81827009|398209006
after 2000
will
develop
diabetes|73211009
in their lifetimes.[44][45]

According to the ADA,
about 18.3%
(8.6 million
)
of Americans age 60|424144002
and
older|70753007
have
diabetes.|73211009

Diabetes mellitus prevalence|73211009
increases|260366006
with age,|424144002
and
the numbers|410680006|410681005
of older persons|70753007|125676002
with diabetes|73211009
are
expected
to
grow
as the elderly population|105436006|385436007|105436006|389109008
increases|260366006
in number.|410680006|410681005

The National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey|263775005|87276001|5880005|263775005|384759009|5880005
(NHANES III|257471003
)
demonstrated,
in the population|385436007|389109008
over 65 years old,|264695004|258707000|70753007
18%
to 20%
have
diabetes,|73211009
with 40%|259031006
having
either
diabetes|73211009
or
its precursor form|246176004
of impaired glucose tolerance.[47]|267426009

Diabetes|73211009
was
one|421379005
of the first diseases|255216001|64572001|232714002|64572001
described
,
[48]
with an Egyptian manuscript|297308004|1919006
from c.
1500 BCE mentioning "too great emptying|255509001|69251000|263768009|69251000
of the urine".|78014005

The first described cases|255216001|398241000|255216001|413769002|232714002|398241000|232714002|413769002
are
believed
to
be
of type 1 diabetes.|46635009

Indian physicians|309343006
around the same time|262126009|410669006
identified|7882003
the disease|64572001
and
classified|73504009
it
as
_madhumeha_
or
"honey urine",|227598003|78014005|421498008|78014005
noting
the urine|78014005
would
attract
ants.|106824004

The term "diabetes"|73211009
or
"to
pass
through"
was
first|255216001|232714002
used|394850002
in 230 BCE
by the Greek Appollonius|1451003
of Memphis.

The disease|64572001
was
considered
as rare|84638005|103356009
during the time|410669006
of the Roman empire,|223655008
with Galen commenting|34385009
he
had
only
seen two cases|420797005|398241000|420797005|413769002
during his career.

This
is
possibly due|60022001|42752001
the diet|41829006
and
life-style|60134006
of the ancient people,|125676002
or
because
the clinical symptoms|58147004
were
observed
during the advanced stage|86005002|21191007|86005002|371508000|86005002|261612004
of the disease.|64572001

Galen|34385009
named|27468005
the disease "diarrhea|64572001|398032003
of the urine"|78014005
(diarrhea urinosa|398032003
).

The earliest surviving work|264499004|261041009
with a detailed reference
to diabetes|73211009
is
that
of Aretaeus
of Cappadocia
(2nd|81170007
or
early 3rd c.|264499004|70905002

CE
).

He
described
the symptoms
and
the course|288524001
of the disease,|64572001
which
he
attributed|246061005
to the moisture|17461003
and
coldness,|64713002
reflecting|225436004
the beliefs
of the "Pneumatic School".|257698009

He
hypothesized
a correlation
of diabetes|73211009
with other diseases|74964007|64572001
and
he
discussed differential diagnosis|47965005
from the snakebite|238456006
which also
provokes|410658008
excessive thirst.|17173007

His work|261041009
remained
unknown|261665006
in the West
until the middle|255562008|399488007
of the 16th century
when
,
in 1552,
the first Latin edition|258238003
was
published
in Venice.[50]

Type 1|258191002
and
type 2 diabetes|44054006
where
identified|7882003
as separate conditions|263869007|260905004
for the first time|255216001|410669006|232714002|410669006
by the Indian physicians Sushruta|309343006
and
Charaka
in 400-500 CE
with type 1|258191002
associated|47429007
with youth|22396007
and
type 2|258195006
with
being
overweight.|238131007

The term "mellitus"
or
"
from honey"|227598003|421498008
was
added
by the Briton John Rolle
in the late 1700s to|260383002
separate|263869007
the condition|260905004
from diabetes insipidus,|15771004|45369008
which
is
also
associated|47429007
with frequent urination.|162116003

Effective treatment|255403003|276239002|255403003|416118004|254648000|276239002|254648000|416118004
was
not
developed
until the early part|264499004|260726005
of the 20th century,
when
Canadians Frederick Banting
and
Charles Herbert Best|20572008|3442003
isolated|46651001
and
purified insulin|412222002
in 1921
and
1922.

This
was
followed|367409002
by the development|278923009
of the long-acting insulin NPH|25305005|30753002
in the 1940s.[49]

The word _diabetes_|255373000|73211009
(!
play|300776002
/?da?.??bi?ti?z/
or
/?da?.??bi?t?s/
comes
from Latin _diab?t?s_,
which in turn|282987006
comes
from Ancient Greek ????????|1451003
(_diab?t?s_
)
which literally means "|255586005
a passer|421485004
through
;
a siphon."[51] Ancient Greek physician Aretaeus|1451003|309343006
of Cappadocia
(fl.
1st century CE|255216001
used|394850002
that word,|255373000
with the intended meaning "excessive discharge|361269008|260378005|307488001|361269008|260378005|58000006
of urine",|78014005
as
the name
for the disease.|64572001

Ultimately,
the word|255373000
comes
from Greek ??????????|1451003
(_diabainein_
)
,
meaning|255586005
"to
pass
through,
"[51]
which
is
composed
of ???-
(_dia_-|128787000
)
,
meaning|255586005
"
through"
and ???????
(_bainein_
)
,
meaning|255586005
"to
go
".

The word "diabetes"|255373000|73211009
is
first|255216001|232714002
recorded
in English,|297487008|25804004
in the form _diabete_,|246176004
in a medical text|74188005
written|12261009
around 1425.

The word _mellitus_|255373000
(/m??la?t?s/
or
/?m?l?t?s/
comes
from the classical Latin word _mell?tus_,|255333006|255373000|260997001|255373000
meaning|255586005
"mellite"[54]
(i.e.|42146005|22971001

sweetened
with honey|227598003|421498008
;[54] honey-sweet[55]|227598003|227620005|264691008|421498008|227620005|264691008
).

The Latin word|255373000
comes
from _mell_-,
which
comes
from _mel_,
meaning|255586005
"honey"|227598003|421498008
;[54][55] sweetness|264691008|227620005
;[55] pleasant thing,|264691008
[55]|264691008
and
the suffix -_?tus_,
[54]
whose meaning
is
the same|262126009
as that
of the English suffix "-ite".|297487008|25804004

It
was
Thomas Willis
who
in 1675 added "mellitus"
to the word "diabetes"|255373000|73211009
as
a designation|118522005
for the disease,|64572001
when
he
noticed
the urine|78014005
of a diabetic
had
a sweet taste|227620005|76489005
(glycosuria.|45154002

This sweet taste|227620005|76489005
had
been
noticed
in urine|78014005
by the ancient Greeks,|1451003
Chinese,|297876005|33897005
Egyptians,|1919006
Indians,
and
Persians.

The 1990 "[St.

Vincent Declaration]
(/wiki/St._Vincent_Declaration
)
"[57][58]
was
the result|394617004
of international efforts to|19487008
improve|385425000|3442003|385633008
the care
accorded
to those with diabetes.|20401003|73211009|421463005|73211009

Doing
so
is
important
not only
in terms
of quality|263496004
of life|224130005
and
life expectancy,|224130005|410517006
but
also economically?expenses
due to diabetes|73211009
have
been
shown
to
be
a major drain|255603008|32712000
on health-|263775005
and
productivity-related resources|272151006|262094002
for healthcare systems|246333005
and
governments.

Several countries|261028005|223369002
established|263748003|385645004
more
and
less successful national diabetes|276139006|385669000|73211009|263796003|385669000|73211009
programmes
to
improve|385425000|3442003|385633008
treatment|276239002|416118004
of the disease.[59]|64572001

Diabetic patients|116154003
with neuropathic symptoms|386033004
such as numbness|398026008|44077006
or
tingling|162249002
in feet|56459004|259051005
or
hands|85562004
are
twice|421832002
as
likely to|2931005
be
unemployed|73438004
as those without the symptoms.[60]|45169001

In animals,|387961004
diabetes|73211009
is
most commonly|4757001
encountered
in dogs|448771007
and
cats.|448169003|388618001

Middle-aged animals|28288005|387961004
are
most commonly|4757001
affected.|247591002|248448006

Female dogs|248152002|448771007|248152002|224526002|448771007|224526002
are
twice|421832002
as
likely to|2931005
be
affected|247591002|248448006
as males,|248153007
while
according to some sources,|260753009
male cats|248153007|448169003|248153007|388618001
are
also more prone|1240000
than females.|248152002

In
both
species,|69658003
all breeds
may
be
affected|247591002|248448006
,
but
some small dog breeds|255507004|448771007|255507004
are
particularly likely to|2931005
develop
diabetes,|73211009
such as Miniature Poodles.|40121001

The symptoms
may
relate|272151006|262094002
to fluid loss|251846002
and
polyuria,|28442001
but
the course|288524001
may
also
be
insidious.|367562006

Diabetic animals|387961004
are
more prone|242762006|1240000
to infections.

The long-term complications|116223007
recognised
in humans|278412004
are
much rarer|242762006|84638005|242762006|103356009|4757001|84638005|4757001|103356009
in animals.|387961004

The principles
of treatment|276239002|416118004
(weight loss,|89362005
oral antidiabetics,|260548002|384953001

and

of emergencies|25876001
(e.g.|258795003

ketoacidosis|2538008|56051008
