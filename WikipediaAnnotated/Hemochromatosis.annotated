In medicine,|410942007
*
*iron overload|60737008
*
*
indicates|410535002
accumulation
of iron|3829006
in the body|279495008|123037004
from any cause.|134198009

The most important causes|4757001|134198009
are
*
*hereditary haemochromatosis** (HHC),|399170009
a genetic disorder,|32895009
and
transfusional iron overload,|60737008|303955003|60737008|116859006|60737008|5447007|60737008
which
can
result|394617004
from repeated blood transfusion.|27582007

Historically,
the term
*
*haemochromatosis|399187006
*
*
(spelled|83166007
*
*hemochromatosis|399187006
*
*
in American English|297487008|25804004
was
initially|884001
used|394850002
to
refer|439980006
to what
is
now more specifically called haemochromatosis type 1|399187006|258191002
(
or
HFE-related hereditary haemochromatosis|272151006|399170009|262094002|399170009
).

Currently,|15240007
haemochromatosis|399187006
(
without further specification|46053002
)
is
mostly
defined
as iron overload|60737008
with a hereditary/primary cause,|255404009|63161005|23981006|255404009|63161005|134198009|255404009|261424001|23981006|255404009|261424001|134198009
[1][2]|303183002
or
originating
from a metabolic disorder.|30390004

However,
the term
is
currently also|15240007
used|394850002
more broadly to|242762006
refer|439980006
to any form|246176004
of iron overload,|60737008
thus
requiring
specification
of the cause,|134198009
for example,
_hereditary haemochromatosis_.|399170009

Hereditary haemochromatosis|399170009
is
an autosomal recessive disorder|258211005|64572001
with estimated prevalence|414135002
in the population|385436007|389109008
of 1
in 200
among patients|116154003
with European ancestry,|414152003
with lower incidence|261122009
in other ethnic groups.|74964007|397731000

The gene|67271001
responsible|394851003
for hereditary haemochromatosis|399170009
(
known|36692007
as HFE gene|67271001
)
is
located
on chromosome 6|45202000
;
the majority
of hereditary haemochromatosis patients|399170009|116154003
have
mutations|55446002
in this HFE gene.|67271001

Hereditary haemochromatosis|399170009
is
characterized
by an accelerated rate|14355007
of intestinal iron absorption|38597004|3829006
and
progressive iron deposition|255314001|84182002
in various tissues|256220008|85756007
that typically
begins|255395001
to
be
expressed
in the third|70905002
to fifth decades|32088001
of life,|224130005
but
may
occur|272120004
in children.|410601007|160499008

The most common presentation|4757001|72906007|246105001
is
hepatic cirrhosis|19943007
in combination|89780004
with hypopituitarism,|74728003
cardiomyopathy,|57809008
diabetes,|73211009
arthritis,|3723001
or
hyperpigmentation.|49765009

Because of the severe sequelae|24484000|302049001
of this disorder|64572001
if
left untreated,|7771000|25265005
and
recognizing
that treatment|276239002|416118004
is
relatively simple, early diagnosis|13673007|264499004|439401001|13673007|264499004
before symptoms
or
signs|72670004
appear
is
important.

In general,|60132005
the term
*
*haemosiderosis|39011001
*
*
is
used to|394850002
indicate|410535002
the pathological effect|394595002|253861007|29458008|253861007
of iron accumulation|3829006
in any given organ,|410653004
which mainly
occurs|272120004
in the form|246176004
of haemosiderin.|70748002

Sometimes,
the simpler term|13673007
*
*siderosis|62371005
*
*
is
used instead.|394850002

Other definitions|74964007
distinguishing
haemochromatosis|399187006
or
haemosiderosis|39011001
that
are
occasionally
used|394850002
include|55919000
:

Organs commonly|410653004
affected|247591002|248448006
by haemochromatosis|399187006
are
the liver,|10200004|181268008
heart,|80891009|302509004
and
endocrine glands.[15]|387910009

Haemochromatosis|399187006
may
present|52101004|246105001
with the following clinical syndromes|255260001|58147004
:
[16]

The causes|134198009
can
be
distinguished
between primary cases|63161005|398241000|63161005|413769002|261424001|398241000|261424001|413769002
(hereditary|255404009
or
genetically
determined
)
and
less frequent secondary cases|276139006|70232002|2603003|398241000|276139006|70232002|2603003|413769002|276139006|70232002|81170007|398241000|276139006|70232002|81170007|413769002|263796003|70232002|2603003|398241000|263796003|70232002|2603003|413769002|263796003|70232002|81170007|398241000|263796003|70232002|81170007|413769002
(
acquired|255396000
during life|224130005
).

People|125676002
of Celtic
(Irish,
Scottish,
Welsh,|14999008
Cornish,
Breton etc.
)
origin|255395001
have
a particularly high incidence|75540009|371879000
of whom about 10%
are
carriers|47461006
of the gene|67271001
and
1% sufferers|260305007
from the condition.|260905004

The fact
that
most cases|398241000|413769002
of haemochromatosis|399187006
were
inherited|255404009
was
well known|20572008|36692007
for most
of the 20th century,
though
they
were
incorrectly
assumed
to
depend
on a single gene.|125681006|67271001|50607009|67271001

The overwhelming majority actually
depend
on mutations|55446002
of the HFE gene|67271001
discovered
in 1996,
but
since then others
have
been
discovered
and
sometimes
are
grouped|255504006
together
as "non-classical hereditary haemochromatosis",|255333006|399170009|260997001|399170009
[20] "non-HFE
related|272151006|262094002
hereditary haemochromatosis",|399170009
[21]
or
"non-HFE haemochromatosis".[22]|399187006

Most types|261664005
of hereditary haemochromatosis|399170009
have
autosomal recessive inheritance,|258211005
while
type 4|258201003
has
autosomal dominant inheritance.[23]|263681008|264657009

There
are
several methods|261028005|260686004|261028005|272394005
available|103328004
for diagnosing|439401001
and
monitoring iron loading|302805002|3829006
including|55919000
:

Serum ferritin|269821003
is
a low-cost, readily available,|62482003|103328004|371880002|103328004
and
minimally invasive method|10179008|260686004|10179008|272394005
for assessing body iron stores.|279495008|264311001|123037004|264311001

However,
the major problem|255603008|55607006
with
using|260676000
it
as
an indicator
of iron overload|60737008
is
that
it
can
be
elevated|75540009
in a range
of other medical conditions|74964007|74188005|260905004
unrelated|262241003
to iron levels|42950004
including|55919000
infection,
inflammation,|257552002
fever,|386661006
liver disease,|235856003
renal disease,|90708001
and
cancer.|363346000|372087000

Also,
total iron binding capacity|117173006|359979000
may
be
low,|62482003|371880002
but
can
also
be
normal.[24]|17621005|258744000

The standard
of practice
in diagnosis|439401001
of haemochromatosis|399187006
was
recently|6493001
reviewed
by Pietrangelo.

Positive HFE analysis|258758003|272389005|10828004|272389005
confirms|59156000
the clinical diagnosis|39154008
of haemochromatosis|399187006
in asymptomatic individuals|84387000|125676002|84387000|385435006
with blood tests|252275004
showing
increased iron stores,|35105006|264311001|260366006|264311001
or
for predictive testing|272393004
of individuals|125676002|385435006
with a family history|57177007
of haemochromatosis.|399187006

The alleles|9109004
evaluated
by HFE gene analysis|67271001|272389005
are
evident|18669006
in ~80%
of patients|116154003
with haemochromatosis|399187006
;
a negative report|260385009|229059009|260385009|223458004
for HFE gene|67271001
does
not
rule|10828004
out haemochromatosis.|255529000|399187006

In a patient|116154003
with negative HFE gene testing,|260385009|67271001|260385009|67271001|272393004
elevated iron status|75540009|3829006|263490005
for no other obvious reason,|74964007|410666004
and
family history|57177007
of liver disease,|235856003
additional evaluation|260364009|260364009|386053000
of liver iron concentration|10200004|3829006|82742001|181268008|3829006|82742001
is
indicated.|410535002

In this case,|398241000
diagnosis|439401001
of haemochromatosis|399187006
is
based|418836005
on biochemical analysis|80534008|272389005
and
histologic examination|67151002|5880005
of a liver biopsy.|86259008

Assessment|386053000
of the hepatic iron index (HII)|32381004|3829006|419205000
is
considered
the "gold standard"|2309006|371256005
for diagnosis|439401001
of haemochromatosis.|399187006

MRI|113091000
is
emerging
as an alternative
to liver biopsy|86259008
for measuring liver iron loading.|258104002|10200004|3829006|258104002|181268008|3829006|263571004|10200004|3829006|263571004|181268008|3829006

For measuring liver iron concentrations,|258104002|10200004|3829006|82742001|258104002|181268008|3829006|82742001|263571004|10200004|3829006|82742001|263571004|181268008|3829006|82742001
*
*R2-MRI|113091000
*
*
(also
known|36692007
as
*
*FerriScan
*
*
)
[25][26]
has
been
extensively
validated.

More
than 11,000 FerriScans
have
now
been
conducted|844005
in over 120 medical centres|21481007|288565001
across 25 countries.|223369002

FerriScan
is
now specifically
recommended
as a method to|260686004|272394005
measure|246445000|272391002
liver iron concentrations|10200004|3829006|82742001|181268008|3829006|82742001
in clinical practice guidelines|58147004
for thalassaemias,|40108008
[27][28][29][30][31] sickle cell disease [32][33][34] myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) [35][36][37]|264664006|417357006|64572001|264667004|264664006|417357006|264667004
and
hereditary haemochromatosis.[38]|399170009|264670000

Family members|303071001
of those
diagnosed|439401001
with primary haemochromatosis|399170009
may
be
advised|424900004
to
be
screened|20135006|360156006
genetically to
determine
if
they
are
a carrier|47461006|29679002
or
if
they
could
develop
the disease.|64572001

This
can
allow
preventative measures to|246445000|367346004
be
taken.|419652001

A third|70905002
of those untreated|25265005
develop
hepatocellular carcinoma.[39]|187769009

Routine treatment|50811001|276239002|50811001|416118004
in an otherwise-healthy person|263775005|125676002
consists
of regularly scheduled phlebotomies|416151008|396540005|416774000|396540005
(bloodletting.|127606004

When
first
diagnosed,|439401001
the phlebotomies|396540005
may
be
fairly frequent, perhaps|70232002
as
often|70232002
as
once
a week,|258705008|259038000
until
iron levels|42950004
can
be
brought|68369002
to within normal range.|260395002

Once iron|3829006
and
other markers|74964007
are
within the normal range,|260395002
phlebotomies|396540005
may
be
scheduled|416151008|416774000
every other month|74964007|258706009|74964007|259036001
or
every three months|421291004|258706009
depending
upon the patient's rate|116154003
of iron loading.|3829006

For those unable to|371151008
tolerate
routine blood draws,|50811001|396540005
there
is
a chelating agent|372627001
available|103328004
for use.|277889008|419385000

The drug Deferoxamine|410942007|372825006
binds|257768005
with iron|3829006
in the bloodstream
and
enhances
its elimination|63911002
via urine|78014005
and
faeces.|39477002

Typical treatment|276239002|416118004
for chronic iron overload|90734009|60737008
requires
subcutaneous injection|32282008
over a period|259037005
of 8?12 hours daily.|123034006|69620002|259028005|69620002|123035007|69620002

Two newer iron chelating drugs|420797005|7147002|95977000|410942007
that
are
licensed
for use|277889008|419385000
in patients|116154003
receiving
regular blood transfusions to|17854005
treat|395077000
