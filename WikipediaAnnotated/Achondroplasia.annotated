(!
play|300776002
/??k?ndr??ple?zi?/|258337006
is
a common cause|72906007|134198009
of dwarfism.|237837007

It
occurs|272120004
as a sporadic mutation|75741005|55446002
in approximately 75%|26175008
of cases|398241000|413769002
(
associated|47429007
with advanced paternal age|105436006|224944003|86005002|20587003
)
or
may
be
inherited|255404009
as an autosomal dominant genetic disorder.|263681008|32895009

Achondroplastic dwarfs|86268005
have
short stature,|237837007
with an average adult height|133936004
of 131 centimeters|258672001
(51.5 inches|258677007
)
for males|248153007
and
123 centimeters|258672001
(48.4 inches|258677007
)
for females.|248152002

Achondroplastic adults|86268005|133936004
are
known|36692007
to
be
as short|359530003|367450005
as 62.8 cm
(24.7 inches|258677007
).

The disorder|64572001
itself
is
caused|23981006|134198009
by a change|243326001|263703002
in the DNA|24851008
for fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3),|88919005|116647005
which
causes|134198009
an abnormality|276654001
of cartilage formation.|116335008

If
both
parents|40683002
of a child|410601007|160499008
have
achondroplasia,|86268005
and
both parents|40683002
pass
on the mutant gene,|67271001
then
it
is
very unlikely|260358002
that
the homozygous child|22061001|410601007|22061001|160499008
will
live|419749002
past|410513005
a few months|57176003|258706009
of its life.|224130005

The prevalence
is
approximately 1|26175008
in 25,000.[1]

In normal figures,|17621005|258744000
FGFR3
has
a negative regulatory effect|260385009|253861007
on bone growth.|272673000|3138006|90780006|128530007

In achondroplasia,|86268005
the mutated form|55446002|246176004
of the receptor|116647005
is
constitutively active|55561003
and
this
leads|88488004|236874000
to severely shortened bones.|24484000|298353004

People|125676002
with achondroplasia|86268005
have
one normal copy|421379005|17621005|421379005|258744000
of the FGFR3 gene|67271001
and
one mutant copy.|421379005

Two copies|420797005
of the mutant gene|67271001
are
invariably fatal|399166001
before
or
shortly after birth.|3950001

Only one|50607009|421379005|420295001|421379005
copy
of the gene|67271001
has
to
be
present|52101004|246105001
for the condition to|260905004
occur.|272120004

Therefore,
a person|125676002
with achondroplasia|86268005
has
a 50% chance
of passing
on the gene|67271001
to his
or
her offspring,|160499008
meaning|255586005
that there
will
be
a 50% chance
that
each child|410601007|160499008
will
have
achondroplasia.|86268005

Since
it
is
fatal to|399166001
have
two copies|420797005
(homozygous|22061001
)
,
if
two people|420797005|125676002
with achondroplasia|86268005
have
a child,|410601007|160499008
there
is
a 25% chance
of the child|410601007|160499008
dying|399069006
shortly after birth,|3950001
a 50% chance
the child|410601007|160499008
will
have
achondroplasia,|86268005
and
a 25% chance
the child|410601007|160499008
will
have
an average phenotype.|8116006|363778006

People|125676002
with achondroplasia|86268005
can
be
born|106970005|81827009|398209006
to parents|40683002
that
do
not
have
the condition.|260905004

This
is
the result|394617004
of a new mutation.[2]|7147002|55446002

New gene mutations|7147002|67271001|55446002
leading|236874000
to achondroplasia|86268005
are
associated|47429007
with increasing paternal age[3]|260369004|20587003
(over 35 years old|21481007|258707000|70753007
).

Studies|110465008|224699009
have
demonstrated
that new gene mutations|7147002|67271001|55446002
for achondroplasia|86268005
are
exclusively
inherited|255404009
from the father|66839005
and
occur|272120004
during spermatogenesis|20412003
;
it
is
theorized
that oogenesis|60279001
has
some regulatory mechanism|257544000
that
hinders
the mutation|55446002
from originally
occurring|272120004
in females|248152002
(
although
females|248152002
are
still readily able to|371150009
inherit|255404009
and
pass
on the mutant allele|9109004
).

More
than 99%
of achondroplasia|86268005
is
caused|23981006|134198009
by two different mutations|420797005|263735002|55446002
in the FGFR3.

In about 98%
of cases,|398241000|413769002
a G|258795003
to A point mutation|55446002
at nucleotide 1138|71211001
of the FGFR3 gene|67271001
causes|134198009
a glycine|15331006|47390004
to arginine substitution|52625008
(Bellus
et
al.

1995,
Shiang
et
al.

1994,
Rousseau
et
al.

1996
).

About 1%|260305007
of cases|398241000|413769002
are
caused|23981006|134198009
by a G|258795003
to C point mutation|55446002
at nucleotide 1138.|71211001

The mutant gene|67271001
was
discovered
by John Wasmuth
and
his colleagues
in 1994.

There
are
two other syndromes|420797005
with a genetic basis|3950001|3950001|418836005|255395001|255395001|418836005
similar
to achondroplasia|86268005
:
hypochondroplasia|205468002
and
thanatophoric dysplasia.|29352008

Or
it
could
just
be
a birth defect.|276654001|276720006

Achondroplasia|86268005
can
be
detected|260373001
before birth|3950001
by the use|277889008|419385000
of prenatal ultrasound.|359659005

A DNA test|24851008|269814003|24851008|24851008|272393004
can
be
performed|398166005
before birth to|3950001
detect|260373001
homozygosity,|22061001
wherein
two copies|420797005
of the mutant gene|67271001
are
inherited|255404009
,
a lethal condition|260905004
leading|236874000
to stillbirths.|237364002

A skeletal survey|45732007
is
useful to
confirm|59156000
the diagnosis|439401001
of achondroplasia.|86268005

The skull|89546000
is
large,|255509001
with a narrow foramen magnum,|18043004|24532009|18043004|244679008|25659002|24532009|25659002|244679008|134223000|24532009|134223000|244679008
and
relatively small skull base.|271611007|255507004|31467002

The vertebral bodies|3572006
are
short|359530003|367450005
and
flattened
with relatively large intervertebral disk height,|255509001|360499006|255509001|244570000
and
there
is
congenitally
narrowed|134223000
spinal canal.|61853006

The iliac wings|22356005|53036007
are
small|255507004
and
squared|56924007
,
[4]|260308009
with a narrow sciatic notch|18043004|360956007|25659002|360956007|134223000|360956007
and
horizontal acetabular roof.|24020000|37783008|224738009|24020000|182027007|224738009

The tubular bones|95568003|272673000|95568003|128530007|13336003|272673000|13336003|128530007
are
short|359530003|367450005
and
thick|246703001
with metaphyseal cupping|33251002|231097002
and
flaring
and
irregular growth plates.|49608001|84349008

Fibular overgrowth|87342007
is
present.|52101004|246105001

The hand|85562004|302539009
is
broad|90522003
with short metacarpals|359530003|36455000|367450005|36455000
and
phalanges,|73696005
and
a trident configuration.|103377007

The ribs|113197003
are
short|359530003|367450005
with cupped anterior ends.|231097002|255549009|261782000|415183006|255549009|261782000|428178003|255549009|261782000

If
the radiographic features|258106000
are
not classic,|255301002|255333006
a search
for a different diagnosis|47965005
should
be
entertained.

Because of the extremely
deformed
bone structure,|272673000
people|125676002
with achondroplasia|86268005
are
often "double jointed".|70232002|1305003|39352004|70232002|1305003|81087007|70232002|1305003|302536002

The diagnosis|439401001
can
be
made
by fetal ultrasound|359659005
by progressive discordance|255314001
between the femur length|396551005
and
biparietal diameter|281688001
by age.|424144002

The trident hand configuration|249755001|103377007
can
be
seen
if
the fingers|7569003|259052003
are
fully
extended.|255536004|288467006|255590007

Another distinct characteristic
of the syndrome
is
thoracolumbar gibbus|264232007|414564002
in infancy.|3658006

At present,|52101004|246105001
there
is
no known treatment|36692007|276239002|36692007|416118004
for achondroplasia,|86268005
even
though
the cause|134198009
of the mutation|55446002
in the growth factor receptor|81286007|116647005
has
been
found.|404684003

Although
used|394850002
by those without achondroplasia to|45169001|86268005
aid|246088000
in growth,|52101004|18720000
human growth hormone|395883003
does
not
help
people|125676002
with achondroplasia.|86268005

However,
if
desired
,
the controversial surgery|83578000
of limb-lengthening|66019005|129349004|243996003|129349004
will
lengthen|358612008|129349004
the legs|30021000
and
arms|40983000
of someone
with achondroplasia.[5]|86268005

Usually,
the best results|394617004
appear
within the first|255216001|232714002
and
second year|81170007|258707000|81170007|259039008|257997001|258707000|257997001|259039008|288495006|258707000|288495006|259039008
of therapy.|276239002

After the second year|81170007|258707000|81170007|259039008|257997001|258707000|257997001|259039008|288495006|258707000|288495006|259039008
of GH therapy,|276239002
beneficial bone growth decreases.|272673000|260370003|3138006|260370003|90780006|260370003|128530007|260370003

Therefore,
GH therapy|276239002
is
not
a satisfactory long term treatment.[6]|276239002|416118004

Gene|67271001
based|418836005
therapy|276239002
is
on the horizon.

recently|6493001
announced
the initiation|312009002

Achondroplasia|86268005
is
one|421379005
of 19 congenital conditions|6160004|260905004|255399007|260905004
with similar presentations,|246105001
such as osteogenesis imperfecta,|78314001
multiple epiphyseal dysplasia tarda,|59708000|263895009
achondrogenesis,|2391001
osteopetrosis,|1926006
and
thanatophoric dysplasia.|29352008

This
makes
estimates|414135002
of prevalence
difficult,|52925006
with changing|243326001|263703002
and
subjective diagnostic criteria|255362007|439401001|255362007|261004008
over time.|410669006

One|421379005
detailed
and
long-running study|255511005|418060005|110465008|255511005|418060005|224699009
in the Netherlands|223672001
found|404684003
that
the prevalence
determined
at birth|3950001
was
only 1.3|50607009|420295001
per 100,000 live births.|281050002

However,
another study|110465008|224699009
at the same time|262126009|410669006
found|404684003
a rate
of 1
per 10,000.[8]

Based|418836005
on their disproportionate dwarfism,|32453009|237837007
some dog|448771007
breeds
traditionally
have
been
classified|73504009
as "achondroplastic."|86268005
This
is
the case|398241000
for the dachshund,|2062007
basset hound,|41320000
and
bulldog breeds,|38184008
to
mention
a few.|57176003

Data
from whole genome association|260232004|18470003|263534001|260232004|18470003|272151006
studies|110465008|224699009
in short-limbed dogs|359530003|66019005|448771007|359530003|66019005|359530003|243996003|448771007|359530003|243996003|367450005|66019005|448771007|367450005|66019005|367450005|243996003|448771007|367450005|243996003
reveal|263857004
a strong association|260404005|263534001|260404005|272151006
of this trait
with a retro-gene coding|255551008|67271001
for fibroblast growth factor 4 FGF4.|88919005

Therefore,
it
seems
unlikely
that dogs|448771007
and
humans|278412004
are
achondroplastic|86268005
for the same reasons.|262126009|410666004

However,
histological studies|67151002|110465008|67151002|224699009
in some achondroplastic dog breeds|86268005|448771007|86268005
have
shown
altered
cell patterns|4421005|272135003|362837007|272135003
in cartilage|61496007
that
are
very similar|260358002
to those
observed
in humans|278412004
exhibiting
achondroplasia.[12]|86268005

A similar form|246176004
of achondroplasia|86268005
was
found|404684003
in a litter|370553007
of piglets
from a phenotypically normal Danish sow.|17621005|258744000

The dwarfism|237837007
was
inherted
dominant
in the offspring|160499008
from this litter.|370553007

The mutants
were
born|106970005|81827009|398209006
phenotypically normal|17621005|258744000
but
became
more
and
