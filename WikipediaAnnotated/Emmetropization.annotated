(
from Greek _emmetros_,|1451003
"well-proportioned"|20572008|8212001
or
"fitting"|122467006
)
describes
the state|398070004
of vision|281004000
where an object|260787004
at infinity
is
in sharp focus|410707003|87017008|410707003|363702006
with the eye lens|78076003
in a neutral
or
relaxed state.|15166001|398070004

This condition|260905004
of the normal eye|17621005|81745001|17621005|244486005|258744000|81745001|258744000|244486005
is
achieved
when
the refractive power|251718005
of the cornea|28726007|181162001
and
the axial length|24422004|410668003
of the eye balance out,|81745001|249982003|81745001|78933003|81745001|282295000|244486005|249982003|244486005|78933003|244486005|282295000
which
focuses|251776000|87017008|363702006
rays exactly|107315007|82107009
on the retina,|5665001|181171005
resulting|42752001
in perfect vision.|281004000

An eye|81745001|244486005
in a state|398070004
of emmetropia|45089002
requires
no correction.

Emmetropia|45089002
is
a state|398070004
in which
the eye|81745001|244486005
is
relaxed|15166001
and
focused|87017008|363702006
on an object more|260787004
than 6 meters|419493001
or
20 feet away.|419493001

The light rays|56242006|107315007|56242006|82107009|371268001|107315007|371268001|82107009
coming
from
that object|260787004
are
essentially
parallel
,
and
the rays|107315007|82107009
are
focused|87017008|363702006
on the retina|5665001|181171005
without effort|19487008
(
an emmetropic eye|45089002|81745001|45089002|244486005
does
not
need|410525008|103325001
corrective lenses.|78076003|181169005

If
the gaze|246772007
shifts|9546005
to something closer, light rays|29179001|56242006|107315007|29179001|56242006|82107009|29179001|371268001|107315007|29179001|371268001|82107009
from the source|260753009
are
too divergent to|263741009
be
focused|87017008|363702006
without effort.|19487008

In other words,|74964007|255373000
the eye|81745001|244486005
is
automatically
focused|87017008|363702006
on things
in the distance|246132006
unless
a conscious effort|19487008
is
made
to focus elsewhere.|87017008|363702006

For a wild animal|262290003|387961004
or
human prehistorical ancestors,|278412004
this arrangement|103377007
would
be
adaptive
because
it
allows
for alertness
to predators
or
prey
at a distance.|246132006

Accommodation|251776000
of the lens|78076003|181169005
does
not
occur|272120004
in emmetropia.|45089002

In emmetropia,|45089002
the lens|78076003|181169005
is
about 3.6 mm
thick|246703001
at the center|26216008
;
in accommodation,|251776000
it
thickens|263899003
to about 4.5 mm.

A relatively thin lens|18043004|78076003|18043004|181169005
and
relatively dilated pupil|37125009
are
also
associated.|47429007

The lens usually|78076003|181169005
stiffens
with age,|424144002
causing|23981006
less ability|276139006|371150009|263796003|371150009
to focus|87017008|363702006
when
the eyes|81745001
are
not
in a state|398070004
of emmetropia.[1]|45089002

Corrective eye surgery|422191005
such as LASIK|312965008
and
PRK
aims
to correct anemmetropic vision.|281004000

This
is
accomplished
by ensuring
the curvature
of the cornea,|28726007|181162001
the shape|107644003|246176004|300842002
of the lens|78076003|181169005
and
their distances|246132006
from each other
and
the retina|5665001|181171005
are
in harmony.

By shaping|107644003|300842002
the cornea,|28726007|181162001
emmetropic vision|45089002|281004000
can
be
achieved
without corrective lenses.|78076003|181169005

The correction
for only emmetropic vision|50607009|45089002|281004000|420295001|45089002|281004000
is
often|70232002
why
patients|116154003
are
still
advised to|424900004
wear
glasses to|50121007
read|50360004
as
they age|424144002
due to presbyopia.[2]|41256004

Newborns|133933007
begin|255395001
hypermetropic|38101003
and
then
undergo
a myopic shift to|9546005
become
emmetropic.|45089002

"Emmetropia"|45089002
is
ultimately
derived
from Greek _en_/_em_ ("|1451003
in"
)
+ _metron_
("measure,|246445000|272391002
"
not to
be
confused|286933003
with _metr-_/_meter_ "mother"|258669008|72705000
)
+ _op_[_s_/_t_]-
("eye"|81745001|244486005
)
+ -_ia_
("condition"|260905004
).

Translated
literally,
the term
indicates|410535002
the condition|260905004
of an eye's|81745001|244486005
having
in itself
(_i.e._,|42146005|22971001
without recourse
to corrective lenses|78076003|181169005
or
other instruments|74964007|57134006
)
the capability to
obtain|398092000
an accurate measurement|263656005|272391002
of an object's physical appearance.|260787004|5880005|386548000|260787004|5880005|255412001|260787004|19388002|386548000|260787004|19388002|255412001
