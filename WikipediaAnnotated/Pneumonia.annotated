*Pneumonia|205237003
*
*
is
an inflammatory condition|260905004
of the lung?|39607008|181216001
affecting|247591002|248448006
primarily
the microscopic air sacs|84496004|49081009
known|36692007
as alveoli.

It
is
usually
caused|23981006|134198009
by infection
with viruses|49872002
or
bacteria|409822003
and
less commonly other microorganisms,|276139006|264395009|263796003|264395009
certain drugs|17162000|410942007
and
other conditions|74964007|260905004
such as autoimmune diseases.[1][3]|85828009

Typical symptoms
include|55919000
a cough,|272039006
chest pain,|29857009
fever,|386661006
and
difficulty breathing.|267036007

Diagnostic tools|439401001|86967005|261004008|86967005
include|55919000
x-rays|52250000|168537006
and
culture|252398009|61594008
of the sputum.|45710003

Vaccines to|398827000
prevent
certain types|17162000|261664005
of pneumonia|205237003
are
available.|103328004

Treatment|276239002|416118004
depends
on the underlying cause.|134198009

Presumed bacterial pneumonia|53084003
is
treated|28995006
with antibiotics.|255631004

If
the pneumonia|205237003
is
severe,|24484000
the affected person|247591002|125676002|248448006|125676002
is
generally
admitted|32485007
to hospital.|285201006

Pneumonia|205237003
affects|4065008
approximately 450 million people|26175008|125676002
a year|258707000|259039008
and
results|394617004
in about 4 million deaths|419620001|268923008
(7%
of the world's total|258755000|255619001
).

Although
pneumonia|205237003
was
regarded
by William Osler
in the 19th century
as "
the captain
of the men|339947000
of death",|419620001|268923008
[5]|264706000|264605009
the advent
of antibiotic therapy|281789004
and
vaccines|398827000
in the 20th century
has
seen
improvements
in survival.

Nevertheless,
in developing countries,|223369002
and
among the very old,|260358002|70753007
the very young|260358002|84422007
and
the chronically ill, pneumonia|367391008|205237003
remains
a leading cause|236874000|134198009
of death.[6][7]|419620001|268923008

People|125676002
with infectious pneumonia often|205237003|70232002
have
a productive cough,|28743005
fever|386661006
accompanied
by shaking chills,|43724002|248457000
shortness|359530003|367450005
of breath,|11891009
sharp|410707003
or
stabbing chest pain|55145008|261179002|242879005|29857009|410706007|29857009
during deep breaths,|181893002
and
an increased respiratory rate.|271823003

In the elderly,|105436006
confusion|286933003
may
be
the most prominent sign.|4757001|4657009|72670004

The typical signs|72670004
and
symptoms
in children|410601007|160499008
under five|421820001
are
fever,|386661006
cough,|272039006
and
fast|16985007|277748003
or
difficult breathing.[10]|267036007

Fever|386661006
is
not very specific,|260358002|69658003
as
it
occurs|272120004
in many other common illnesses,|74964007|72906007|39104002
and
may
be
absent|2667000
in those with severe disease|20401003|24484000|64572001|421463005|24484000|64572001
or
malnutrition.|248325000

In addition,|260364009
a cough|272039006
is
frequently absent|70232002|2667000
in children less|410601007|160499008
than 2 months old.|260306008|258706009|70753007

More severe signs|242762006|24484000|72670004
and
symptoms
may
include|55919000
:
blue-tinged skin,|304229000
decreased|1250004|260400001|260371004
thirst,|59299002
convulsions,
persistent vomiting,|332982000
extremes|12565001
of temperature,|105723007|246508008
or
a decreased level|1250004|258395000|1250004|276625007|260400001|258395000|260400001|276625007|260371004|258395000|260371004|276625007
of consciousness.[10][11]|106167005

Bacterial|409822003
and
viral cases|398241000|413769002
of pneumonia usually|205237003
present|52101004|246105001
with similar symptoms.

Some causes|134198009
are
associated|47429007
with classic,|255301002|255333006
but
non-specific, clinical characteristics.|10003008|58147004

Pneumonia|205237003
caused|23981006|134198009
by _Legionella_|7527002
may
occur|272120004
with abdominal pain,|21522001
diarrhea,|398032003
or
confusion,|286933003
[13]
while
pneumonia|205237003
caused|23981006|134198009
by _Streptococcus pneumoniae_|9861002
is
associated|47429007
with rusty colored sputum,|24816000|103366001
[14]
and
pneumonia|205237003
caused|23981006|134198009
by _Klebsiella_|75032006
may
have
bloody sputum often|66857006|70232002
described
as "currant jelly".|227453007|385100002|227453007|227722009

Bloody sputum|66857006
(
known|36692007
as hemoptysis|66857006
may
also
occur|272120004
with tuberculosis,|371569005
Gram-negative pneumonia,|430395005
and
lung abscesses|73452002
as well as
more commonly|242762006
with acute bronchitis.|35301006

_Mycoplasma_ pneumonia|46970008
may
occur|272120004
in association|263534001|272151006
with swelling|423666004|442672001
of the lymph nodes|59441001
in the next,|18769003|255260001
joint pain,|57676002
or
an middle ear infection.|65363002

Viral pneumonia|75570004
presents|52101004|246105001
more commonly|242762006
with wheezing|56018004
than
does
bacterial pneumonia.[12]|53084003

Pneumonia|205237003
is
primarily
due to infections
caused|23981006|134198009
by bacteria|409822003
or
viruses|49872002
and
less commonly|276139006|263796003
by fungi|414561005
and
parasites.|37763007

Although
there
are
more
than 100 strains|48532005|276768000
of infectious agents|36272005
identified|7882003
,
only
a few
are
responsible|394851003
for the majority
of the cases.|398241000|413769002

Mixed infections|4559000
with
both
viruses|49872002
and
bacteria|409822003
may
occur|272120004
in
up to 45%
of infections
in children|410601007|160499008
and
15%
of infections
in adults.|133936004

A causative agent|362944004
may
not
be
isolated|46651001
in approximately half|26175008
of cases|398241000|413769002
despite careful testing.[15]|272393004

The term _pneumonia_|205237003
is
sometimes more broadly
applied|410618006
to any condition|260905004
resulting|42752001
in inflammation|257552002
of the lungs|39607008
(
caused|23981006|134198009
for example
by autoimmune diseases,|85828009
chemical burns|426284001
or
drug reactions|264519003
)
;
however,
this inflammation|257552002
is
more accurately|242762006
referred|439980006
to
as
pneumonitis.|205237003

Infective agents|36272005
were
historically
divided|422033008
into "typical"
and
"atypical"|112231000
based|418836005
on their presumed presentations,|246105001
but
the evidence|18669006
has
not
supported|9096001|243114000
this distinction,
thus
it
is
no longer|255511005
emphasized.[18]

Conditions|260905004
and
risk factors|80943009
that
predispose
to pneumonia|205237003
include|55919000
:
smoking,|365981007
immunodeficiency,|234532001
alcoholism,|7200002
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease,|413846005
chronic kidney disease,|46177005|236425005
and
liver disease.|235856003

The use|277889008|419385000
of acid-suppressing medications -|34957004|245780008|410942007
such as proton-pump inhibitors|372525000
or
H2 blockers-|372524001
is
associated|47429007
with an increased risk[19]|35105006|30207005|260366006|30207005
of pneumonia.|205237003

Old age also|105436006|32864002
predisposes
pneumonia.[11]|205237003

Bacteria|409822003
are
the most common cause of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP),|72906007|134198009|385093006
with _Streptococcus pneumoniae_|9861002
isolated|46651001
in nearly 50%
of cases.|398241000|413769002

Other commonly isolated bacteria|74964007|46651001|409822003
include|55919000
:
_Haemophilus influenzae_|44470000
in 20%,
_Chlamydophila pneumoniae_|103514009
in 13%,
and
_Mycoplasma pneumoniae_|58720004|46970008
in 3%|260313008
of cases|398241000|413769002
;[20] _Staphylococcus aureus_|3092008|406602003
;
_Moraxella catarrhalis_|24226003
;
_Legionella pneumophila_|80897008
and
Gram-negative bacilli.|87172008

A number|410680006|410681005
of drug-resistant versions|410942007|30714006|22303008
of the above infections|261183002
are
becoming
more common,|242762006|72906007
including|55919000
drug-resistant _Streptococcus pneumoniae_ (DRSP)|409808003
and
methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA).[11]|266096002|115329001

The
spreading|410677005
of organisms|410653004
is
facilitated
when
risk factors|80943009
are
present.|52101004|246105001

Alcoholism|7200002
is
associated|47429007
with _Streptococcus pneumoniae_,|9861002
anaerobic organisms|410653004
and
_Mycobacterium tuberculosis_|113861009
;
smoking|365981007
facilitates
the effects|253861007
of _Streptococcus pneumoniae_,|9861002
_Haemophilus influenzae_,|44470000
_Moraxella catarrhalis_,|24226003
and
_Legionella pneumophila_.|80897008

Exposure|71677004|24932003
to birds|387972009
is
associated|47429007
with _Chlamydia psittaci_|14590003
;
farm animals|224816003|387961004
with _Coxiella burnetti_|12220009
;
aspiration|14910006|278847003|129316008|68052005
of stomach contents|62059006
with anaerobic organisms|410653004
;
and
cystic fibrosis|190905008
with _Pseudomonas aeruginosa_|52499004
and
_Staphylococcus aureus_.[15]_Streptococcus pneumoniae_|3092008|9861002|406602003|9861002
is
more common|242762006|72906007
in the winter,
[15]
and
should
be
suspected|415684004
in persons|125676002
who
aspirate|119295008
a large amount anaerobic organisms.[11]|255509001|107651007|410653004

In adults,|133936004
viruses|49872002
account
for approximately|26175008
a third[6]|70905002
and
in children|410601007|160499008
for about 15%
of pneumonia cases.|205237003|398241000|205237003|413769002

Commonly implicated agents|260872001
include|55919000
:
rhinoviruses,|90389005
coronaviruses,|243608008
influenza virus,|55014007
respiratory syncytial virus (RSV),
adenovirus,|424470006|25225006
and
parainfluenza.|12188008

Herpes simplex virus rarely|314797000|103356009
causes|134198009
pneumonia,|205237003
except
in groups|261586004|160481000
such as
:
newborns,|133933007
persons|125676002
with cancer,|363346000|372087000
transplant recipients,|263903005|24486003
and
people|125676002
who
have
significant burns.|386134007|125666000

People|125676002
following|255260001
organ transplantation|410653004|263903005
or
those who
are
otherwise
immunocompromised|370391006
present high rates|52101004|75540009|52101004|371879000|246105001|75540009|246105001|371879000
of cytomegalovirus pneumonia.|7678002

Those with viral infections|20401003|34014006|421463005|34014006
may
be
secondarily
infected
with the bacteria _Streptococcus pneumoniae_,|409822003|9861002
_Staphylococcus aureus_,|3092008|406602003
or
_Haemophilus influenzae_,|44470000
particularly
when
other health problems|74964007|263775005|55607006
are
present.|52101004|246105001

Different viruses|263735002|49872002
predominate|83296008
at different periods|263735002|259037005
of the year,|258707000|259039008
for example
during influenza season influenza|6142004|21864008|396425006|21864008
may
account
for over half|21481007
of all viral cases.|398241000|413769002

Outbreaks|443684005
of other viruses also occasionally|74964007|49872002
occur|272120004
,
including|55919000
_hantaviruses_|49445003
and
_coronavirus_.[22]|243608008

Fungal pneumonia|233613009
is
uncommon,|103356009
but
occur|272120004
more commonly|242762006
in individuals|125676002|385435006
with weakened immune systems|116003000
due to AIDS,|62479008
immunosuppressive drugs,|372823004|410942007
or
other medical problems.|74964007|74188005|55607006

It
is
is
most often|4757001|70232002
caused|23981006|134198009
by _Histoplasma capsulatum_,|62969002|56596006
blastomyces,|65205008
_Cryptococcus neoformans_,|42386007|67168003
_Pneumocystis jiroveci_,|79909001
and
_Coccidioides immitis_.|23439005

Histoplasmosis|12962009
is
most common|4757001|72906007
in the Mississippi River basin,|224069001|420531007|91535004
and
coccidioidomycosis|442543009
is
most common|4757001|72906007
in the Southwestern United States.|223688001

The number|410680006|410681005
of cases|398241000|413769002
have
been
increasing|260369004
in the later half|260383002
of the 20th century
due to increasing travel|260369004|420008001
and
rates
of immunosuppression|86553008|38013005
in the population.[25]|385436007|389109008

A variety
of parasites|37763007
can
affect|4065008
the lungs,|39607008
including|55919000
:
_Toxoplasma gondii_,|4649006
_Strongyloides stercoralis_,|42625000
_Ascaris lumbricoides_,|19061001
and
_Plasmodium malariae_.|56395006

These organisms typically|410653004
enter|417985001
the body|279495008|123037004
through direct contact|255589003|11723008|255589003|70862002
with the skin,|119325001|39937001|181469002
ingestion,|111984006
or
via an insect vector.|106763003|260529001

Except for _Paragonimus westermani_,|58412002
most parasites|37763007
do
not specifically
affect|4065008
the lungs|39607008
but
involve|248448006
the lungs secondarily|39607008
to other sites.|74964007|10546003

Some parasites,|37763007
particularly
those belonging
to the _Ascaris_|66953006
and
_Strongyloides_ genera,|10823008|18511007
stimulate
a strong eosinophilic reaction,|260404005|263851003|260404005|14793004|263851003|260404005|365601007|263851003|260404005|191357009|263851003|260404005|419455006|263851003|260404005|419769007|263851003

may
result|394617004
in eosinophilic pneumonia.|367542003

In other infections,|74964007
such as malaria,|248437004
lung involvement|39607008|248448006|181216001|248448006
is
primarily
due to cytokine-induced systemic inflammation.|75777003|16404004|31099001|257552002

In the developed world
these infections
are
most common|4757001|72906007
in people|125676002
returning|7528007
from travel|420008001
or
in immigrants.|161158003

Globally
these infections
are
most common|4757001|72906007
in those
who
are
immunodeficient.[27]|234532001

Idiopathic interstitial pneumonia|196125002
or
noninfectious pneumonia[28]|205237003
are
a class|258391009
of diffuse lung diseases.|19648000|19829001

They
include|55919000
:
diffuse alveolar damage,|19648000|37782003
organizing pneumonia,|68409003
nonspecific interstitial pneumonia,|129452008
lymphocytic interstitial pneumonia,|44274007
desquamative interstitial pneumonia,|8549006
respiratory bronchiolitis interstitial lung disease,|8549006
and
usual interstitial pneumonia.[29]|196125002|28168000

Pneumonia frequently|205237003|70232002
starts|255395001|385652002
as an upper respiratory tract infection|54150009
that
moves|302000008
into the lower respiratory tract.[30]|82094008|281488008

Viruses|49872002
may
reach|282679008
the lung|39607008|181216001
by a number|410680006|410681005
of different routes.|263735002

Respiratory syncytial virus
is
typically
contracted|78558002
when
people touch contaminated objects|125676002|386476006|62604006|260787004|125676002|52962008|62604006|260787004|125676002|397624008|62604006|260787004
and
than they
touch|386476006|52962008|397624008
their eyes|81745001
or
nose.|260540009|181195007

Other viral infections|34014006
occur|272120004
when
contaminated airborne droplets|62604006
are
inhaled|14910006
through the mouth|74262004|123851003|21082005|181220002
or
nose.|260540009|181195007

Once
in the upper airway|261183002|43725001|261183002|89187006
the viruses|49872002
may
make
their way
in the lungs,|39607008
where
they
invade
the cells|4421005
lining|50009006
the airways,|43725001|89187006
alveoli,
or
lung parenchyma.|113255004|201712001

Some viruses|49872002
such as measles|14189004
and
herpes simplex|88594005
may
reach|282679008
the lungs|39607008
via the blood.|87612001|119273009

The invasion|370052007
of the lungs|39607008
may
lead|88488004
to varying degrees|246173007
of cell death.|4421005|419620001|4421005|268923008|362837007|419620001|362837007|268923008

When
the immune system|116003000
responds
to the infection,
even more lung damage|39607008|37782003|181216001|37782003
may
occur.|272120004

White blood cells,|767002|52501007
mainly mononuclear cells,|4421005
primarily
generate
the inflammation.|257552002

As well as
damaging|37782003
the lungs,|39607008
many viruses simultaneously|49872002|79970003
affect|4065008
other organs|74964007|410653004
and
thus
disrupt
other body functions.|74964007|279495008|246464006|74964007|123037004|246464006

Viruses also|49872002
make
the body|279495008|123037004
more susceptible|242762006|131196009
to bacterial infections|301811001
;
in this way bacterial pneumonia|53084003
can
arise|68727004
as a co-morbid condition.[23]|398192003|264657009

Most bacteria|409822003
enter|417985001
the lungs|39607008
via small aspirations|255507004|14910006|255507004|278847003|255507004|129316008|255507004|68052005
of organisms|410653004
residing
in the throat|54066008|49928004|264231000
or
nose.|260540009|181195007

Half
of normal people|17621005|125676002|258744000|125676002
have
these small aspirations|255507004|14910006|255507004|278847003|255507004|129316008|255507004|68052005
during sleep.|258158006

While
the throat always|54066008|49928004|264231000
contains|42504009
bacteria,|409822003
potentially infectious ones|421379005
reside
there only
at certain times|17162000|410669006|17162000|417929005
and
under certain conditions.|17162000|260905004

A minority|410599005|255606000
of types|261664005
of bacteria|409822003
such as _Mycobacterium tuberculosis_|113861009
and
_Legionella pneumophila_|80897008
reach|282679008
the lungs|39607008
via contaminated airborne droplets.|62604006

Bacteria|409822003
can
spread|410677005
also
via the blood.|87612001|119273009

Once
in the lungs,|39607008
bacteria|409822003
may
invade
the spaces
between cells|4421005
and
between alveoli,
where
the macrophages|58986001
and
neutrophils|116712007
(defensive white blood cells|767002|52501007
attempt
to
inactivate
the bacteria.|409822003

The neutrophils also|116712007
release|58000006|68776005|258760001|129299003|115956009
cytokines,|75777003
causing|23981006
a general activation|60132005
of the immune system.|116003000

This
leads|88488004|236874000
to the fever,|386661006
chills,|43724002
and
fatigue|84229001
common|72906007
in bacterial pneumonia.|53084003

The neutrophils,|116712007
bacteria,|409822003
and
fluid|32457005|33463005|255765007
from surrounding blood vessels|355648006|59820001
fill
the alveoli
resulting|42752001
in the consolidation|9656002
seen
on chest X-ray.[34]|399208008

Pneumonia|205237003
is
typically
diagnosed|439401001
based|418836005
on a combination|89780004
of physical signs|72670004
and
a chest X-ray.|399208008

However,
the underlying cause|134198009
can
be
difficult to|52925006
confirm|59156000
,
as
there
is
no definitive test able to|261002007|269814003|371150009|261002007|371150009|261002007|272393004|371150009
distinguish
between bacterial|409822003
and
non-bacterial origin.|409822003|255395001

The World Health Organization|263775005|21139007
has
defined pneumonia|205237003
in children clinically|410601007|160499008
based|418836005
on
either
a cough|272039006
or
difficulty breathing|267036007
and
a rapid respiratory rate,|255358001|86290005
chest indrawing,|261179002
or
a decreased level|1250004|258395000|1250004|276625007|260400001|258395000|260400001|276625007|260371004|258395000|260371004|276625007
of consciousness.|106167005

A rapid respiratory rate|255358001|86290005
is
defined
as greater|263768009
than 60 breaths|11891009
per minute|258701004|255507004|286549009|356624006
in children|410601007|160499008
under 2 months old,|260306008|258706009|70753007
50 breaths|11891009
per minute|258701004|255507004|286549009|356624006
in children 2 months|410601007|258706009|160499008|258706009
to 1 year old,|260305007|258707000|70753007|260305007|259039008|70753007
or
greater|263768009
than 40 breaths|259031006|11891009
per minute|258701004|255507004|286549009|356624006
in children 1|410601007|160499008
to 5 years old.|264706000|258707000|70753007|264605009|258707000|70753007

In children,|410601007|160499008
increased|35105006|260366006
respiratory rate|86290005
and
lower chest indrawing|264074005
are
more sensitive|242762006|83185005
than hearing chest crackles|47078008|261179002|48409008|118230007|261179002|48409008
with a stethoscope.[10]|53639001

In adults,|133936004
investigations|386053000
are
generally
not
needed|410525008|103325001
in mild cases[37]|255604002|398241000|255604002|413769002
:
there
is
a very low risk|260362008|30207005
of pneumonia|205237003
if
all vital signs|61746007|46680005
and
auscultation|37931006
are
normal.|17621005|258744000

In persons|125676002
requiring
hospitalization,|394656005
pulse oximetry,|252465000
chest radiography|399208008
and
blood tests?|252275004
including|55919000
a complete blood count,|26604007
serum electrolytes,|20109005|365765009
C-reactive protein level|55235003
and
possibly liver function tests?|60022001|26958001
are
recommended.

The diagnosis|439401001
of influenza-like illness|95891005
can
be
made
based|418836005
on the signs|72670004
and
symptoms
;
however,
confirmation|74996004
of an influenza infection|6142004|396425006
requires
testing.|272393004

Thus,
treatment|276239002|416118004
is
frequently|70232002
based|418836005
on the presence|386397008
of influenza|6142004|396425006
in the community|133928008
or
a rapid influenza test.[39]|255358001|6142004|269814003|255358001|6142004|255358001|6142004|272393004|255358001|396425006|269814003|255358001|396425006|255358001|396425006|272393004

Physical examination|5880005
may
sometimes
reveal|263857004
low blood pressure,|45007003
high heart rate|75540009|364075005|371879000|364075005
or
low oxygen saturation.|62482003|24099007|103401005|371880002|24099007|103401005

The respiratory rate|86290005
may
be
faster|16985007|277748003
than normal|17621005|258744000
and
this
may
occur|272120004
a day|258703001|259032004
or
two|420797005
before other signs.|74964007|72670004

Examination|5880005
of the chest|261179002
may
be
normal,|17621005|258744000
but
may
show
decreased chest expansion|45508002
on the affected side.|247591002|182353008|248448006|182353008

Harsh breath sounds|47653008
from the larger airways|255509001|43725001|255509001|89187006|263768009|43725001|263768009|89187006
that
are
transmitted|60117003|258150004
through the inflamed lung|39607008|181216001
are
termed
bronchial breathing,|79451004
and
are
heard|47078008|118230007
on auscultation|37931006
with a stethoscope.|53639001

Crackles|48409008
(rales|48409008
)
may
be
heard|47078008|118230007
over the affected area|247591002|42798000|248448006|42798000
during inspiration.|14910006

Percussion|75180006
may
be
dulled|263744001|410708008
over the affected lung,|247591002|39607008|247591002|181216001|248448006|39607008|248448006|181216001
and
increased,|35105006|260366006
rather than
decreased, vocal resonance|248617006
distinguishes
pneumonia|205237003
from a pleural effusion.[9]|60046008

A chest radiograph|399208008
is
frequently|70232002
used|394850002
in diagnosis.|439401001

In people|125676002
with mild disease,|255604002|64572001
imaging|363679005|278395004
is
needed only|410525008|103325001
in those with potential complications,|20401003|30207005|116223007|421463005|30207005|116223007
those
who
have
not
improved|385425000|3442003
with treatment,|276239002|416118004
or
those
in which
the cause|134198009
in uncertain.|64957009

If
a person|125676002
is
sufficiently sick to
require
hospitalization,|394656005
a chest radiograph|399208008
is
recommended.

Findings|404684003
do
not always
correlate
with the severity|272141005
of a disease|64572001
and
do
not reliably
distinguish
between bacterial infection|301811001

viral infection.[10]|34014006

X-ray presentations|246105001|52250000|246105001|168537006|246105001|363680008|246105001
of pneumonia|205237003
may
be
classified|73504009
as lobar pneumonia,|278516003|233607000
bronchopneumonia|396285007
(also
known|36692007
as lobular pneumonia|396284006

interstitial pneumonia.|64667001

Bacterial, community-acquired pneumonia,|53084003|277057000
classically
show
lung consolidation|95436008
of one lung segmental lobe|421379005|31094006|62372003

vary
,
and
other patterns|74964007|272135003
are
common|72906007
in other types|74964007|261664005
of pneumonia.|205237003

Aspiration pneumonia|422588002
may
present|52101004|246105001
with bilateral opacities primarily|51440002|125149003|51440002|128305008
in the bases|418836005
of the lungs|39607008

In patients|116154003
managed|119270007
in the community,|133928008
determining
the causative agent|362944004
is
not cost effective|255403003|254648000
and
typically

alter
management.|413454004|119270007

For people|125676002
who
do
not
respond
to treatment,|276239002|416118004
sputum culture|104173009

if zanamivir|387010007
or
oseltamivir|412261005

The use|277889008|419385000
of antibiotics|255631004
in viral pneumonia|75570004
is
recommended
by some experts
as
it
is
impossible to
rule|10828004
out
a complicating bacterial infection.|255302009|301811001

The British Thoracic Society
recommends
that antibiotics|255631004
be
withheld
in those with mild disease.|20401003|255604002|64572001|421463005|255604002|64572001

The use|277889008|419385000
of corticosteroids|79440004
is
controversial.[6]

In general, aspiration pneumonitis|60132005|422588002|60132005|155597006
is
treated conservatively|28995006
with antibiotics|255631004
indicated|410535002
only
for aspiration pneumonia.|422588002

The choice
of antibiotic|255631004
will
depend
on several factors,|261028005
including|55919000
the suspected causative organism|410653004|415684004|410653004
and
whether pneumonia|205237003
was
acquired|255396000
in the community|133928008
or
developed
in a hospital setting.|285201006

Common options|72906007
include|55919000
clindamycin,|372786004
a combination|89780004
of a beta-lactam antibiotic|409132008
and
metronidazole,|372602008
or
an aminoglycoside.|324116004|14443002

Corticosteroids|79440004
are
sometimes
used|394850002
in aspiration pneumonia,|422588002
but
there
is
limited evidence to|255469002|18669006
support|9096001|243114000
their effectiveness.[69]|255403003|264698002

With treatment,|276239002|416118004
most types|261664005
of bacterial pneumonia|53084003
will
stabilize|409051000
in 3?6 days.|260281002|258703001

It often|70232002
takes|419652001
a few weeks|57176003|258705008
before most symptoms
resolve.

X-ray|52250000|168537006|363680008

typically
clear|263707001
within four weeks|421534005|258705008
and
mortality|409651001
is
low|62482003|371880002
(less
than 1%|260305007
).

In the elderly|105436006
or
people|125676002
who

than 12 week.|258705008|259038000

In persons|125676002
who
require

may
be
as
high|75540009|371879000

Pneumonia|205237003
is
the most common hospital-acquired infection|4757001|72906007|19168005
that results|394617004
in death.|419620001|268923008

Before the advent
of antibiotics,|255631004
mortality|409651001
was
typically 30%
in those
who where
hospitalized.[15]|184091000

Complications|116223007
may
occur|272120004
particularly
in the elderly|105436006
and
those
with underlying health problems.|263775005|55607006

This
may
include|55919000
,
among others|74964007
:
empyema,|312682007
lung abscess,|73452002
bronchiolitis obliterans,|40100001
acute respiratory distress syndrome,|67782005

Clinical prediction rules|58147004|10828004
have
been
developed
to
prognosticate
more objectively outcomes|242762006|394617004
in pneumonia.|205237003

These rules|10828004
are
often|70232002
used|394850002
in deciding
whether
or
not to
hospitalize|184091000
the person.[18]|125676002

In pneumonia,|205237003
a collection
of fluid|32457005|33463005|255765007
may
form|246176004
in the space
that
surrounds|355648006
the lung.|39607008|181216001

Occasionally,
microorganisms|264395009
will
infect
this fluid,|32457005|33463005|255765007
causing|23981006
an empyema.|312682007

To
distinguish
an empyema|312682007
from the more common simple parapneumonic effusion,|242762006|72906007|13673007|81075000
the fluid|32457005|33463005|255765007
may
be
collected
with a needle|79068005
(thoracentesis,|91602002
and
examined.|64049009

If
this
shows
evidence|18669006
of empyema,|312682007
complete drainage|255594003|307488001|255594003|122462000
of the fluid|32457005|33463005|255765007
is
necessary, often|70232002
requiring
a drainage cathater.|307488001|122462000

In severe cases|24484000|398241000|24484000|413769002
of empyema,|312682007
surgery|83578000
may
be
needed.|410525008|103325001

If
the infected fluid|32457005|33463005|255765007
is
not
drained|32712000
,
the infection
may
persist
,
because
antibiotics|255631004
do
not
penetrate|53568006
well|20572008
into the pleural cavity.|91381003

If
the fluid|32457005|33463005|255765007
is
sterile,|261029002|15296000
it
needs|410525008|103325001
to
be
drained|32712000
only
if
it
is
causing symptoms|23981006
or
remains
unresolved.[74]|263921008

Rarely,|103356009
bacteria|409822003
in the lung|39607008|181216001
will
form|246176004
a pocket
of infected fluid|32457005|33463005|255765007
called
a lung abscess.|73452002

Lung abscesses|73452002
can
usually
be
seen
with a chest X-ray|399208008
but
frequently|70232002
require
a chest CT scan to|169069000
confirm|59156000
the diagnosis.|439401001

Abscesses typically|128477000
occur|272120004
in aspiration pneumonia,|422588002
and
often|70232002
contain|42504009
several types|261028005|261664005
of bacteria.|409822003

Long term antibiotics|255631004
are
usually adequate to|51117008|88323005
treat|395077000
a lung abscess,|73452002
but
sometimes
the abscess|128477000
must
be
drained|32712000
by a surgeon|304292004
or
radiologist.[74]|66862007

Pneumonia|205237003
can
cause|23981006|134198009
respiratory failure|409622000
by triggering acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS),|67782005|410658008|67782005
which
results|394617004
from a combination|89780004
of infection
and
inflammatory response.

The lungs quickly fill|39607008
with fluid|32457005|33463005|255765007
and
become
stiff.

This stiffness,|271587009
combined|89780004
with severe difficulties|24484000|371157007
extracting|62972009
oxygen|24099007
due to the alveolar fluid,|32457005|33463005|255765007
may
require
long periods|255511005|259037005
of mechanical ventilation
for survival.[22]

Sepsis|105592009|91302008
is
a potential complication|30207005|116223007|30207005|263718001
of pneumonia|205237003
but
occurs|272120004
typically only
in people|125676002
with poor immunity|11403006|58915005|255351007|58915005
or
hyposplenism.|23761004

The organisms most commonly|410653004
involved|248448006
are
_Streptococcus pneumoniae_,|9861002
_Haemophilus influenzae_|44470000
and
_Klebsiella pneumoniae_.|56415008

Other causes|74964007|134198009
of the symptoms
should
be
considered
such as a myocardial infarction|22298006
or
a pulmonary embolism.[75]|59282003

Pneumonia|205237003
is
a common illness|72906007|39104002
affecting|247591002|248448006
approximately 450 million people|26175008|125676002

pneumonia|205237003
is
the 8th leading cause|236874000|134198009

(151 million
in the developing world
and
5 million|264706000|264605009
in the developed world

It
resulted|42752001|394617004
in 1.6 million deaths,|260305007|419620001|260305007|268923008
or
28?34%
of all deaths|419620001|268923008

Countries|223369002
with the greatest burden|4757001
of disease|64572001
include|55919000
:

This clinical description|58147004
is
quite similar
to those
found|404684003
in modern textbooks,
and
it
reflected|225436004
the extent|255590007
of medical knowledge|74188005|225795001
through the Middle Ages|28288005
into the 19th century.

Edwin Klebs
was
the first|255216001|232714002
who
observed
bacteria|409822003
in the airways|43725001|89187006
of persons|125676002
who
died|419620001|419099009
of pneumonia|205237003
in 1875.

Initial work|884001|261041009|232714002|261041009
identifying|7882003
the two common bacterial causes _Streptococcus pneumoniae_|420797005|72906007|53084003|134198009|58800005
and
_Klebsiella pneumoniae_|56415008
was
performed|398166005
by Carl Friedl?nder[84]
and
Albert Fr?nkel[85]
in 1882
and
1884,
respectively.

Friedl?nder's initial work|884001|261041009|232714002|261041009
introduced|127487003
the Gram stain,|385484003|62777006
a fundamental laboratory test still used today to|269814003|394850002
identify|7882003
and
categorize bacteria.|409822003

Christian Gram's paper|276116000|258682000|50833004|160549006|258682000|50833004
describing
the procedure|71388002
in 1884
helped
to
differentiate|263933003
the two bacteria,|420797005|409822003
and
showed
that pneumonia|205237003
could
be
caused|23981006|134198009
by more|242762006
than one microorganism.[86]|421379005|264395009

Sir William Osler,
known|36692007
as "
the father|66839005
of modern medicine,|410942007
"
appreciated
the death|419620001|268923008
and
disability|21134002
caused|23981006|134198009
by pneumonia,|205237003
describing
it
as
the "
captain
of the men|339947000
of death"|419620001|268923008
in 1918,
as
it
had
overtaken tuberculosis|371569005
as one|421379005
of the leading causes|236874000|134198009
of death|419620001|268923008
in this time.|410669006

This phrase
was
originally
coined
by John Bunyan
in reference
to "consumption"
(tuberculosis|371569005
).

Osler also described pneumonia|205237003
as "
the old man's friend"|70753007|248153007|113163005|70753007|339947000|113163005|70753007|278412004|113163005
as
death|419620001|268923008
was
often quick|70232002|255358001
and
painless|255350008
when
there
were
many slower more painful ways to|419443000|22253000
die.[15]|419620001|399069006|419099009

Several developments|261028005|278923009
in the 1900s
improved|385425000|3442003
the outcome|394617004
for those with pneumonia.|20401003|205237003|421463005|205237003

With the advent
of penicillin|373270004
and
other antibiotics,|74964007|255631004
modern surgical techniques,|83578000|272394005
and
intensive care
in the 20th century,
mortality|409651001
from pneumonia,|205237003
had
approached|103379005
30%,
dropped|426684005|404218003
precipitously
in the developed world.

Vaccination
of infants|418119000
against _Haemophilus influenzae_ type B|103442008
began|255395001
in 1988
and
led|88488004|236874000
to a dramatic decline
in cases shortly thereafter.|398241000|413769002

Vaccination
against _Streptococcus pneumoniae_|9861002
in adults|133936004
began|255395001
in 1977,
and
in children|410601007|160499008
in 2000,
resulting|42752001
in a similar decline.[90]|264705001|264703008

Due to the high burden|75540009|371879000
of disease|64572001
in developing countries|223369002
and
a relatively low awareness|62482003|312012004|371880002|312012004
of the disease|64572001
in developed countries,|223369002
the global health community|60132005|263775005|133928008
has
declared
12th November
the World Pneumonia Day,|205237003|258703001|205237003|259032004
a day|258703001|259032004
for concerned citizens
and
policy makers to|308285002
take|419652001
action|129264002
against the disease.|64572001

The global economic cost|60132005
of community acquired pneumonia|385093006
has
been
estimated|414135002
at $17 billion.[11]
