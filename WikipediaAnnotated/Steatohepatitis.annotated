*Steatohepatitis|442191002
*
*
(also
known|36692007
as
*
*fatty liver disease|235856003|64572001
*
*
)
is
a type|261664005
of liver disease,|235856003
characterized
by inflammation|257552002
of the liver|10200004|181268008
with concurrent fat accumulation|68405009|271590003
in liver|10200004|181268008
("steato",
meaning|255586005
fat,|271590003
"hepatitis",|128241005|40468003|396423004
meaning|255586005
inflammation|257552002
of the liver|10200004|181268008
).

Mere deposition|46595003
of fat|271590003
in the liver|10200004|181268008
is
termed steatosis,|29185008
and
together
these
constitute
fatty liver changes.|243326001|263703002

Classically
seen
in alcoholics|228281002
as part|260726005
of alcoholic liver disease,
steatohepatitis also|442191002
is
frequently|70232002
found|404684003
in people|125676002
with diabetes|73211009
and
obesity|414915002
and
it
is
related|272151006|262094002
to metabolic syndrome.|237602007

When
not
associated|47429007
with excessive alcohol intake,|260378005|160573003
it
is
referred|439980006
to
as
*
*nonalcoholic steatohepatitis|197315008
*
*,
or
*
*NASH
*
*
and
is
the progressive form|255314001|246176004
of the relatively benign non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.|30807003|197315008

Steatohepatitis|442191002
of
either
etiology|134198009
may
progress|385651009
to cirrhosis,|19943007
and
NASH
is
now
believed
to
be
a frequent cause|70232002|134198009
of unexplained cirrhosis|19943007
(
at least
in Western societies
).

NASH
is
also
associated|47429007
with lysosomal acid lipase deficiency.|238074007

Steatohepatitis|442191002
is
characterized microscopically
by hepatic fat accumulation|32381004|271590003
(steatosis|29185008
)
,
mixed|26242008
lobular inflammation,|40266001|257552002
ballooning
degeneration|33359002
of hepatocytes|30396005
(sometimes
with identifiable Mallory bodies,|7882003|20894005
glycogenated hepatocyte nuclei,|30396005|84640000
and
pericellular fibrosis.|263756000

The "chicken wire" pattern|409910000|63112008|272135003|226955001|63112008|272135003
of the pericellular fibrosis,|263756000
which
affects|4065008
portal areas only secondarily|32381004|42798000
in later stages,|260383002|261612004
is
very characteristic|260358002
and
is
identified|7882003
on trichrome stains.|104207001

Recent studies|6493001|110465008|6493001|224699009
suggest
diet,|41829006
exercise,|61686008
and
antiglycemic drugs|410942007
may
alter
the course|288524001
of the disease.|64572001

A randomized controlled trial|31509003|110465008
found|404684003
,
"pioglitazone|395828009
led|88488004|236874000
to metabolic
and
histologic improvement|67151002
in subjects
with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis".[2]|197315008

As of 2007,
no treatment|276239002|416118004
has
yet
emerged
as the "gold standard".|2309006|371256005

General recommendations|60132005
include|55919000
improving|385633008
metabolic risk factors|80943009
and
reducing alcohol intake.|260400001|160573003

However,
vitamin E|37237003
can
improve|385425000|3442003|385633008
some symptoms
of NASH
and
was
superior|261183002
to insulin sensitizer|412222002
in one large study.|421379005|255509001|110465008|421379005|255509001|224699009

In the Pioglitazone|395828009
versus
Vitamin E|37237003
versus
Placebo
for the Treatment|276239002|416118004
of Nondiabetic Patients with Nonalcoholic Steatohepatitis (PIVENS) trial,|18720000|116154003|197315008|110465008
for patients|116154003
with NASH
but
without diabetes mellitus,|73211009
the use|277889008|419385000
of very high dosages|260360000|277406006
of vitamin E|37237003
(800 IU/day|259008006
)
for four years|421534005|258707000
was
associated|47429007
with a significantly higher rate|75540009|371879000
of improvement
than placebo
(43%
vs.

19%
)
in the primary outcome.|63161005|394617004|261424001|394617004

The primary outcome|63161005|394617004|261424001|394617004
was
an improvement
in certain histological features|17162000|67151002
as
measured|258104002
by biopsy,|86273004
but
it
did
not
improve|385425000|3442003|385633008
fibrosis.|263756000

Pioglitazone,|395828009
an insulin sensitizer,|412222002
improved|385425000|3442003
some features
of NASH,
but
not
the primary outcome,|63161005|394617004|261424001|394617004
and
resulted|42752001|394617004
in a significant weight gain|386134007|262286000
(mean 4.7 kilograms|255586005|258683005
)
which
persisted
after pioglitazone|395828009
was
discontinued.[4]|410546004

A retrospective cohort study|110465008|224699009
concluded
,
"liver failure|59927004
is
the main cause|63161005|134198009
of morbidity
and
mortality|409651001
in NASH-associated cirrhosis.|47429007|19943007

The prognosis|20481000
is
either similar
or
less severe|276139006|24484000|263796003|24484000
than HCV-cirrhosis."[5]|62944002|19943007

NASH
was
first|255216001|232714002
described
in 1980
in a series|13039001
of patients|116154003
of the Mayo Clinic.|223807006|35971002|223807006|257585005

Its relevance
and
high prevalence|75540009|371879000
were
recognized
mainly
in the 1990s.

Some
think|88952004
NASH
is
a diagnosis|439401001
of exclusion,
and
many cases|260396001|398241000|260396001|413769002
may
be
in fact
be
due to other causes.[7]|74964007|134198009
