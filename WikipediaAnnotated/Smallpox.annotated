*Smallpox|67924001|243568000
*
*
was
an infectious disease|191415002
unique
to humans,|278412004
caused|23981006|134198009
by either
of two virus variants,|420797005|49872002|40885006|420797005|40885006
_Variola major_|67924001|47452006
and
_Variola minor_.|72294005

The disease|64572001
is
also
known|36692007
by the Latin names _
*
*Variola|67924001
*
*_
or
_
*
*Variola vera|67924001
*
*_,
which
is
a derivative
of the Latin _varius_,
meaning|255586005
"
spotted|271807003|64996003|9126005|23840004|285305004
",
or
_varus_,|261040005
meaning|255586005
"pimple".|271760008|103605005

The term "smallpox"|67924001|243568000
was
first|255216001|232714002
used|394850002
in Britain
in the 15th century to
distinguish
variola|67924001
from the "great pox"|76272004
(syphilis.|76272004

The
last naturally
occurring|272120004
case|398241000
of smallpox|67924001|243568000
(_Variola minor_|72294005
)
was
diagnosed|439401001
on 26 October 1977.[3]

Smallpox localizes|67924001|255471002|243568000|255471002
in small blood vessels|27915009
of the skin|119325001|39937001|181469002
and
in the mouth|74262004|123851003|21082005|181220002
and
throat.|54066008|49928004|264231000

In the skin|119325001|39937001|181469002
it
results|394617004
in a characteristic maculopapular rash|247471006
and
,
later,
raised fluid-filled blisters.|260399008|32457005|408764000|260399008|32457005|247464001|260399008|33463005|408764000|260399008|33463005|247464001|260399008|255765007|408764000|260399008|255765007|247464001|260399008|408764000|260399008|247464001

_V.

major_|255603008
produces
a more serious disease|242762006|42745003|64572001
and
has
an overall mortality rate|409651001
of 30?35%.

_V.

minor_|410599005|255606000
causes|134198009
a milder form|255604002|246176004
of disease|64572001
(also
known|36692007
as
*
*alastrim|72294005
*
*,
*
*cottonpox
*
*,
*
*milkpox
*
*,
*
*whitepox
*
*,
and
*
*Cuban itch|424492005
*

)
which
kills|248007002
about 1%|260305007
of its victims.

Long-term complications|116223007
of _V.

major_ infection|255603008
include|55919000
characteristic scars,|70582006|275322007
commonly
on the face,|89545001|302549007
which
occur|272120004
in 65?85%|264695004
of survivors.

Blindness
resulting|42752001
from corneal ulceration|91514001
and
scarring,|275322007
and
limb deformities|445144002
due to arthritis|3723001
and
osteomyelitis|60168000
are
less common complications,|276139006|72906007|116223007|263796003|72906007|116223007
seen
in about 2?5%
of cases.|398241000|413769002

Smallpox|67924001|243568000
is
believed to
have
emerged
in human populations|278412004|385436007
about 10,000 BC.

The earliest physical evidence|264499004|5880005|18669006|264499004|19388002|18669006
of it
is
probably
the pustular rash|48055004
on the mummified body|371648002
of Pharaoh Ramses V
of Egypt.|223511009

The disease|64572001
killed|248007002
an estimated 400,000 Europeans annually|414135002|414152003|53281000|414135002|53281000
during the closing years|29179001|258707000
of the 18th century
(
including|55919000
five reigning monarchs,|421820001
[8]
and
was
responsible|394851003
for a third|70905002
of all blindness.

Of all
those infected, 20?60%?
and
over 80%|21481007
of infected children?|410601007|160499008
died|419620001|419099009
from the disease.|64572001

Smallpox|67924001|243568000
was
responsible|394851003
for an estimated 300?500 million deaths|414135002|419620001|414135002|268923008
during the 20th century.

As
recently|6493001
as 1967,
the World Health Organization (WHO)|263775005|21139007
estimated|414135002
that 15 million people|125676002
contracted|78558002
the disease|64572001
and
that two million|420797005
died|419620001|419099009
in
that year.[3]|258707000|259039008

After vaccination campaigns
throughout the 19th
and
20th centuries,
the
WHO
certified
the eradication
of smallpox|67924001|243568000
in 1979.

Smallpox|67924001|243568000
is
one|421379005
of two infectious diseases to|420797005|191415002
have
been
eradicated
,
the other|74964007
being
rinderpest,|40440002
which
was
declared
eradicated
in 2011.[14][15][16]

There
were
two clinical forms|420797005|58147004|246176004
of smallpox.|67924001|243568000

Variola major|67924001|47452006
was
the severe|24484000
and
most common form,|72906007|246176004
with a more extensive rash|242762006|41118005|271807003
and
higher fever.|75540009|386661006|371879000|386661006

Variola minor|72294005
was
a less common presentation,|276139006|72906007|246105001|263796003|72906007|246105001
and
a much less severe disease,|242762006|24484000|64572001|4757001|24484000|64572001
with historical death rates|409651001|392521001|409651001
of 1%|260305007
or
less.|276139006|263796003

Subclinical|74314007
(asymptomatic infections|28456004
with variola virus|243568000
have
been
noted
but
were
not common.|72906007

In addition,|260364009
a form|246176004
called
_variola sine eruptione_|74724001
(smallpox|67924001|243568000
without rash|271807003
)
was
seen
generally
in vaccinated persons.|125676002

This form|246176004
was
marked|46998006
by a fever|386661006
that
occurred|272120004
after the usual incubation period|406646006
and
could
be
confirmed|59156000
only
by antibody studies|166164009
or
,
rarely,|103356009
by virus isolation.[18]|49872002|40174006|49872002|46651001|40174006|46651001

The incubation period|406646006
between contraction|78558002
and
the first obvious symptoms|255216001|232714002
of the disease|64572001
is
around 12 days.|258703001

Once
inhaled|14910006
,
variola major virus|312410004
invades
the oropharyngeal|31389004
(mouth|74262004|123851003|21082005|181220002
and
throat|54066008|49928004|264231000
)
or
the respiratory mucosa,|258162000|313268005|449071006|313268005
migrates
to regional lymph nodes,|410673009|59441001|255470001|59441001
and
begins|255395001
to multiply.|421206002

In the initial growth phase|884001|21191007|232714002|21191007
the virus|49872002
seems
to
move|302000008|384598002|370125004
from cell|4421005|362837007
to cell,|4421005|362837007
but
around the 12th day,|258703001|259032004
lysis|371757000|239551005
of many infected cells|4421005
occurs|272120004
and
the virus|49872002
is
found|404684003
in the bloodstream
in large numbers|255509001|410680006|255509001|410681005
(
this
is
called _viremia_|2528003
)
,
and
a second wave|81170007|257997001|288495006
of multiplication
occurs|272120004
in the spleen,|78961009|181279003
bone marrow,|279729006
and
lymph nodes.|59441001

The initial|884001|232714002
or
prodromal symptoms
are
similar
to other viral diseases
such as influenza|6142004|396425006
and
the common cold|82272006|54150009
:
fever|386661006
of
at least 38.5 ?C|276139006|264670000|263796003|264670000
(101 ?F|372639009
)
,
muscle pain,|68962001
malaise,|367391008
headache|25064002
and
prostration.|84946008

As the digestive tract|122865005
is
commonly
involved|248448006
,
nausea|422587007
and
vomiting|249497008
and
backache often|22913005|70232002
occur.|272120004

The prodrome,|83931009
or
preeruptive stage,|21191007|371508000|261612004
usually
lasts
2?4 days.|260306008|258703001

By days 12?15|258703001
the first visible lesions?small reddish spots|255216001|255507004|271807003|255216001|255507004|285305004|232714002|255507004|271807003|232714002|255507004|285305004
called
_enanthem_?|5862001
appear
on mucous membranes|313268005
of the mouth,|74262004|123851003|21082005|181220002
tongue,|21974007|181226008
palate,|261145003|181227004
and
throat,|54066008|49928004|264231000
and
temperature|105723007|246508008
falls|1912002
to near normal.|277752003|17621005|277752003|258744000

These lesions
rapidly enlarge|418694008|260376009|418694008|118452000
and
rupture,|415747007
releasing|129299003
large amounts|255509001|107651007
of virus|49872002
into the saliva.[5]|256897009

Smallpox virus preferentially|243568000
attacks|216299002
skin cells,|314819008
causing|23981006
the characteristic pimples|103605005
(called macules|112629002
associated|47429007
with the disease.|64572001

A rash|271807003
develops
on the skin 24|119325001|39937001|181469002
to 48 hours|255249005
after lesions
on the mucous membranes|313268005
appear.

Typically
the macules|112629002
first
appear
on the forehead,|52795006
then rapidly|418694008
spread|410677005
to the whole face,|260232004|89545001|260232004|302549007
proximal portions|40415009|260726005
of extremities,|66019005|2592007
the trunk,|22943007|262225004
and
lastly
to distal portions|46053002|260726005
of extremities.|66019005|2592007

The process|415178003
takes|419652001
no more|242762006
than 24
to 36 hours,|258702006
after
which no new lesions|7147002
appear.

At this point variola major infection|67924001|47452006
can
take|419652001
several very different courses,|261028005|260358002|263735002|288524001
resulting|42752001
in four types|421534005|261664005
of smallpox disease|67924001
based|418836005
on the Rao classification|73504009
:
[19] ordinary,
modified|243326001
,
malignant|21594007
(
or
flat|6041008|257564005
)
,
and
hemorrhagic.|255345002

Historically,
smallpox|67924001|243568000
has
an overall fatality rate|399166001
of about 30%
;
however,
the malignant|21594007
and
hemorrhagic forms|255345002|246176004
are
usually fatal.[20]|399166001

Ninety percent|118582008
or
more
of smallpox cases|67924001|398241000|67924001|413769002|243568000|398241000|243568000|413769002
among unvaccinated persons|125676002
are
of the ordinary type.|261664005

In this form|246176004
of the disease,|64572001
by the second day|81170007|258703001|81170007|259032004|257997001|258703001|257997001|259032004|288495006|258703001|288495006|259032004
of the rash|271807003
the macules|112629002
become
raised|260399008
_papules_.|443871003

By the third|70905002
or
fourth day|29970001|258703001|29970001|259032004
the papules fill|443871003
with an opalescent fluid to|263824001|32457005|263824001|33463005|263824001|255765007|263824001
become
_vesicles_.|82515000

This fluid|32457005|33463005|255765007
becomes
opaque|125149003|134295003
and
turbid|263906002
within 24?48 hours,|123027009|259029002
giving|419582001
them the appearance|386548000|255412001
of pustules|271760008
;
however,
the so-called pustules|223528007|271760008
are
filled
with tissue debris,|85756007|257159000
not pus.[5]|11311000|119323008

By the sixth|53046009
or
seventh day,|86777004|258703001|86777004|259032004
all the skin lesions|95324001
have
become
pustules.|271760008

Between seven|420359007
and
ten days|23067006|258703001|420258001|258703001
the pustules|271760008
mature|34071009
and
reach|282679008
their maximum size.|398303009|277049003

The pustules|271760008
are
sharply
raised|260399008
,
typically round, tense,|42700002|263897001
and
firm|20583004
to the touch.|386476006|52962008|397624008

The pustules|271760008
are
deeply
embedded
in the dermis,|53534000
giving|419582001
them the
feel|285854004
of a small bead|255507004
in the skin.|119325001|39937001|181469002

Fluid slowly|32457005|419443000|33463005|419443000|255765007|419443000|419443000
leaks|87952002
from the pustules,|271760008
and
by the end|261782000|422117008
of the second week|81170007|258705008|81170007|259038000|257997001|258705008|257997001|259038000|288495006|258705008|288495006|259038000
the pustules|271760008
deflate
,
and
start|255395001
to
dry|13880007
up,
forming|35810008
crusts|69640009
(
or
scabs|69640009
).

By day 16?20 scabs|258703001|69640009|259032004|69640009
have
formed|35810008
over all|21481007
the lesions,
which
have
started|385652002
to
flake|387085005
off,
leaving|7771000|90737002
depigmented scars.[21]|70582006|275322007

Ordinary smallpox generally|67924001
produces
a discrete rash,|271807003
in which
the pustules|271760008
stand|282972001
out
on the skin separately.|119325001|39937001|181469002

The distribution|255464007
of the rash|271807003
is
densest|255596001
on the face|89545001|302549007
;
denser|255596001
on the extremities|66019005|2592007
than
on the trunk|22943007|262225004
;
and
on the extremities,|66019005|2592007
denser|255596001
on the distal parts|46053002|260726005
than
on the proximal.|40415009

The palms|107631008
of the hands|85562004
and
soles|57999000
of the feet|56459004|259051005
are
involved|248448006
in the majority
of cases.|398241000|413769002

Sometimes,
the blisters|408764000|247464001
merge
into sheets,|255292000
forming|35810008
a confluent rash,|74832004|271807003
which
begin|255395001
to
detach
the outer layers|261074009
of skin|119325001|39937001|181469002
from the underlying flesh.

Patients|116154003
with confluent smallpox often|74832004|67924001|70232002|74832004|243568000|70232002
remain
ill even|367391008
after scabs|69640009
have
formed|35810008
over all|21481007
the lesions.

In one case series,|421379005|398241000|13039001
the case-fatality rate|409653003
in confluent smallpox|74832004|67924001|74832004|243568000
was
62%.[18]

Referring|439980006
to the character
of the eruption|271807003|1806006
and
the rapidity|255358001
of its development,|278923009
modified smallpox|51423006
occurs|272120004
mostly
in previously vaccinated people.|125676002

In this
form|246176004
the prodromal illness still|39104002
occurs|272120004
but
may
be
less severe|276139006|24484000|263796003|24484000
than
in the ordinary type.|261664005

There
is
usually
no fever|386661006
during evolution
of the rash.|271807003

The skin lesions|95324001
tend
to
be
fewer|57176003
and
evolve|59381007
more quickly,|242762006
are
more superficial,|242762006|26283006
and
may
not
show
the uniform characteristic|27617004
of more typical smallpox.|242762006|67924001|242762006|243568000

Modified smallpox|51423006
is
rarely,|103356009
if
ever,
fatal.|399166001

This form|246176004
of variola major|67924001|47452006
is
more easily|242762006|36203004
confused|286933003
with chickenpox.[18]|38907003

In malignant-type smallpox|86497005|261664005
(also
called
flat smallpox|6041008|67924001|6041008|243568000|257564005|67924001|257564005|243568000
)
the lesions
remain
almost flush|271811009
with the skin|119325001|39937001|181469002
at the time|410669006
when
raised vesicles|260399008|82515000
form|246176004
in the ordinary type.|261664005

It
is
unknown|261665006
why
some people|125676002
develop
this type.|261664005

Historically,
it
accounted
for 5%?10%|264706000|264605009
of cases,|398241000|413769002
and
the majority
(72%
)
were
children.|410601007|160499008

Malignant smallpox|86497005
is
accompanied
by a severe prodromal phase|24484000|288480009
that lasts 3?4 days,|258703001
prolonged|255224006
high fever,|75540009|386661006|371879000|386661006
and
severe symptoms|162470006
of toxemia.|15394000

The rash|271807003
on the tongue|21974007|181226008
and
palate|261145003|181227004
is
extensive.|41118005

Skin lesions mature slowly|95324001|34071009|419443000
and
by the seventh|86777004
or
eighth day|51601003|258703001|51601003|259032004
they
are
flat|6041008|257564005
and
appear
to
be
buried
in the skin.|119325001|39937001|181469002

Unlike ordinary-type smallpox,|67924001|261664005
the vesicles|82515000
contain|42504009
little fluid,|32457005|33463005|255765007
are
soft|37378003
and
velvety
to the touch,|386476006|52962008|397624008
and
may
contain|42504009
hemorrhages.|131148009

Malignant smallpox|86497005
is
nearly always fatal.[18]|399166001

Hemorrhagic smallpox|409641002
is
a severe|24484000
form|246176004
that
is
accompanied
by extensive bleeding|41118005|131148009
into the skin,|119325001|39937001|181469002
mucous membranes,|313268005
and
gastrointestinal tract.|122865005|279972009

This form|246176004
develops
in approximately 2%|26175008
of infections
and
occurred|272120004
mostly
in adults.|133936004

In hemorrhagic smallpox|409641002
the skin|119325001|39937001|181469002
does
not blister,|408764000|247464001|417237009
but
remains
smooth.|82280004

Instead,
bleeding|131148009
occurs|272120004
under the skin,|119325001|39937001|181469002
making
it
look|386548000
charred|28334003
and
black,|315240009|413464008|15086000|371252007
[18] hence
this form|246176004
of the disease|64572001
is
also
known|36692007
as black pox.[23]|315240009|264657009|413464008|264657009|15086000|264657009|371252007|264657009

In the early,|264499004
or
fulminating form,|246176004
hemorrhaging|131148009
appears
on the second|81170007|257997001|288495006
or
third day|70905002|258703001|70905002|259032004
as sub-conjunctival bleeding|261089000|21117005|118555000|21117005
turns|282987006
the whites|413773004|185984009
of the eyes deep red.|81745001|131197000|386713009|81745001|131197000|371240000

Hemorrhagic smallpox also|409641002
produces
a dusky erythema,|48786000|444827008
petechiae,|423716004
and
hemorrhages|131148009
in the spleen,|78961009|181279003
kidney,|64033007|17373004|181414000
serosa,|75858005
muscle,|91727004
and
,
rarely,|103356009
the epicardium,|6871001
liver,|10200004|181268008
testes,|36528006|279572002
ovaries|15497006|83238006
and
bladder.|89837001|302512001

Death often|419620001|70232002|268923008|70232002
occurs|272120004
suddenly
between the fifth|32088001
and
seventh days|86777004|258703001
of illness,|39104002
when
only
a few insignificant skin lesions|57176003|95324001
are
present.|52101004|246105001

A later|260383002
form|246176004
of the disease|64572001
occurs|272120004
in patients|116154003
who
survive
for 8?10 days.|258703001

The hemorrhages|131148009
appear
in the early eruptive period,|264499004|271807003|259037005|264499004|1806006|259037005
and
the rash|271807003
is
flat|6041008|257564005
and
does
not
progress|385651009
beyond the vesicular stage.|63727002|21191007|63727002|371508000|63727002|261612004

Patients|116154003
in the early stage|264499004|21191007|264499004|371508000|264499004|261612004
of disease|64572001
show
a decrease|260400001|260370003
in coagulation factors|350475008
(e.g.|258795003

platelets,|16378004
prothrombin,|7348004
and
globulin|81905004
and
an increase|260366006
in circulating antithrombin.|65929005|34086003|65929005|414010005

Patients|116154003
in the late stage|260383002|21191007|260383002|371508000|260383002|261612004
have
significant thrombocytopenia|386134007|415116008
;
however,
deficiency|260372006|248325000
of coagulation factors|350475008
is
less severe.|276139006|24484000|263796003|24484000

Some
in the late|260383002
stage|21191007|371508000|261612004
also
show
increased antithrombin.|35105006|34086003|35105006|414010005|260366006|34086003|260366006|414010005

This form|246176004
of smallpox|67924001|243568000
occurs|272120004
in anywhere
from 3|260313008
to 25%
of fatal cases|399166001|398241000|399166001|413769002
depending
on the virulence
of the smallpox strain.|67924001|48532005|67924001|276768000|243568000|48532005|243568000|276768000

Hemorrhagic smallpox|409641002
is
usually fatal.[18]|399166001

Smallpox|67924001|243568000
is
caused|23981006|134198009
by infection
with variola virus,|243568000
which
belongs
to the genus Orthopoxvirus,|29724001
the family Poxviridae|424976006
and
subfamily chordopoxvirinae.|424428001

Variola|67924001
is
a large brick-shaped virus|255509001|107644003|49872002|255509001|107644003|255509001|300842002|49872002|255509001|300842002
measuring|258104002|263571004
approximately 302|26175008
to 350 nanometers|258675004
by 244
to 270 nm,[24]
with a single linear double stranded DNA genome 186 kilobase pairs (kbp)|37177003|50009006|1305003|18470003|304615006|125681006|50009006|13925004|18470003|304615006|50607009|50009006|13925004|18470003|304615006
in size|277049003
and
containing|42504009
a hairpin loop|261913007
at each end.|261782000|422117008

The two classic varieties|420797005|255301002|420797005|255333006
of smallpox|67924001|243568000
are
variola major|67924001|47452006
and
variola minor.|72294005

Four orthopoxviruses|421534005|29724001
cause|23981006|134198009
infection
in humans|278412004
:
variola,|67924001
vaccinia,|111852003|13126002
cowpox,|70090004
and
monkeypox.|359814004

Variola virus infects only humans|243568000|278412004
in nature,|277302009
although
primates|388073004
and
other animals|74964007|387961004
have
been
infected
in a laboratory setting.|261904005

Vaccinia,|111852003|13126002
cowpox,|70090004
and
monkeypox viruses|59774002
can
infect
both
humans|278412004
and
other animals|74964007|387961004
in nature.[18]|277302009

The lifecycle
of poxviruses|424976006
is
complicated|255302009
by
having
multiple infectious forms,|260396001|246176004
with differing mechanisms|257544000
of cell entry.|4421005|362837007

Poxviruses|424976006
are
unique
among DNA viruses|32478008
in
that
they
replicate|1305003|27582007
in the cytoplasm
of the cell|4421005|362837007
rather than
in the nucleus.|84640000

In order to
replicate|1305003|27582007
,
poxviruses|424976006
produce
a variety
of specialized proteins|67995009|88878007|88878007
not
produced
by other DNA viruses,|74964007|32478008
the most important|4757001
of which
is
a viral-associated DNA-dependent RNA polymerase.|47429007|74521006

Both
enveloped
and
unenveloped
virions|285296008
are
infectious.

The viral envelope|115427003
is
made
of modified Golgi membranes|90475001|243326001|90475001
containing|42504009
viral-specific polypeptides,|69658003|70354003
including|55919000
hemagglutinin.

Infection
with
either
variola major|67924001|47452006
or
variola minor|72294005
confers
immunity|58915005
against the other.[5]|74964007

Transmission|258150004
occurs|272120004
through inhalation|14910006|422237004
of airborne variola virus,|243568000
usually droplets
expressed
from the oral, nasal,|260548002|260540009|260548002
or
pharyngeal mucosa|46715004
of an infected person.|125676002

It
is
transmitted|60117003|258150004
from one person|421379005|125676002
to another primarily
through prolonged face-to-face contact|255224006|89545001|11723008|255224006|89545001|70862002|255224006|302549007|11723008|255224006|302549007|70862002
with an infected person,|125676002
usually
within a distance|246132006
of 6 feet|56459004|259051005
(1.8 m|260305007
)
,
but
can
also
be
spread|410677005
through direct contact|255589003|11723008|255589003|70862002
with infected bodily fluids|32457005|33463005
or
contaminated objects|62604006|260787004
(fomites
such as bedding
or
clothing.|272180002

Rarely,|103356009
smallpox|67924001|243568000
has
been
spread|410677005
by virus|49872002
carried|288345009
in the air|417696007
in enclosed settings|68947003
such as buildings,
buses,|22674006
and
trains.|62193008

The virus|49872002
can
cross|65145006
the placenta,|62669004|181455002
but
the incidence
of congenital smallpox|6160004|67924001|6160004|243568000|255399007|67924001|255399007|243568000
is
relatively low.|62482003|371880002

Smallpox|67924001|243568000
is
not notably infectious
in the prodromal period|259037005
and
viral shedding
is
usually
delayed
until the appearance|386548000|255412001
of the rash,|271807003
which
is
often|70232002
accompanied
by lesions
in the mouth|74262004|123851003|21082005|181220002
and
pharynx.|54066008|181211006

The virus|49872002
can
be
transmitted|60117003|258150004
throughout the course|288524001
of the illness,|39104002
but
is
most frequent|4757001|70232002
during the first week|255216001|258705008|255216001|259038000|232714002|258705008|232714002|259038000
of the rash,|271807003
when
most
of the skin lesions|95324001
are
intact.|11163003

Infectivity wanes
in 7
to 10 days|258703001
when
scabs|69640009
form|246176004
over the lesions,
but
the infected person|125676002
is
contagious
until the last smallpox scab|67924001|69640009|243568000|69640009
falls|1912002
off.[27]

Smallpox|67924001|243568000
is
highly contagious,|75540009
but
generally
spreads|410677005
more slowly|242762006|419443000
and
less widely|276139006|263796003
than some other viral diseases,
perhaps
because
transmission|258150004
requires
close contact|29179001|11723008|29179001|70862002
and
occurs|272120004
after the onset|77374008
of the rash.|271807003

The overall rate
of infection
is
also
affected|247591002|248448006
by the short duration|260402009
of the infectious stage.|21191007|371508000|261612004

In temperate areas,|42798000
the number|410680006|410681005
of smallpox infections|67924001|243568000
were
highest|75540009|371879000
during the winter
and
spring.

In tropical areas,|42798000
seasonal variation|21864008|40885006
was
less evident|276139006|18669006|263796003|18669006
and
the disease|64572001
was
present|52101004|246105001
throughout the year.|258707000|259039008

Age distribution|424144002|255464007
of smallpox infections|67924001|243568000
depends
on acquired immunity.|192360000

Vaccination immunity|58915005
declines
over time|410669006
and
is
probably
lost
in all
but
the most recently vaccinated populations.|4757001|6493001|385436007

Smallpox|67924001|243568000
is
not
known|36692007
to
be
transmitted|60117003|258150004
by insects|106763003
or
animals|387961004
and
there
is
no asymptomatic carrier state.[18]|84387000|29679002

The clinical definition|58147004
of smallpox|67924001|243568000
is
an illness|39104002
with acute onset|255363002
of fever|386661006
greater|263768009
than 101 ?F (38.3 ?C|372639009|264670000
)
followed|367409002
by a rash|271807003
characterized
by firm,|20583004
deep seated vesicles|131197000|33586001|82515000|131197000|360297006|82515000
or
pustules|271760008
in the same stage|262126009|21191007|262126009|371508000|262126009|261612004
of development|278923009
without other apparent cause.|74964007|134198009

If
a clinical case|58147004|398241000
is
observed,
smallpox|67924001|243568000
is
confirmed|59156000
using|260676000
laboratory tests.|269814003

Microscopically,
poxviruses|424976006
produce
characteristic cytoplasmic inclusions,|29015002
the most important|4757001
of which
are
known|36692007
as Guarnieri bodies,|24645001
and
are
the sites|10546003
of viral replication.|74256009

Guarnieri bodies|24645001
are
readily
identified|7882003
in skin biopsies|240977001
stained|397165007|127790008
with hematoxylin|12710003
and
eosin,|411353000
and
appear
as pink blobs.|371243003

They
are
found|404684003
in virtually
all poxvirus infections|32790009
but
the absence|2667000|418560003
of Guarnieri bodies|24645001
cannot
be
used|394850002
to
rule|10828004
out smallpox.|255529000|67924001|255529000|243568000

The diagnosis|439401001
of an orthopoxvirus infection|29724001
can
also
be
made
rapidly|418694008
by electron microscopic examination|46602004|117259009
of pustular fluid|255441005|32457005|255441005|33463005|255441005|255765007|255441005
or
scabs.|69640009

However,
all orthopoxviruses|29724001
exhibit
identical brick-shaped virions|20323000|107644003|285296008|20323000|300842002|285296008
by electron microscopy.[5]|73512001

Definitive laboratory identification|261002007|261904005|286672002|261002007|261904005|7882003
of variola virus|243568000
involves|248448006
growing
the virus|49872002
on chorioallantoic membrane|83097008
(part|260726005
of a chicken embryo|409910000|57991002|226955001|57991002
and
examining|64049009
the resulting pock|42752001
lesions
under defined temperature conditions.|105723007|260905004|246508008|260905004

Strains|48532005|276768000
may
be
characterized
by polymerase chain reaction (PCR)|258066000
and
restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis.|90603004

Serologic tests|68793005
and
enzyme linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA),|76978006
which
measure|246445000|272391002
variola virus-specific immunoglobulin|243568000|69658003|112133008|243568000|69658003|42441008
and
antigen|7120007
have
also
been
developed
to
assist|116697009|119265000
in the diagnosis|439401001
of infection.[30]

Chickenpox|38907003
was
commonly
confused|286933003
with smallpox|67924001|243568000
in the immediate post-eradication era.|88694003|288563008|49499008|288563008

Chickenpox|38907003
and
smallpox|67924001|243568000
can
be
distinguished
by several methods.|261028005|260686004|261028005|272394005

Unlike smallpox,|67924001|243568000
chickenpox|38907003
does
not usually
affect|4065008
the palms|107631008
and
soles.|57999000

Additionally,
chickenpox pustules|38907003|271760008
are
of varying size|277049003
due to variations|40885006
in the timing|246512002
of pustule eruption|271760008|271807003|271760008|1806006
:
smallpox pustules|67924001|271760008|243568000|271760008
are
all very nearly|260358002
the same size|262126009|277049003
since
the viral effect|253861007
progresses|385651009
more uniformly.|242762006

A variety
of laboratory methods|246367000
are
available|103328004
for detecting chickenpox|260373001|38907003
in evaluation|386053000
of suspected smallpox cases.[18]|67924001|398241000|67924001|413769002|243568000|398241000|243568000|413769002|415684004|67924001|398241000|415684004|67924001|413769002|415684004|243568000|398241000|415684004|243568000|413769002

Smallpox virus|243568000
lesions
on the chorioallantoic membrane|83097008
of a developing chick.

In contrast
to the rash|271807003
in smallpox,|67924001|243568000
the rash|271807003
in chickenpox|38907003
occurs|272120004
mostly
on the torso,|22943007
spreading|410677005
less
to the limbs.|66019005

The earliest procedure|264499004|71388002
used|394850002
to
prevent
smallpox|67924001|243568000
was
inoculation
(also
known|36692007
as variolation
).

Inoculation
was
possibly|60022001
practiced
in India|223600005
as
early|264499004
as 1000 BC,
[31]|264664006
and
involved|248448006
either
nasal insufflation|260540009|68641000|68641000
of powdered smallpox scabs,|85581007|67924001|69640009|85581007|243568000|69640009
or
scratching material|40590001|260769002|53181008|260769002
from a smallpox lesion|67924001|243568000
into the skin.|119325001|39937001|181469002

However,
the idea|363878000
that inoculation
originated
in India|223600005
has
been
challenged
as few
of the ancient Sanskrit medical texts|74188005
described
the process|415178003
of inoculation.

Accounts
of inoculation
against smallpox|67924001|243568000
in China|223581004
can
be
found|404684003
as early|264499004
as the late 10th century,|260383002
and
the procedure|71388002
was
widely
practiced
by the 16th century,
during the Ming Dynasty.

If successful, inoculation|385669000
produced
lasting immunity|58915005
to smallpox.|67924001|243568000

However,
because
the person|125676002
was
infected
with variola virus,|243568000
a severe infection|24484000
could
result|394617004
,
and
the person|125676002
could
transmit|60117003
smallpox|67924001|243568000
to others.|74964007

Variolation
had
a 0.5?2% mortality rate,|409651001
considerably less
than the 20?30% mortality rate|409651001
of the disease|64572001
itself.[18]

Lady Mary Wortley Montagu
observed
smallpox inoculation|67924001|243568000
during her stay
in the Ottoman Empire,
writing|12261009
detailed accounts
of the practice
in her letters,|126202002
and
enthusiastically
promoted
the procedure|71388002
in England|223664003
upon her return|7528007
in 1718.

In 1721,
Cotton Mather|51627003|91299008|54000004|256246007
and
colleagues
provoked|410658008
controversy
in Boston
by inoculating hundreds.

In 1796,
Edward Jenner,
a doctor|309343006
in Berkeley,
Gloucestershire,|223879008
rural England,|223664003
discovered
that immunity|58915005
to smallpox|67924001|243568000
could
be
produced
by inoculating
a person|125676002
with material|260769002
from a cowpox lesion.|70090004

Cowpox|70090004
is
a poxvirus|424976006|424428001
in the same family|262126009|35359004
as variola.|67924001

Jenner
called
the material|260769002
used|394850002
for inoculation vaccine,|398827000
from the root word _vacca_,|85077000|255373000|2338009|255373000
which
is
Latin
for cow.|34618005

The procedure|71388002
was
much safer|242762006|4757001
than variolation,
and
did
not
involve|248448006
a risk|30207005
of smallpox transmission.|67924001|258150004|243568000|258150004

Vaccination to
prevent
smallpox|67924001|243568000
was
soon
practiced
all over the world.

During the 19th century,
the cowpox virus|37362000
used|394850002
for smallpox vaccination|40001004
was
replaced|282089006|370124000
by vaccinia virus.|13126002

Vaccinia|111852003|13126002
is
in the same family|262126009|35359004
as cowpox|70090004
and
variola|67924001
but
is
genetically distinct
from both.

The origin|255395001
of vaccinia virus|13126002
and
how
it
came
to
be
in the vaccine|398827000
are
not
known.[18]|36692007

The current formulation|15240007
of smallpox vaccine|396439006
is
a live virus preparation|419749002|49872002|225106003|419749002|225106003
of infectious vaccinia virus.|13126002

The vaccine|398827000
is
given|419582001
using|260676000
a bifurcated|35127002
(two-pronged|420797005
)
needle|79068005
that
is
dipped|249558002|315316004
into the vaccine solution.|398827000|8537005|398827000|77899000

The needle|79068005
is
used to|394850002
prick|11639007|255353005
the skin|119325001|39937001|181469002
(usually
the upper arm|40983000|302538001
)
a number|410680006|410681005
of times|410669006|417929005
in a few seconds.|57176003|257997001

If successful,|385669000
a red|386713009|371240000
and
itchy bump|424492005
develops
at the vaccine site|398827000|10546003
in three|421291004
or
four days.|421534005|258703001

In the first week,|255216001|258705008|255216001|259038000|232714002|258705008|232714002|259038000
the bump
becomes
a large blister|255509001|408764000|255509001|247464001|255509001|417237009
(
called
a "Jennerian vesicle"|82515000
)
which
fills
with pus,|11311000|119323008
and
begins|255395001
to
drain.|32712000

During the second week,|81170007|258705008|81170007|259038000|257997001|258705008|257997001|259038000|288495006|258705008|288495006|259038000
the blister|408764000|247464001|417237009
begins|255395001
to
dry|13880007
up
and
a scab forms.|69640009|246176004

The scab falls|69640009|1912002
off
in the third week,|70905002|258705008|70905002|259038000
leaving|7771000|90737002
a small scar.[35]|255507004|70582006|255507004|275322007

The antibodies|68498002
induced|16404004
by vaccinia vaccine|111852003|13126002
are
cross-protective
for other orthopoxviruses,|74964007|29724001
such as monkeypox,|359814004
cowpox,|70090004
and
variola|67924001
(smallpox|67924001|243568000
)
viruses.|49872002

Neutralizing antibodies|260212000
are
detectable 10 days|258703001
after first-time vaccination,|255216001|410669006|232714002|410669006
and
seven days|420359007|258703001
after revaccination.

Historically,
the vaccine|398827000
has
been
effective|255403003|254648000
in preventing smallpox infection|67924001|243568000|116699007|67924001|116699007|243568000
in 95%
of those vaccinated.

Smallpox vaccination|40001004
provides
a high level|75540009|258395000|75540009|276625007|371879000|258395000|371879000|276625007
of immunity|58915005
for three to five years|421291004|421820001|258707000
and
decreasing immunity thereafter.|260371004|58915005

If
a person|125676002
is
vaccinated again later,
immunity lasts|58915005
even longer|255511005
.

Studies|110465008|224699009
of smallpox cases|67924001|398241000|67924001|413769002|243568000|398241000|243568000|413769002
in Europe|223502009
in the 1950s
and
1960s
demonstrated
that
the fatality rate|399166001
among persons|125676002
vaccinated
less
than 10 years|258707000
before exposure|71677004|24932003
was
1.3%|260305007
;
it
was
7%
among those vaccinated 11
to 20 years|258707000
prior,|236874000
and
11%
among those vaccinated 20
or
more years|242762006|258707000
prior to infection.

By contrast,
52%
of unvaccinated persons|125676002
died.[37]|419620001|419099009

There
are
side effects
and
risks|30207005
associated|47429007
with the smallpox vaccine.|396439006

In the past,|410513005
about 1
out of 1,000 people|260305007|125676002
vaccinated
for the first time|255216001|410669006|232714002|410669006
experienced
serious,|42745003
but
non-life-threatening, reactions|224130005|263851003
including|55919000
toxic
or
allergic reaction|421961002
at the site|10546003
of the vaccination
(erythema multiforme,|36715001
spread|410677005
of the vaccinia virus|13126002
to other parts|74964007|260726005
of the body,|279495008|123037004
and
to other individuals.|74964007|125676002|74964007|385435006

Potentially life-threatening reactions|224130005|263851003
occurred|272120004
in 14
to 500 people|125676002
out of every 1 million people|260305007|125676002
vaccinated
for the first time.|255216001|410669006|232714002|410669006

Based|418836005
on past experience,|410513005
it
is
estimated|414135002
that 1|260305007
or
2 people|260306008|125676002
in 1 million|260305007
(0.000198%
)
who
receive
the vaccine|398827000
may
die|419620001|399069006|419099009
as a result,|394617004
most often|70232002
the result|394617004
of postvaccinial encephalitis|45170000
or
severe necrosis|24484000|6574001
in the area|42798000
of vaccination
(called progressive vaccinia|255314001|111852003|255314001|13126002
).[36]

Given|419582001
these risks,|30207005
as
smallpox|67924001|243568000
became
effectively
eradicated
and
the number|410680006|410681005
of naturally occurring cases|272120004|398241000|272120004|413769002
fell|1912002
below the number|410680006|410681005
of vaccine-induced illnesses|398827000|16404004|39104002
and
deaths,|419620001|268923008
routine childhood vaccination|50811001|68433009
was
discontinued|410546004
in the United States|223688001
in 1972,
and
was
abandoned|385657008
in most European countries|223633000
in the early 1970s.|264499004

Routine vaccination|50811001
of health care workers
was
discontinued|410546004
in the U.S.|223688001

in 1976,
and
among military recruits|302314004
in 1990
(
although
military personnel deploying|302314004
to the Middle East|223605000
and
Korea still|38361009
receive
the vaccination.[39]
)
By 1986,
routine vaccination|50811001
had
ceased
in all countries.|223369002

It
is
now primarily
recommended
for laboratory workers|261904005|106541005
at risk|410519009
for occupational exposure.[18]|87923000|71677004|87923000|24932003

Smallpox vaccination|40001004
within three days|421291004|258703001
of exposure|71677004|24932003
will
prevent
or
significantly
lessen
the severity|272141005
of smallpox symptoms|67924001|243568000
in the vast majority
of people.|125676002

Vaccination four|421534005
to seven days|420359007|258703001
after exposure|71677004|24932003
can
offer|410527000
some protection
from disease|64572001
or
may
modify|243326001
the severity|272141005
of disease.|64572001

Other than vaccination,
treatment|276239002|416118004
of smallpox|67924001|243568000
is
primarily supportive,
such as wound care|225358003
and
infection control,|77248004
fluid therapy,|32457005|276239002|33463005|276239002|255765007|276239002|276239002
and
possible ventilator assistance.|371930009|116697009|371930009|23562009|116697009|60022001|116697009|60022001|23562009|116697009

Flat|6041008|257564005
and
hemorrhagic types|255345002|261664005
of smallpox|67924001|243568000
are
treated|28995006
with the same therapies|262126009|276239002
used|394850002
to
treat|395077000
shock,|27942005
such as fluid resuscitation.

People|125676002
with semi-confluent|74832004
and
confluent types|74832004|261664005
of smallpox|67924001|243568000
may
have
therapeutic issues|262202000|55607006
similar
to patients|116154003
with extensive skin burns.[40]|41118005|284196006|259031006

No drug|410942007
is
currently|15240007
approved|9571008
for the treatment|276239002|416118004
of smallpox.|67924001|243568000

However,
antiviral treatments|372701006|276239002
have
improved|385425000|3442003
since
the last large smallpox epidemics,|255509001|67924001|255509001|243568000
and
studies|110465008|224699009
suggest
that
the antiviral drug cidofovir|372701006|386894007
might
be
useful
as a therapeutic agent.|5487002

The drug|410942007
must
be
administered|418283001
intravenously,
however,
and
may
cause|23981006|134198009
serious kidney toxicity.[41]|42745003|236514003

The overall case-fatality rate|409653003
for ordinary-type smallpox|67924001|261664005
is
about 30%,
but
varies
by pock distribution|255464007
:
ordinary type-confluent|261664005|74832004
is
fatal|399166001
about 50?75%
of the time,|410669006
ordinary-type semi-confluent|261664005|74832004
about 25?50%
of the time,|410669006
in cases|398241000|413769002
where the rash|271807003
is
discrete
the case-fatality rate|409653003
is
less
than 10%.

The overall fatality rate|399166001
for children|410601007|160499008
younger|84422007
than 1 year|260305007|258707000|260305007|259039008
of age|424144002
is
40%?50%.|259031006

Hemorrhagic|255345002
and
flat types|6041008|261664005|257564005|261664005
have
the highest fatality rates.|75540009|399166001|371879000|399166001

The fatality rate|399166001
for flat-type|6041008|261664005|257564005|261664005
is
90%|264705001|264703008
or
greater|263768009
and
nearly 100%
is
observed
in cases|398241000|413769002
of hemorrhagic smallpox.|409641002

The case-fatality rate|409653003
for variola minor|72294005
is
1%|260305007
or
less.|276139006|263796003

There
is
no evidence|18669006
of chronic|90734009
or
recurrent infection|255227004
with variola virus.[21]|243568000

In fatal cases|399166001|398241000|399166001|413769002
of ordinary smallpox,|67924001
death usually|419620001|268923008
occurs|272120004
between the tenth|28226006
and
sixteenth days|258703001
of the illness.|39104002

The cause|134198009
of death|419620001|268923008
from smallpox|67924001|243568000
is
not
clear|263707001
,
but
the infection
is
now
known|36692007
to
involve|248448006
multiple organs.|260396001|410653004

Circulating immune complexes,|23369004
overwhelming
viremia,|2528003
or
an uncontrolled immune response|19032002|35024006
may
be
contributing factors.

In early hemorrhagic smallpox,|264499004|409641002
death|419620001|268923008
occurs|272120004
suddenly
about six days|422218008|258703001
after the fever|386661006
develops.

Cause|134198009
of death|419620001|268923008
in hemorrhagic cases|255345002|398241000|255345002|413769002
involved|248448006
heart failure,|84114007|42343007
sometimes
accompanied
by pulmonary edema.|19242006

In late hemorrhagic cases,|260383002|255345002|398241000|260383002|255345002|413769002
high|75540009|371879000
and
sustained viremia,|263892007|2528003
severe platelet loss|24484000|16378004|24484000|61928009
and
poor immune response|11403006|35024006|255351007|35024006
were
often|70232002
cited
as causes|134198009
of death.|419620001|268923008

In flat smallpox modes|6041008|67924001|6041008|243568000|257564005|67924001|257564005|243568000
of death|419620001|268923008
are
similar
to those in burns,|52101004|125666000|18720000|125666000
with loss
of fluid,|32457005|33463005|255765007
protein|88878007
and
electrolytes|86355000
beyond the capacity
of the body to|279495008|123037004
replace|282089006|370124000
or
acquire|255396000
,
and
fulminating sepsis.[40]|105592009|259031006|91302008|259031006

Complications|116223007
of smallpox|67924001|243568000
arise|68727004
most commonly
in the respiratory system|20139000|278197002
and
range
from simple bronchitis|13673007|32398004
to fatal pneumonia.|399166001|205237003

Respiratory complications|62907002
tend
to
develop
on about
the eighth day|51601003|258703001|51601003|259032004
of the illness|39104002
and
can
be
either
viral
or
bacterial|409822003
in origin.|255395001

Secondary bacterial infection|2603003|301811001|81170007|301811001
of the skin|119325001|39937001|181469002
is
a relatively uncommon complication|103356009|116223007|103356009|263718001
of smallpox.|67924001|243568000

When
this
occurs|272120004
,
the fever usually|386661006
remains
elevated.[18]|75540009

Other complications|116223007
include|55919000
encephalitis|45170000
(1
in 500 patients|116154003
)
,
which
is
more common|242762006|72906007
in adults|133936004
and
may
cause|23981006|134198009
temporary disability|14803004|21134002
;
permanent pitted scars,|6934004|79261008|70582006|6934004|79261008|275322007|6934004|77855009|70582006|6934004|77855009|275322007
most notably
on the face|89545001|302549007
;
and
complications|116223007
involving|248448006
the eyes|81745001
(2%|260306008
of all cases|398241000|413769002
).

Pustules|271760008
can
form|246176004
on the eyelid,|80243003|265782007
conjunctiva,|29445007|181161008
and
cornea,|28726007|181162001
leading|236874000
to complications|116223007
such as conjunctivitis,|9826008
keratitis,|5888003
corneal ulcer,|91514001
iritis,|65074000
iridocyclitis,|77971008
and
optic atrophy.|76976005

Blindness
results|394617004
in approximately 35%|26175008
to 40%|259031006
of eyes|81745001
affected|247591002|248448006
with keratitis|5888003
and
corneal ulcer.|91514001

Hemorrhagic smallpox|409641002
can
cause|23981006|134198009
subconjunctival|264206001
and
retinal hemorrhages.|28998008

In 2%|260306008
to 5%|264706000|264605009
of young children|84422007|410601007|84422007|160499008
with smallpox,|67924001|243568000
virions|285296008
reach|282679008
the joints|39352004|81087007
and
bone,|272673000|3138006|90780006|128530007
causing|23981006
_osteomyelitis variolosa_.|60168000

Lesions
are
symmetrical,|18772005
most common|72906007
in the elbows,|127949000
tibia,|12611008|182061009
and
fibula,|87342007|302529003
and
characteristically
cause|23981006|134198009
separation|16640008|160788005
of an epiphysis|43719000

marked periosteal reactions.|46998006|261158002|263851003|46998006|420047004|263851003

Swollen joints|271771009
limit|255469002
movement,|255324009
and
arthritis|3723001
may
lead|88488004
to limb deformities,|445144002
ankylosis,|111227009
malformed bones,|276654001|272673000|276654001|128530007
flail joints,|239762007
and
stubby fingers.[5]|7569003|259052003

The date|410671006
of the appearance|386548000|255412001
of smallpox|67924001|243568000
is
not
settled.|128719006

It most likely|4757001|2931005
evolved|59381007
from a rodent virus|388077003|49872002|388077003
between 68,000|264697007
and
16,000 years ago.|258707000

The wide range|90522003
of dates|410671006
is
due to the different records|263735002
used|394850002
to
calibrate
the molecular clock.|290005005

One clade|421379005
was
the variola major strains|67924001|48532005|67924001|276768000|47452006|48532005|47452006|276768000
(
the more clinically severe form|242762006|24484000|246176004
of smallpox|67924001|243568000
)
which
spread|410677005
from Asia|223500001
between 400
and
1,600 years ago.|260305007|258707000

A second clade|81170007|257997001|288495006
included|55919000
both
alastrim|72294005
minor|410599005|255606000
(
a phenotypically mild smallpox|255604002|67924001|255604002|243568000
)
described
from the American continents|223497007
and
isolates|46651001
from West Africa|8124001
which
diverged
from an ancestral strain|48532005|276768000
between 1,400|260305007
and
6,300 years|258707000
before present.|52101004|246105001

This clade further|46053002
diverged
into two|420797005
subclades
at least 800 years ago.|276139006|258707000|263796003|258707000

A second estimate|81170007|414135002|257997001|414135002|288495006|414135002
has
placed|257557008|421066005
the separation|16640008|160788005
of variola|67924001
from Taterapox
at 3000?4000 years ago.|258707000

This
is
consistent|385433004
with archaeological
and
historical evidence|18669006|392521001|18669006
regarding
the appearance|386548000|255412001
of smallpox|67924001|243568000
as a human disease|278412004|64572001
which
suggests
a relatively recent origin.|6493001|255395001

However
if
the mutation rate|55446002
is
assumed to
be
similar
to that
of the herpesviruses|128377001
the divergence date|263741009|410671006
between variola|67924001
from Taterapox
has
been
estimated|414135002
to
be
50,000 years ago.|258707000

While
this
is
consistent|385433004
with the other published estimates|74964007|414135002
it
suggests
that
the archaeological
and
historical evidence|18669006|392521001|18669006
is
very incomplete.|260358002|255599008|260358002|255609007

Better estimates|3442003|414135002
of mutation rates|55446002
in these viruses|49872002
are
needed.|410525008|103325001

It
seems
to
have
emerged
in its endemic form|246176004
in India 2500?3000 years ago.|223600005|258707000

The variola virus|243568000
was
transferred|129347002
from West Africa|8124001
to South America|223504005
in the 19th century._[clarification

The earliest credible clinical evidence|264499004|58147004|18669006
of smallpox|67924001|243568000
is
found|404684003
in the Egyptian mummy|297308004|1919006
of Ramses V
who
died|419620001|419099009
over 3000 years ago|258707000
(1145 BCE
).

Historical records|392521001
from Asia|223500001
describe
evidence|18669006
of smallpox-|67924001|243568000
like disease|64572001
in medical writings|74188005
from ancient India|223600005
(
as
early|264499004
as 1500 BCE
)
[46]
and
China|223581004
(1122 BCE

It
has
been
speculated
that Egyptian traders|297308004|1919006
brought|68369002
smallpox|67924001|243568000
to India|223600005
during the 1st millennium BC,|255216001
where
it
remained
as an endemic human disease|86820007|278412004
for
at least 2000 years.|276139006|258707000|263796003|258707000

Smallpox|67924001|243568000
was
probably
introduced|127487003
in China|223581004
during the 1st century AD|255216001
from the southwest,
and
in the 6th century
was
carried|288345009
from China|223581004
to Japan.|223583001

In Japan,|223583001
the epidemic
of 735?737
is
believed to
have
killed|248007002
up to one-third|421379005|70905002
of the population.|385436007|389109008

At least seven religious deities|276139006|420359007|62458008|263796003|420359007|62458008
have
been
specifically
dedicated
to smallpox,|67924001|243568000
such as the god Sopona
in the Yoruba religion.|440659006|440659006|160538000

In India,|223600005
the Hindu goddess|61154002|160545000
of smallpox,|67924001|243568000
Sitala Mata,|50501003
was
worshiped
in temples|31287004
throughout the country.[49]|223369002

The arrival
of smallpox|67924001|243568000
in Europe|223502009
and
south-western Asia|223500001
is
less
clear.|263707001

Smallpox|67924001|243568000
is
not
described
in
either
the Old|70753007
or
New Testaments|7147002
of the Bible,
or
in literature
of the Greeks|1451003
and
Romans.|223655008

Scholars
agree
it
is
very unlikely|260358002
such a serious disease|42745003|64572001
as variola major|67924001|47452006
would
have
escaped
a description
by Hippocrates
if
it
existed
in the Mediterranean region.|410673009

While
the Antonine Plague|58750007
that swept
through the Roman Empire|223655008
in 165?180 AD
may
have
been
caused|23981006|134198009
by smallpox,|67924001|243568000
[51] other historians|78826004
speculate
that Arab armies first|90027003|255216001|90027003|232714002
carried smallpox|288345009|67924001|288345009|243568000
out of Africa|223498002
to Southwestern Europe|223502009
during the 7th
and
8th centuries AD.

In the 9th century
the Persian physician,|309343006
Rhazes,
provided one|421379005
of the most definitive observations|4757001|261002007|103705002
of smallpox|67924001|243568000
and
was
the first to|255216001|232714002
differentiate|263933003
smallpox|67924001|243568000
from measles|14189004
and
chickenpox|38907003
in his _Kitab fi al-jadari wa-al-hasbah_|421908005
(_
The Book|278212002
of Smallpox|67924001|243568000
and
Measles_|14189004
).

During the Middle Ages,|28288005
smallpox|67924001|243568000
made
periodic incursions|81591007
into Europe|223502009
but
did
not
become
established|263748003|385645004
there
until the population|385436007|389109008
increased|35105006|260366006
and
population movement|385436007|255324009|389109008|255324009
became
more active|242762006|55561003
during the time|410669006
of the Crusades.

By the 16th century smallpox|67924001|243568000
was
well established|20572008|263748003|20572008|385645004
over most
of Europe.|223502009

With its introduction|107733003
in populated areas|42798000
in India,|223600005
China|223581004
and
Europe,|223502009
smallpox|67924001|243568000
affected|247591002|248448006
mainly children,|410601007|160499008
with periodic epidemics|81591007
that
killed|248007002
up to 30%
of those infected.

The appearance|386548000|255412001
of smallpox|67924001|243568000
in Europe|223502009
is
of particular importance,
as
successive waves
of European exploration|414152003|122458006|122458006
and
colonization
served
to
spread|410677005
the disease|64572001
to other parts|74964007|260726005
of the world.

By the 16th century
it
had
become
an important cause|134198009
of morbidity
and
mortality|409651001
in the known world.[22]|36692007

There
are
no credible descriptions
of smallpox-|67924001|243568000
like disease|64572001
in the Americas
before the westward exploration|122458006
by Europeans|414152003
in the 15th century AD.

In 1507 smallpox|67924001|243568000
was
introduced|127487003
into the Caribbean island|288560006
of Hispaniola
and
to the mainland
in 1520,
when
Spanish settlers
from Hispaniola
arriving
in Mexico brought smallpox|223687006|68369002|67924001|223687006|68369002|243568000
with them.

Smallpox|67924001|243568000
devastated
the native Amerindian population|263818007|385436007|263818007|389109008
and
was
an important factor
in the conquest
of the Aztecs|67931002
and
the Incas|55990000
by the Spaniards.|28409002

Settlement
of the east coast
of North America|223503004
in 1633
in Plymouth,
Massachusetts|224066008
was
also
accompanied
by devastating outbreaks|443684005
of smallpox|67924001|243568000
among Native American populations,|413490006|385436007
[53]
and
subsequently
among the native-born colonists.|263818007|106970005|263818007|81827009|263818007|398209006

Some estimates|414135002
indicate|410535002
case fatality rates|409653003
of 80?90%|264705001|264703008
in Native American populations|413490006|385436007
during smallpox epidemics.|67924001|243568000

Smallpox|67924001|243568000
was
introduced|127487003
into Australia|223621005
in 1789
and
again
in 1829.

Although
the disease|64572001
was
never endemic
on the continent,|261001000|223497007
[22]
it
was
the principal cause|63161005|134198009|302311007|134198009
of death|419620001|268923008
in Aboriginal populations|385436007
between 1780
and
1870.[56]

By the mid-18th century smallpox|255562008|67924001|255562008|243568000
was
a major endemic disease everywhere|255603008|86820007
in the world
except
in Australia|223621005
and
in several small islands.|261028005|255507004|288560006

In Europe smallpox|223502009|67924001|223502009|243568000
was
a leading cause|236874000|134198009
of death|419620001|268923008
in the 18th century,
killing|248007002
an estimated 400,000 Europeans|414135002|414152003|414135002
each year.|258707000|259039008

Through the century smallpox|67924001|243568000
resulted|42752001|394617004
in the deaths|419620001|268923008
of perhaps 10%
of all
the infants|418119000
of Sweden|223681007
every year,|258707000|259039008
[8]
and
the death rate|409651001
of infants|418119000
in Russia|223656009
may
have
been
even higher.|75540009|371879000

The widespread use|85333001|277889008|85333001|419385000
of variolation
in a few countries,|57176003|223369002
notably Great Britain,|223861009
its North American colonies,|160516002|258736000
and
China,|223581004
somewhat
reduced|260400001
the impact|134293005
of smallpox|67924001|243568000
among the wealthy classes|224166006|258391009
during the latter part|260726005
of the 18th century,
but
a real reduction|58294000|260400001|289928003
in its incidence
did
not
occur|272120004
until vaccination
became
a common practice|72906007
toward the end|261782000|422117008
of the 19th century.

Improved vaccines|385425000|398827000|3442003|398827000
and
the practice
of re-vaccination|228877007
led|88488004|236874000
to a substantial reduction|58294000|260400001|289928003
in cases|398241000|413769002
in Europe|223502009
and
North America,|223503004
but
smallpox|67924001|243568000
remained
almost
unchecked
everywhere
else
in the world.

In the United States|223688001
and
South Africa|223549008
a much milder form|242762006|255604002|246176004|4757001|255604002|246176004
of smallpox,|67924001|243568000
_variola minor_,|72294005
was
recognized
just
before the close|29179001
of the 19th century.

By the mid-20th century _variola minor_|255562008|72294005
occurred|272120004
along
with _variola major_,|67924001|47452006
in varying proportions,|8212001
in many parts|260726005
of Africa.|223498002

Patients|116154003
with _variola minor_ experience only|72294005
a mild systemic illness,|255604002|264578000
are
often|70232002
ambulant
throughout the course|288524001
of the disease,|64572001
and
are
therefore able to more easily spread disease.|371150009|36203004|410677005|64572001

Infection
with _v.

minor_|410599005|255606000
induces|16404004
immunity|58915005
against the more deadly _variola major_ form.|242762006|67924001|246176004|242762006|47452006|246176004

Thus
as
_v.

minor_|410599005|255606000
spread|410677005
all over the USA,|223688001
into Canada,|223686002
the South American countries|223712004
and
Great Britain|223861009
it
became
the dominant form|246176004
of smallpox,|67924001|243568000
further reducing mortality rates.|46053002|260400001|409651001

Since
English physician Edward Jenner|297487008|309343006|25804004|309343006
demonstrated
the effectiveness|255403003
of cowpox to|70090004
protect
humans|278412004
from smallpox|67924001|243568000
in 1796,
various attempts|256220008
were
made
to
eliminate
smallpox|67924001|243568000
on a regional scale.|410673009|19892000|410673009|278111002|255470001|19892000|255470001|278111002

As
early|264499004
as 1803,
the Spanish Crown|261516009|75628001
organized|385650005
a mission
(
the Balmis expedition to
transport|57188001|360300001
the vaccine|398827000
to the Spanish colonies|258736000
in the Americas
and
the Philippines,|223592003
and
establish|263748003
mass vaccination|300848003|118538004
programs
there.

The
US Congress
passed
the Vaccine|398827000
Act
of 1813 to
ensure
that safe smallpox vaccine|396439006
would
be
available|103328004
to the American public.

By about 1817,
a very solid state vaccination program|260358002|35702001|398070004|260358002|78910004|398070004|260358002|421378002|398070004
existed
in the Dutch East Indies.|9533000|223589002

In British India|223600005
a program
was
launched
to
propagate
smallpox vaccination,|40001004
through Indian vaccinators,
under the supervision|225313009|119270007
of European officials.|414152003

Nevertheless,
British vaccination efforts|19487008
in India,|223600005
and
in Burma|223587000
in particular,
were
hampered
by stubborn indigenous preference|225773000
for inoculation
and
distrust
of vaccination,
despite
tough legislation,
improvements
in the local efficacy|255470001
of the vaccine|398827000
and
vaccine|398827000
preservative,|418403001
and
education efforts.|266981003|19487008|409073007|19487008

By 1832,
the federal government
of the United States|223688001
established|263748003|385645004
a smallpox vaccination program|40001004
for Native Americans.|413490006

In 1842,
the United Kingdom banned inoculation,|223860005
later
progressing|255314001
to mandatory vaccination.

The British government
introduced|127487003
compulsory smallpox vaccination|12479006|40001004
by an
Act
of Parliament
in 1853.|264645000

In the United States,|223688001
from 1843
to 1855 first Massachusetts,|255216001|224066008|232714002|224066008
and
then other states|398070004
required
smallpox vaccination.|40001004

Although
some
disliked
these measures,|246445000|367346004
[47] coordinated efforts|162258009|19487008
against smallpox|67924001|243568000
went
on,
and
the disease|64572001
continued|255238004
to
diminish|1250004
in the wealthy countries.|224166006|223369002

By 1897,
smallpox|67924001|243568000
had
largely
been
eliminated
from the United States.|223688001

In Northern Europe|223502009
a number|410680006|410681005
of countries|223369002
had
eliminated smallpox|67924001|243568000
by 1900,
and
by 1914,
the incidence
in most industrialized countries|223369002
had
decreased|1250004|260400001|260371004
to comparatively low levels.|62482003|258395000|371880002|258395000

Vaccination
continued|255238004
in industrialized countries,|223369002
until
the mid|255562008
to late 1970s|260383002
as protection
against reintroduction.

Australia|223621005
and
New Zealand|223625001
are
two notable exceptions|420797005
;
neither
experienced endemic smallpox|67924001|243568000
and
never
vaccinated
widely,
relying
instead
on protection
by distance|246132006
and
strict quarantines.[65]|170499009|264695004

The first hemisphere-wide effort|255216001|90522003|19487008|232714002|90522003|19487008
to eradicate smallpox|67924001|243568000
was
made
in 1950
by the Pan American Health Organization.|389223000|263775005|21139007

The campaign
was
successful|385669000
in eliminating smallpox|67924001|243568000
from all American countries|223369002
except Argentina,|223713009
Brazil,|223715002
Colombia,|223717005
and
Ecuador.|223718000

In 1958 Professor Viktor Zhdanov,
Deputy Minister|11015003
of Health|263775005
for the USSR,
called
on the World Health Assembly to|263775005
undertake
a global initiative to|60132005|247756008
eradicate
smallpox.|67924001|243568000

The proposal
(Resolution WHA11.54
)
was
accepted|385645004
in 1959.

At this point,
2 million people|260306008|125676002
were
dying|399069006
from smallpox|67924001|243568000
every year.|258707000|259039008

Overall,
however,
the progress|385651009
towards eradication
was
disappointing,
especially
in Africa|223498002
and
in the Indian subcontinent.|223506007

In 1966
an international team,
the Smallpox Eradication Unit,|67924001|258666001|243568000|258666001
was
formed|35810008
under the leadership
of an American,
Donald Henderson.

In 1967,
the World Health Organization|263775005|21139007
intensified
the global smallpox eradication|60132005|67924001|60132005|243568000
by contributing $2.4 million annually|53281000
to the effort,|19487008
and
adopted|160496001
the new disease surveillance method|7147002|64572001|225419007|260686004|7147002|64572001|225419007|272394005
promoted
by Czech epidemiologist Karel Ra?ka.[69][70]|286009|264698002

In the early 1950s|264499004
an estimated 50 million cases|414135002|398241000|414135002|413769002
of smallpox|67924001|243568000
occurred|272120004
in the world
each year.|258707000|259039008

To
eradicate
smallpox,|67924001|243568000
each outbreak|443684005
had
to
be
stopped|385654001
from spreading,|410677005
by isolation|40174006|46651001
of cases|398241000|413769002
and
vaccination
of everyone
who
lived|224130005|419749002
close|29179001
by.

This process|415178003
is
known|36692007
as "ring vaccination".|112627000|257380004

The key
to this strategy
was
monitoring|302805002
of cases|398241000|413769002
in a community|133928008
(
known|36692007
as surveillance|225419007
)
and
containment.

The initial problem|884001|55607006|232714002|55607006
the WHO team
faced|89545001|302549007
was
inadequate reporting|71978007|223458004
of smallpox cases,|67924001|398241000|67924001|413769002|243568000|398241000|243568000|413769002
as
many cases|398241000|413769002
did
not
come
to the attention|6769007
of the authorities.

The fact
that humans|278412004
are
the only reservoir|50607009|257687008|420295001|257687008
for smallpox infection,|67924001|243568000
and
that carriers|47461006
did
not
exist
,
played|300776002
a significant role|386134007
in the eradication
of smallpox.|67924001|243568000

The
WHO
established|263748003|385645004
a network
of consultants
who
assisted|371152001
countries|223369002
in setting
up surveillance|225419007
and
containment activities.|257733005

Early|264499004
on donations
of vaccine|398827000
were
provided
primarily
by the Soviet Union
and
the United States,|223688001
but
by 1973,
more
than 80%
of all vaccine|398827000
was
produced
in developing countries.[65]|223369002|264695004

The last major European outbreak|255603008|414152003|443684005|255603008|443684005
of smallpox|67924001|243568000
was
in 1972
in Yugoslavia,|223684004
after
a pilgrim
from Kosovo
returned|7528007
from the Middle East,|223605000
where
he
had
contracted|78558002
the virus.|49872002

The epidemic infected 175 people,|125676002
causing|23981006
35 deaths.|419620001|268923008

Authorities
declared
martial law,
enforced quarantine,|170499009
and
undertook widespread re-vaccination|85333001|228877007
of the population,|385436007|389109008
enlisting
the
help
of the
WHO.

In two months,|420797005|258706009
the outbreak|443684005
was
over.|21481007

Prior to this,
there
had
been
a smallpox outbreak|67924001|443684005|243568000|443684005
in May?July 1963
in Stockholm,
Sweden,|223681007
brought|68369002
from the Far East|223580003
by a Swedish sailor
;
this
had
been
dealt
with
by quarantine measures|170499009|246445000|170499009|367346004
and
vaccination
of the local population.[72]|255470001|385436007|255470001|389109008

By the end|261782000|422117008
of 1975,
smallpox|67924001|243568000
persisted
only
in the Horn|69221006
of Africa.|223498002

Conditions|260905004
were
very difficult|260358002|52925006
in Ethiopia|223517008
and
Somalia,|223528007
where there
were
few roads.|57176003|272510001

Civil war,|257874000
famine,
and
refugees|446654005
made
the task even more difficult.|52925006

An intensive surveillance|225419007
and
containment
and
vaccination program
was
undertaken
in these countries|223369002
in early|264499004
and
mid-1977,|255562008
under the direction|260672003
of Australian microbiologist Frank Fenner.|159138004

As the campaign
neared|277752003
its goal,|410518001
Fenner
and
his team
played|300776002
an important role
in verifying eradication.

The
last naturally
occurring|272120004
case|398241000
of indigenous smallpox|67924001|243568000
(_Variola minor_|72294005
)
was
diagnosed|439401001
in Ali Maow Maalin,
a hospital cook|106373003|285201006|106373003
in Merca,
Somalia,|223528007
on 26 October 1977.

The
last naturally
occurring|272120004
case|398241000
of the more deadly _Variola major_|242762006|67924001|242762006|47452006
had
been
detected|260373001
in October 1975
in a two-year-old Bangladeshi girl,|420797005|258707000|70753007|186003008|431549007|420797005|259039008|70753007|186003008|431549007
Rahima Banu.[23]|264657009

The global eradication|60132005
of smallpox|67924001|243568000
was
certified
,
based|418836005
on intense verification activities|103370009|257733005
in countries,|223369002
by a commission
of eminent scientists|308027003
on 9 December 1979
and
subsequently
endorsed
by the World Health Assembly|263775005
on 8 May 1980.

The first two sentences|255216001|420797005|232714002|420797005
of the resolution
read|50360004
:

The last cases|398241000|413769002
of smallpox|67924001|243568000
in the world
occurred|272120004
in an outbreak|443684005
of two cases|420797005|398241000|420797005|413769002
(one|421379005
of which
was
fatal|399166001
)
in Birmingham,
UK
in 1978.

A medical photographer,|74188005|308017009
Janet Parker,
contracted|78558002
the disease|64572001
at the University of Birmingham Medical School|224871002|74188005|257698009
and
died|419620001|419099009
on September 11,
1978,
[75]
after which
the scientist responsible|308027003|394851003
for smallpox research|67924001|243568000
at the university,|224871002
Professor Henry Bedson,|304612009
committed suicide.|44301001

In light|56242006|371268001
of this incident,
all known stocks|36692007
of smallpox|67924001|243568000
were
destroyed
or
transferred|129347002
to one|421379005
of two|420797005
WHO
reference
laboratories|261904005
which
had
BSL-4 facilities
;
the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|26216008|64572001|31509003|169443000
(CDC
)
in the United States|223688001
and
the State Research Center|398070004|26216008
of Virology|76018003
and
Biotechnology VECTOR|260529001
in Koltsovo,
Russia.[76]|223656009

In 1986,
the World Health Organization first|263775005|21139007|255216001|263775005|21139007|232714002
recommended destruction|64597002
of the virus,|49872002
and
later
set
the date|410671006
of destruction to|64597002
be
30 December 1993.

This
was
postponed
to 30 June 1999.

Due to resistance|30714006
from the
US
and
Russia,|223656009
in 2002
the World Health Assembly|263775005
agreed
to
permit|958006
the temporary retention|14803004|36850000
of the virus stocks|49872002
for specific research purposes.|69658003|363675004

Destroying existing stocks
would
reduce|260400001
the risk|30207005
involved|248448006
with ongoing smallpox research|255238004|67924001|255238004|243568000
;
the stocks
are
not
needed|410525008|103325001
to
respond
to a smallpox outbreak.|67924001|443684005|243568000|443684005

Some scientists|308027003
have
argued
that
the stocks
may
be
useful
in developing new vaccines,|7147002|398827000
antiviral drugs,|372701006
and
diagnostic tests,|103693007
[80] however,
a 2010 review
by a team
of public health experts|310115006
appointed
by the World Health Organization|263775005|21139007
concluded
that
no essential public health purpose|34325006|310115006|363675004
is
served
by the
US
and
Russia continuing to|223656009|255238004
retain|397909002
virus stocks.|49872002

The latter view|246516004
is
frequently|70232002
supported|9096001|243114000
in the scientific community,|133928008
particularly
among veterans
of the
WHO Smallpox Eradication Program.[82]|67924001|243568000

In March 2004 smallpox scabs|67924001|69640009|243568000|69640009
were
found|404684003
tucked|10942006
inside an envelope
in a book|278212002
on Civil War medicine|257874000|410942007
in Santa Fe,
New Mexico.|420979006

The envelope
was
labeled
as containing scabs|42504009|69640009
from a vaccination
and
gave|419582001
scientists|308027003
at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|26216008|64572001|31509003|169443000
an opportunity to
study|110465008|224699009
the history|392521001
of smallpox vaccination|40001004
in the
US.

The British
at least
considered
using|260676000
smallpox|67924001|243568000
as a biological warfare agent
at the Siege
of Fort Pitt
during the French|19434008
and
Indian Wars
(1754?63
)
against France|223666001
and
its Native American allies.|413490006

Although
it
is
not
clear|263707001
whether
the actual use|277889008|419385000
of smallpox|67924001|243568000
had
official sanction,
on June 24,
1763,
William Trent,
a local trader,|255470001
wrote,|12261009
"
Out of our regard
for them [sc.

representatives
of the besieging Delawares],
we
gave|419582001
them
two|420797005
Blankets|19328000
and
an Handkerchief
out of the Small Pox Hospital.|67924001|67924001|285201006|243568000|243568000|285201006

I hope|42146005|247798006|22971001|247798006
it
will
have
the desired effect."[86][87] Historians|253861007|78826004
do
not
agree
on
whether
this effort to|19487008
broadcast
the disease|64572001
was
successful.|385669000

It
has
also
been
alleged
that smallpox|67924001|243568000
was
used|394850002
as a weapon|312201009
during the American Revolutionary War
(1775?83
).[88][89]

During World War II,
scientists|308027003
from the United Kingdom,|223860005
United States|223688001
and
Japan|223583001
(Unit 731|258666001
of the imperial Japanese army|414551003
)
were
involved|248448006
in research
into producing
a biological weapon
from smallpox.|67924001|243568000

Plans|52713000|397943006
of large scale production|255509001|19892000|255509001|278111002
were
never
carried|288345009
through
as
they
considered
that
the weapon|312201009
would
not
be
very effective|260358002|255403003|260358002|254648000
due to the wide-scale availability|90522003|19892000|103328004|90522003|278111002|103328004
of a vaccine.[91]|398827000

In 1947
the Soviet Union
established|263748003|385645004
a smallpox weapons|67924001|312201009|243568000|312201009
factory|257605002
in the city|284560003
of Zagorsk,
75 km
to the northeast
of Moscow.

An outbreak|443684005
of weaponized smallpox|67924001|243568000
occurred|272120004
during testing|272393004
at a facility
on an island|288560006
in the Aral Sea|225742004
in 1971.

General Prof.|60132005

Peter Burgasov,
former Chief Sanitary Physician|9130008|309343006
of the Soviet Army
and
a senior researcher
within the Soviet program
of biological weapons,
described
the incident
:

Others|74964007
contend
that
the first patient|255216001|116154003|232714002|116154003
may
have
contracted|78558002
the disease|64572001
while
visiting
Uyaly
or
Komsomolsk-
on-Ustyurt,
two cities|420797005|284560003
where the boat|257418003
docked.[95][96]|17272006|257598001

Responding
to international pressures,|279046003|13543005
in 1991
the Soviet government
allowed
a joint|39352004|81087007|302536002
US-British inspection team|32750006
to tour four|282987006|421534005
of its main weapons facilities|63161005|312201009
at Biopreparat.

The inspectors
were
met|229057006
with evasion
and
denials|78222005
from the Soviet scientists,|308027003
and
were
eventually
ordered
out of the facility.

In 1992 Soviet defector Ken Alibek|223534000
alleged
that
the Soviet bioweapons
program
at Zagorsk
had
produced
a large stockpile?|255509001
as
much
as twenty tons?|258691001
of weaponized smallpox|67924001|243568000
(possibly|60022001
engineered|106269003
to
resist
vaccines,|398827000
Alibek further alleged|46053002
)
,
along
with refrigerated warheads to
deliver
it.

Alibek's stories
about the former Soviet program's smallpox activities|9130008|67924001|257733005|9130008|243568000|257733005
have
never
been
independently
verified.

In 1997,
the Russian government|297514005|85163001
announced
that
all
of its remaining smallpox samples|67924001|123038009|243568000|123038009
would
be
moved|384598002|370125004
to the Vector Institute|260529001|385437003
in Koltsovo.

With the breakup
of the Soviet Union
and
unemployment|73438004
of many|260396001
of the weapons program's scientists,|312201009|308027003
US government officials
have
expressed
concern
that smallpox|67924001|243568000
and
the expertise to
weaponize
it
may
have
become
available|103328004
to other governments|74964007
or
terrorist groups|257877007|261586004|257877007|160481000
who
might
wish
to
use|277889008|419385000
virus|49872002
as means|255586005
of biological warfare.|12893009

Specific allegations|69658003
made
against Iraq|223608003
in this respect,
however,
proved|277025001
to
be
false.[99]|64100000

Concern
has
been
expressed
by some
that artificial gene synthesis|71967004|67271001|11798007
could
be
used|394850002
to
recreate
the virus|49872002
from existing digital genomes,|261006005|18470003|82680008|18470003
for use|277889008|419385000
in biological warfare.|12893009

Insertion|71861002|257867005
of the synthesized smallpox DNA|67924001|24851008|243568000|24851008
into existing related pox viruses|272151006|424976006|262094002|424976006
could
theoretically
be
used|394850002
to
recreate
the virus.|49872002

The first step|255216001|398298007|232714002|398298007
to mitigating|6736007
this risk,|30207005
it
has
been
suggested
,
should
be
to
destroy
the remaining virus|49872002
stocks|228184002
so|223528007
as to
enable|225791005
unequivocal criminalization
of any possession
of the virus.[101]|49872002

,
[103] George Washington|421908005
(survived
)
,
king
Louis XV
in 1774
(
died|419620001|419099009
)
and
Maximilian III Joseph,|257471003
Elector
of Bavaria
in 1777.

Prominent families|4657009|35359004
throughout the world often|70232002
had
several people|261028005|125676002
infected
by
and/or
perish
from the disease.|64572001

For example,
several relatives|261028005|125677006
of Henry VIII|304612009|262270007
survived
the disease|64572001
but
were
scarred|70582006|275322007
by it.

These
include|55919000
his sister Margaret,|27733009
Queen
of Scotland,|223678002
his fourth wife,|29970001|127850001
Anne
of Cleves,
and
his two daughters|420797005|66089001
:
Mary I|42146005|22971001
of England|223664003
in 1527
and
Elizabeth I|42146005|22971001
of England|223664003
in 1562
(
as an adult|133936004
she
would
often|70232002
try
to
disguise
the pockmarks
with heavy makeup|410712002
).

His great-niece,|255509001|34581001|263768009|34581001
Mary,
Queen
of Scots,
contracted|78558002
the disease|64572001
as a child|410601007|160499008
but
had
no visible scarring.|24054004|24054004|275322007

In Europe,|223502009
deaths|419620001|268923008
from smallpox often|67924001|70232002|243568000|70232002
changed dynastic succession.|243326001|263703002

The only|50607009|420295001
surviving
son|65616008
of Henry VIII,|304612009|262270007
Edward VI,|262261009
died|419620001|419099009
from complications shortly|116223007
after
apparently recovering|74822006
from the disease,|64572001
thereby
nullifying
Henry's efforts to|304612009|19487008
ensure
a male successor|248153007
to the throne
(
his immediate successors|88694003|49499008
were
all females|248152002
).

Louis XV
of France|223666001
succeeded
his great-grandfather Louis XIV|50261002
through a series|13039001
of deaths|419620001|268923008
of smallpox|67924001|243568000
or
measles|14189004
among those earlier|264499004
in the succession line.|50009006

He
himself
died|419620001|419099009
of the disease|64572001
in 1774.

William III|257471003
lost
his mother|72705000
to the disease|64572001
when
he
was
only ten years old|50607009|23067006|258707000|70753007|50607009|420258001|258707000|70753007|420295001|23067006|258707000|70753007|420295001|420258001|258707000|70753007
in 1660,
and
named|27468005
his uncle Charles|38048003
as legal guardian|58626002
:
her death|419620001|268923008
from smallpox|67924001|243568000
would
indirectly
spark
a chain|46666003
of events|272379006
that
would
eventually
lead|88488004
to the permanent ousting|6934004
of the Stuart line|50009006
from the British throne.

William III's wife,|257471003|127850001
Mary II
of England,|223664003
died|419620001|419099009
from smallpox|67924001|243568000
as well.|20572008

In China,|223581004
the Qing Dynasty
had
extensive protocols to|41118005|258049002
protect
Manchus
from Peking's endemic smallpox.|67924001|243568000

U.S.|223688001

Presidents George Washington,|421908005
Andrew Jackson,
and
Abraham Lincoln|261667003
all
contracted|78558002
and
recovered|74822006
from the disease.|64572001

Washington|421908005
became
infected
with smallpox|67924001|243568000
on a visit
to Barbados|223700003
in 1751.

Jackson
developed
the illness|39104002
after
being
taken prisoner|419652001
by the British
during the American Revolution,|257875004
and
though
he
recovered,|74822006
his brother Robert|70924004
did
not.

Lincoln
contracted|78558002
the disease|64572001
during his Presidency,
possibly|60022001
from his son Tad,|65616008
and
was
quarantined|170499009
shortly
after
giving|419582001
the Gettysburg address|397635003
in 1863.[104]

Famous theologian Jonathan Edwards
died|419620001|419099009
of smallpox|67924001|243568000
in 1758
following|255260001
an inoculation.[105]

Soviet leader Joseph Stalin
fell|1912002
ill|367391008
with smallpox|67924001|243568000
at the age|424144002
of seven.|420359007

His face|89545001|302549007
was
badly|556001
scarred|70582006|275322007
by the disease.|64572001

He later
had
photographs|257444003
retouched
to
make
his pockmarks less apparent.[106]

Hungarian poet Ferenc K?lcsey,|297923001
who
wrote|12261009
the Hungarian national anthem,|297923001
lost
his right eye|18944008
to smallpox.[107]|67924001|243568000

As a reaction|263851003
to the devastation
of smallpox,|67924001|243568000
smallpox gods|67924001|243568000
and
goddesses
were
invented
as a mechanism to|257544000
cope|405056001
with the disease.|64572001

Two examples|420797005
of this
occurred|272120004
in China|223581004
and
India.|223600005

In China,|223581004
the smallpox goddess|67924001|243568000
was
referred|439980006
to
as
T?ou-Shen Niang-Niang.

The Chinese actively|297876005|33897005
worked|261041009
to
please
the goddess
and
thus
keep
the disease|64572001
at bay.|21024008

For example,
the Chinese|297876005|33897005
referred|439980006
to the smallpox pustules|67924001|271760008|243568000|271760008
as "beautiful flowers"|106148006|16719004|271712005|16719004|272144002|16719004
;
this
was
an attempt
to
not
offend
the goddess
and
keep
her happy.|112080002

The Chinese also|297876005|33897005
took|419652001
great measure to|255509001|246445000|255509001|272391002|263768009|246445000|263768009|272391002
protect
children|410601007|160499008
from the dangers
of smallpox|67924001|243568000
by tricking
their smallpox goddess.|67924001|243568000

It
was
believed
that
the goddess
enjoyed|112080002
passing
the disease|64572001
to attractive children.|410601007|160499008

This transmission|258150004
was
most likely to|4757001|2931005
occur|272120004
on the last night|2546009
of the year,|258707000|259039008
so
children|410601007|160499008
wore
ugly
masks|261382003
to bed to|229772003
trick
the goddess
into passing over|21481007
them.

If infection
of smallpox|67924001|243568000
did
occur|272120004
,
shrines
were
set up|255532002|353734004
in the homes|261770009
of the victims.

These shrines
were
worshipped
and
offerings
made
to
while
the victim
was
sick.

If
the victim
recovered|74822006
,
the shrines
were
taken|419652001
away
from the home|261770009
in a special handmade paper chair|67995009|50833004
or
boat|257418003
and
burned.|125666000

If
the patient|116154003
did
not
recover|74822006
,
the shrine
was
destroyed
and
curses
were
used|394850002
to
remove|127485006
the goddess
from the house.[108]|261770009|257630004

India?s first|223600005|255216001|223600005|232714002
records
of smallpox|67924001|243568000
can
be
found|404684003
in a medical book|74188005|278212002
that
dates|410671006
back
to A.D.|876000

400.

This book|278212002
describes
a disease|64572001
that
sounds
exceptionally
like smallpox.|67924001|243568000

India,|223600005
like China,|223581004
created
a goddess
in response
to its exposure|71677004|24932003
to smallpox.|67924001|243568000

The Hindu goddess Shitala|61154002|160545000
was
both
worshipped
and
feared|1402001
during her reign.

It
was
believed
that
this goddess
was
both
evil
and
kind|261664005
and
had
the ability to|371150009
inflict
victims
when
angered|75408008
,
as well as
calm|386226007
the fevers|386661006
of the already
afflicted.

Portraits
of the goddess
show
her holding
a broom|261340002
in her right hand to|78791008|368455003
continue|255238004
to
move|302000008|384598002|370125004
the disease|64572001
and
a pot
of cool water|11713004|119318008
in the other hand|74964007|85562004|74964007|302539009
in an attempt to
soothe
victims.

Shrines
were
created
where many India natives,|223600005|263818007
both
healthy|263775005
and
not,
went
to worship
and
attempt
to
protect
themselves
from this disease.|64572001

Some Indian women,|224526002
in an attempt
to ward|225746001
off Shitala,
placed plates|257557008|271003|421066005|271003
of cooling foods|255620007
and
pots
of water|11713004|119318008
on the roofs|224738009
of their homes.[111]|261770009

In medieval times,|410669006|417929005
several countries|261028005|223369002
held|421139008
a belief
in the smallpox demon,|67924001|243568000
who
was
blamed
for the disease.|64572001

Such beliefs
were
prominent|4657009
in Japan,|223583001
Europe,|223502009
Africa,|223498002
and
other parts|74964007|260726005
of the world.

Nearly
all
cultures|252398009|61594008
who
believed
in the demon also
believed
that
it
was
afraid|1402001
of the color red,|263714004|386713009|263714004|371240000
and
people|125676002
would
often|70232002
dress|228204008
in red hoping to|386713009|371240000
scare
off the demon
and
cure smallpox.|67924001|243568000

The belief
in the color red's ability to|263714004|386713009|371150009|263714004|371240000|371150009
treat|395077000
smallpox|67924001|243568000
persisted
until the 1930s.
