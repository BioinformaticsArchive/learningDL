*,
derived
from the Greek words|1451003|255373000
for "dry skin,|16386004
"
is
a condition|260905004
involving|248448006
the integumentary system,|48075008
which
in most cases|398241000|413769002
can
safely
be
treated|28995006
with emollients|373380003
and/or
moisturizers.

Xeroderma|52475004
occurs|272120004
most commonly
on the scalp,|41695006|181480002
lower legs,|40927001
arms,|40983000
the knuckles,|70420003
the sides|182353008
of the abdomen|277112006|52731004|302553009
and
thighs.|68367000

Symptoms most
associated|47429007
with xeroderma|52475004
are
scaling|271767006
(
the visible peeling|24054004|257890000|24054004|51979000
of the outer skin layer|261074009|314820002
)
,
itching|424492005
and
skin cracking.[1]|95321009

Xeroderma|52475004
is
a very common condition.|260358002|72906007|260905004

It
happens
more often|242762006|70232002
in the winter
where the cold air|256234008
outside
and
the hot air|264018002|417696007
inside
creates
a low relative humidity.|44974002|125677006|44974002|29920004|62482003|250829009|371880002|250829009

This
causes|134198009
the skin to|119325001|39937001|181469002
lose
moisture|17461003
and
it
may
crack
and
peel.|257890000|51979000

Bathing|129002005|60369001
or
hand washing|258154008
too frequently,|70232002
especially
if
one|421379005
is
using|260676000
harsh soaps,|76412005|25780000
may
also
contribute
to xeroderma.|52475004

Xeroderma|52475004
can
also
be
caused|23981006|134198009
by a deficiency|260372006|248325000
of vitamin A,|82622003
vitamin D,|71516007|30178006
systemic illness,|264578000
severe sunburn,|24484000|23346002
or
some medication.|410942007

Xeroderma|52475004
can
also
be
caused|23981006|134198009
by choline inhibitors.|65123005|61511001

Detergents|264299001
like washing powder|85581007
and
washing
up liquid|33463005|264312008
can
also
cause|23981006|134198009
xeroderma.|52475004

Since
the development|278923009
of Nivea Skin Creme|119325001|39937001|181469002
by German pharmacists|7695005|46255001
in the late 1800s,|260383002
a huge array
of topical skin moisturizers|119325001|39937001|181469002|359540000|119325001|359540000|39937001|359540000|181469002
have
been
introduced|127487003
on the worldwide market.|284440009

Today,
many excellent creams|425405005|255621006
and
lotions,|17519006
commonly
based|418836005
on vegetable oils/butters,|412552006|226888007
petroleum oils/jellys,|11699009
and
even lanolin[3]|42416001
are
widely available.|103328004

As a preventative measure,|246445000|272391002
such products
may
be
rubbed
onto the affected area|247591002|42798000|248448006|42798000
as needed|410525008|103325001
(often|70232002
every other day|74964007|258703001|74964007|259032004
)
to
prevent
dry skin.|16386004

Use|277889008|419385000
a pat towel technique|54638004|272394005
when
drying|257791009
off to
prevent
removal|118292001|128303001
of natural lipids|510009|70106000
from the skin.[4]|119325001|39937001|181469002

Repeated application|27582007|410618006
(typically
over a few days|57176003|258703001
)
of emollients|373380003
and or
skin lotions/creams|421628006|17519006
to the affected area|247591002|42798000|248448006|42798000
will
likely|2931005
result|394617004
in quick alleviation|255358001
of xeroderma.|52475004

In particular, application|410618006
of highly occlusive barriers|75540009|263823007
to moisture,|17461003
such as petrolatum,|25307002
vegetable oils/butters,|412552006|226888007
and
mineral oil|111089004
have
been
shown
to
provide
excellent results.|425405005|394617004

Many individuals also|260396001|125676002|260396001|385435006
find
specific commercial skin creams|69658003|421628006
and
lotions|17519006
(often comprising oils,|70232002|21847005
butters,|226888007
and or
waxes|69637009
emulsified
in water|11713004|119318008
)
quite effective|255403003|254648000
(
although
individual preferences|125676002|225773000|385435006|225773000
and
results|394617004
vary
among the wide array|90522003
of commercially available creams|103328004|255621006
).

Lanolin,|42416001
a natural mixture|510009|272163001
of lipids|70106000
derived
from sheep's wool,|260206005
helps
replace|282089006|370124000
natural lipids|510009|70106000
in human skin|278412004|119325001|278412004|39937001|278412004|181469002
and
has
been
used|394850002
since ancient times|410669006|417929005
(
and
in modern medicine|410942007
)
as
among the most powerful treatments|4757001|33300005|276239002
for xeroderma.|52475004

However,
pure lanolin|42416001
is
a thick waxy substance|246703001|69637009|105590001|246703001|41508009|105590001
which,
for many individuals,|125676002|385435006
proves|277025001
difficult|52925006
and
inconvenient
for general use|60132005|277889008|60132005|419385000
on dry skin|16386004
(especially over large areas|21481007|255509001|42798000
of the body|279495008|123037004
).

As a result,|394617004
many formulated lanolin products,|42416001
having
a softer consistency|37378003|107646001
than pure lanolin,|42416001
are
available[6]|103328004
(
see|281004000
external links|261074009
below
and or
consult|11429006
a pharmacist|46255001
for recommendations
concerning
commercially available speadable formulations|103328004
comprising
lanolin|42416001
