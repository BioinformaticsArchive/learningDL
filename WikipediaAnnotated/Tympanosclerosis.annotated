as

or

)
is
a condition|260905004
caused|23981006|134198009
by calcification
of tissues|85756007
in the middle ear,|25342003|181185000
sometimes
resulting|42752001
in a detrimental effect|253861007
to hearing.[1][2]|47078008|118230007

_Myringosclerosis_ refers|439980006
to a calcification only
within the tympanic membrane|42859004|181180005
and
is
usually less extensive|41118005
than _intratympanic tympanosclerosis_,|23606001
which
refers|439980006
to any other location|74964007|246267002
within the middle ear|25342003|181185000
such as the ossicular chain,|41845008
middle ear mucosa|25342003|313268005|181185000|313268005
or
,
less frequently,|276139006|70232002|263796003|70232002
the mastoid cavity.[3]|59066005|80967001|59066005|91806002|59066005|2483006|265784008|80967001|265784008|91806002|265784008|2483006

Few symptoms|57176003
present|52101004|246105001
as a result|394617004
of tympanosclerosis.|23606001

Myringosclerosis rarely|103356009
results|394617004
with any symptoms.

Tympanosclerosis,|23606001
on the other hand,|74964007|85562004|74964007|302539009
can
result|394617004
with significant hearing loss[3]|386134007|386134007|343087000|386134007|15188001
or
chalky,|387499002|418016005
white patches|413773004|36875001|185984009|36875001|371251000|36875001
on the middle ear|25342003|181185000
or
temporal membrane.[1]|255570003|83097008

The aetiology|134198009
for tympanosclerosis|23606001
is
not extensively
understood.|66216009

There
are
several probable factors|261028005|2931005
which
could
result|394617004
in the condition appearing,|260905004
including|55919000
:

Increased fibroblast activity|28277004|52547004
results|394617004
in deposition|46595003
of collagen.|61472002

Calcium phosphate plaques_[disambiguation|44044007|38551001
needed|410525008|103325001
_] then
form|246176004
in the lamina propria|88446008
of the tympanic membrane.[1][2]|42859004|181180005

If lesions
are
typical, non-extensive|41118005
and
with no detriment
to hearing,|47078008|118230007
investigation|386053000
into the condition|260905004
is
rarely|103356009
required.

Audiometry|21727005
is
used to|394850002
determine
the extent|255590007
of hearing loss,|343087000|15188001
if
any.

Tympanometry|91573000
produces
tympanograms
which
can
be
different|263735002
when
tympanosclerosis|23606001
is
present.|52101004|246105001

Computerised tomography (CT)|77477000
can
be
used|394850002
to
determine
if disease|64572001
is
present|52101004|246105001
in the middle ear.|25342003|181185000

Whilst
hearing loss|343087000|15188001
is
a common symptom|72906007
in many diseases|64572001
of the ear,|117590005|1910005
for example
in otosclerosis|11543004
(abnormal bone growth|263654008|272673000|263654008|3138006|263654008|90780006|263654008|128530007
in the ear|10547007
)
,
[3]|260313008
the white,|413773004|185984009|371251000
chalky|387499002|418016005
patches|36875001
on the tympanic membrane|42859004|181180005
are
fairly characteristic
of tympanosclerosis.|23606001

Cholesteatoma|363668000
is
similar
in appearance|386548000|255412001
but
the whiteness|413773004|185984009|371251000
is
behind the tympanic membrane,|42859004|181180005
rather than
inside._[citation|260521003

Hearing aids|6012004
are
a common treatment|72906007|276239002|72906007|416118004
for hearing loss disorders.|128540005

A more specific treatment|242762006|69658003|276239002|242762006|69658003|416118004
is
surgical,|83578000
involving|248448006
excision|118292001|128303001
of the sclerotic areas|43846000|42798000|255444002|42798000
and
then further|46053002
repair|298005009|4365001
of the ossicular chain.|41845008

There
are
several techniques,|261028005|272394005
sometimes
involving|248448006
two surgeries|420797005|83578000
;[2][13] success rates|260306008|385669000
are
,
however,
variable.|255372005

Damage|37782003
to the inner ear|302462009|181189006
as a result|394617004
of surgerical procedures|71388002
is
a possible|371930009|60022001
and
serious concern,|42745003
as
it
can
result|394617004
in forms|246176004
of sensorineural deafness.[17]|60700002

In most cases,|398241000|413769002
tympanosclerosis|23606001
does
not
cause|23981006|134198009
any recognisable hearing loss|343087000|15188001
up to ten years|23067006|258707000|420258001|258707000
after the initial disease onset.|884001|217315002|232714002|217315002

Sclerotic changes|43846000|243326001|43846000|263703002|255444002|243326001|255444002|263703002
seem
to stablise,
but
not
resolve
or
dissolve,|421682005
after
3 years.[9][19]|260282009|258707000

Myringosclerosis
seems
to
be
more common|242762006|72906007
than tympanosclerosis.|23606001

Most research
has
not
been
conducted|844005
upon the general, healthy population,|105724001|385436007|105724001|389109008
but
rather
those
with otitis media|65363002
or
patients|116154003
who
have
had
tympanostomy tubes|397760009|83059008|397760009|418530008
in prior procedures.|236874000|71388002

Of the children|410601007|160499008
studied|110465008|224699009
who
had
'glue ear',
and
who
were
treated|28995006
with tympanostomy tubing,|397760009
23-40%|264657009|259031006
of cases|398241000|413769002
had
tympanosclerosis.|23606001

One study|421379005|110465008|421379005|224699009
suggested
that people|125676002
with atherosclerosis|38716007
were
more likely to|242762006|2931005
have
tympanosclerosis|23606001
than otherwise healthy individuals.[10]|263775005|125676002|263775005|385435006
