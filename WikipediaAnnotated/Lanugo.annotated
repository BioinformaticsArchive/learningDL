is
fine, downy hair|3082000|247524003
which
can
be
described
as a type|261664005
of fur.|29292008

It
is
often|70232002
found|404684003
in teratomas|55818009
(congenital tumours|6160004|108369006|255399007|108369006
).

During human development,|278412004|278923009
the lanugo|247524003
grows
on fetuses
as a normal part|17621005|260726005|258744000|260726005
of gestation,|289908002
but
is
usually
shed
and
replaced|282089006|370124000
by vellus hair|89714002|319720006
at about 33|264667004
to 36 weeks|258705008
of gestational age.|57036006

As the lanugo|247524003
is
shed
from the skin,|119325001|39937001|181469002
it
is
normal|17621005|258744000
for the developing fetus to|83418008
consume
the hair|386045008|119326000
with the fluid,|32457005|33463005|255765007
since
it
drinks|226465004
from the amniotic fluid|77012006
and
urinates
it
back
into its environment.|276339004

Subsequently,
the lanugo|247524003
contributes
to the newborn baby's meconium.|133933007|28112009

The presence|386397008
of lanugo|247524003
in newborns|133933007
is
a sign|72670004
of premature birth.|282020008

A hypothesis,
according to the NHS,|445257004
is
that
the lanugo|247524003
of human fetuses|278412004
has
to do
with temperature regulation.[1]|180333002

Lanugo|247524003
can
be
observed
in malnourished patients,|248325000|116154003
including|55919000
those
with eating disorders.|72366004

When
found|404684003
along
with other physical symptoms,|74964007|5880005|74964007|19388002
for example lanugo|247524003
can
help
a physician|309343006
make
a diagnosis|439401001
of anorexia nervosa.[2]|56882008

Lanugo|247524003
is
also common|72906007
on other animals.|74964007|387961004

For example,
seals[3]|19314006|106980009
and
elephants[4][5][6]|81716003
are
often|70232002
born|106970005|81827009|398209006
with a covering|255334000
of lanugo.|247524003

Fetal whales,|106981008|20689007
like humans|278412004
and
all other primates,|74964007|388073004
also
have
lanugo.|247524003
