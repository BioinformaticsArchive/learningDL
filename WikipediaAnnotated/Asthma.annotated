*Asthma|195967001
*
*
(
from the Greek ?????,|1451003
_?sthma_,
"panting"|248581005
)
is
the common chronic inflammatory disease|72906007|128294001
of the airways|43725001|89187006
characterized
by variable|255372005
and
recurring symptoms,|246455001|255227004
reversible airflow obstruction,|35174006|4601000|26036001
and
bronchospasm.|4386001

Symptoms
include|55919000
wheezing,|56018004
coughing|272039006
,
chest tightness,|23924001
and
shortness|359530003|367450005
of breath.|11891009

Asthma|195967001
is
clinically
classified|73504009
according to the frequency|260864003|272123002
of symptoms,
forced expiratory volume|165041004
in 1 second|260305007|81170007|260305007|257997001|260305007|288495006
(FEV1,
and
peak expiratory flow rate.|18491006

Asthma|195967001
may
also
be
classified|73504009
as atopic|115665000
(extrinsic|261074009|255400000
)
or
non-atopic|115665000
(intrinsic|260521003|255406006
).[4]|260308009

It
is
thought to|88952004
be
caused|23981006|134198009
by a combination|89780004
of genetic|3950001|255395001
and
environmental factors.|102487004

Treatment|276239002|416118004
of acute symptoms|272118002
is
usually
with an inhaled short-acting beta-2 agonist|14910006|359530003|52095000|102498003|14910006|359530003|260989008|102498003|14910006|367450005|52095000|102498003|14910006|367450005|260989008|102498003
(
such as salbutamol.|372897005

Symptoms
can
be
prevented|116699007
by avoiding triggers,
such as allergens[7]|90260006
and
irritants,|412453003
and
by inhaling corticosteroids.|14910006|79440004

Leukotriene antagonists|372517002
are
less effective|276139006|255403003|276139006|254648000|263796003|255403003|263796003|254648000
than corticosteroids|79440004
and
thus less
preferred.[9]|225773000

Its diagnosis|439401001
is
usually
made
based|418836005
on the pattern|272135003
of symptoms
and/or
response
to therapy|276239002
over time.|410669006

The prevalence
of asthma|195967001
has
increased|35105006|260366006
significantly
since
the 1970s.

As of 2010,
300 million people|125676002
were
affected|247591002|248448006
worldwide.

In 2009 asthma|195967001
caused|23981006|134198009
250,000 deaths globally.[12]|419620001|268923008

Asthma|195967001
is
characterized
by recurrent episodes|263853000
of wheezing,|56018004
shortness|359530003|367450005
of breath,|11891009
chest tightness|23924001
and
coughing.|272039006

Symptoms
are
often worse|70232002|230993007|70232002|390772001|70232002|231877006
at night|2546009
and
in the early morning,|264499004|73775008
or
in response to
exercise|61686008
or
cold air.|256234008

Some people|125676002
with asthma only rarely|195967001|103356009
experience
symptoms,
usually
in response
to triggers,
whereas
other
may
have
marked|46998006
persistent airflow obstruction.[15]|4601000|26036001

A number|410680006|410681005
of other health conditions|74964007|263775005|260905004
occur|272120004
more frequently|242762006|70232002
in those with asthma|20401003|195967001|421463005|195967001
including|55919000
:
gastro-esophageal reflux disease (GERD),|235595009
rhinosinusitis,
and
obstructive sleep apnea.|78275009

Psychological disorders|74732009
are
also more common.[17]|72906007

Asthma|195967001
is
caused|23981006|134198009
by environmental|276339004
and
genetic factors.|3950001|255395001

These factors
influence
how severe asthma|370221004
is
and
how well|20572008
it
responds
to medication.|410942007

The interaction
is
complex|103360007
and
not fully
understood.|66216009

It
is
believed
that
the recent increased rates|6493001|35105006|6493001|260366006
of asthma over|195967001|21481007
are
due to epigenetic
or
environmental changes.[20]|276339004|243326001|276339004|263703002

Many environmental risk factors|102487004
have
been
associated|47429007
with asthma development|195967001|278923009
and
exacerbations
in children.|410601007|160499008

There
is
a relationship|272151006
between exposure|71677004|24932003
to air pollutants|417696007
(e.g.|258795003

from traffic
)
and
asthma|195967001
in children.|410601007|160499008

Maternal tobacco smoking|72705000|365981007
during pregnancy|289908002
and
after delivery|236973005|118215003
is
associated|47429007
with a greater risk|263768009|30207005
of asthma-like symptoms,|195967001
wheezing,|56018004
and
respiratory infections|275498002
during childhood.|68433009

Low air quality,|62482003|417696007|263496004|371880002|417696007|263496004
from traffic pollution|102410009
or
high ozonelevels,|75540009|371879000
[23]|264657009
has
been
repeatedly|27582007
associated|47429007
with increased asthma morbidity|35105006|195967001|260366006|195967001
and
has
been
association|263534001|272151006
with asthma development.|195967001|278923009

Both
the occurrence|272120004
of the disease|64572001
and
exacerbation
of childhood asthma|233678006
are
affected|247591002|248448006
by outdoor air pollutants.|417696007

High levels|75540009|258395000|371879000|258395000
of endotoxin exposure|18127008|71677004|18127008|24932003
may
contribute
to asthma risk.[25]|195967001|30207005

Much allergic asthma|389145006
is
associated|47429007
with sensitivity|35209006|365705006
to indoor allergens|90260006
and
because Western styles
of housing favor greater exposure|414418009|263768009|71677004|414418009|263768009|24932003
to indoor allergens,|90260006
much attention|6769007
has
focused|87017008|363702006
on increased exposure|35105006|71677004|35105006|24932003|260366006|71677004|260366006|24932003
to these allergens|90260006
in infancy|3658006
and
early childhood|264499004|68433009
as a primary cause|63161005|23981006|63161005|134198009|261424001|23981006|261424001|134198009
of the rise
in asthma.|195967001

Primary prevention studies|315233008|110465008|315233008|224699009
aimed
at the reduction|58294000|260400001|289928003
of airborne allergens|90260006
in the home|261770009
have
shown
mixed findings.|26242008|404684003|26242008

Reduction|58294000|260400001|289928003
of dust mite allergens,|260147004|90260006
for example,
reduces|260400001
the risk|30207005
of allergic sensitization|416167002
to dust mites,|260147004
and
modestly
reduces|260400001
the risk|30207005
of developing asthma|195967001
up
until
the age|424144002
of 8 years old.|258707000|70753007

However,
studies|110465008|224699009
also
showed
that
the effects|253861007
of exposure|71677004|24932003
to cat|448169003|33384004|388626009
and
dog allergens|448771007|90260006|90260006
worked|261041009
in the converse fashion
;
exposure|71677004|24932003
during the first year|255216001|258707000|255216001|259039008|232714002|258707000|232714002|259039008
of life|224130005
was
found|404684003
to _
reduce|260400001
_
the risk|30207005
of allergic sensitization|416167002
and
of developing asthma later in life.[28][29][30]|195967001|260383002|224130005

Viral respiratory infections|312133006
are
one|421379005
of the leading triggers|236874000
of an exacerbation
and
may
also
increase|260366006
the risk|30207005
of developing asthma especially|195967001
in young children.|84422007|410601007|84422007|160499008

Indoor allergens|90260006
may
also
play|300776002
a role
with common ones|72906007|421379005
including|55919000
:
dust mites,|260147004
cockroaches,
animal dander|264287008
and
molds.[33]|84489001|264667004

Psychological stress
may
worsen|230993007|390772001
asthma symptoms.|195967001

It
is
thought|88952004
that stress|262188008
modulates|261019009
the immune system to|116003000
increase|260366006
the magnitude|246173007|272100000
of the airway inflammatory response|43725001|89187006
to allergens|90260006
and
irritants.[24][34]|412453003

Beta blocker medications|373254001|410942007
such as metoprolol|372826007
may
trigger|410658008
asthma|195967001
in those
who
are
susceptible.[35]|131196009

Indoor exposure|71677004|24932003
to volatile organic compounds (VOCs)|115543007|41175001
may
be
one|421379005
trigger|410658008
of asthma|195967001
with formaldehyde exposure|212898003
being
positively
associated.|47429007

Phthalates
in PVC|251175005
is
associated|47429007
with asthma|195967001
in children|410601007|160499008
and
adults.[37][38]|133936004|264670000

There
is
a link
between asthma|195967001
and
the degree|258395000|246173007
of affluence.|224166006

This
could
possibly|60022001
be
due to the 'hygiene factor',|284779002
whereby
lack|41277001
of childhood exposure|68433009|71677004|68433009|24932003
to some environmental irritants|276339004|412453003
increases|260366006
the sensitivity|35209006|365705006
of susceptible people to|131196009|125676002
develop
asthma|195967001
on later exposure.|260383002|71677004|260383002|24932003

Asthma deaths however|195967001|419620001|195967001|268923008
are
most common|4757001|72906007
in low|62482003|371880002
and
middle income countries,|255562008|223369002|399488007|223369002
.

Most likely|4757001|2931005
due to income
and
geography,
the incidence
of
and
treatment quality|276239002|263496004|416118004|263496004
for asthma|195967001
varies
among different racial groups.|263735002|415229000

The prevalence
of "severe persistent" asthma|426656000
is
also greater|263768009
in low-income communities|133928008|424860001|133928008
than those
with better access|3442003|260507000
to treatment.[41][42]|276239002|416118004

One theory|421379005
for the cause|134198009
of the increase|260366006
in asthma prevalence worldwide|195967001
is
the hygiene hypothesis[31] ?|284779002|264664006
that
the rise
in the prevalence
of allergies|421961002
and
asthma|195967001
is
a direct|255589003
and
unintended result|394617004
of reduced exposure|260400001|71677004|260400001|24932003
to a wide variety|90522003
of different bacteria|263735002|409822003
and
virus types|277234002
in modern societies,
or
modern hygienic practices|284779002
preventing|116699007
childhood infections.[43]|68433009

Children|410601007|160499008
living|224130005|419749002
in less hygienic environments|276139006|284779002|276339004|263796003|284779002|276339004
(East Germany|223637004
vs.

West Germany,|223637004
[44] families|35359004
with many children,|410601007|160499008
[45] day care environments[46]|258703001|224793003|259032004|224793003
)
tend
to
have
lower incidences|261122009
of asthma|195967001
and
allergic diseases.|64572001

This
seems
to
run|418060005|282476009
counter|303502004
to the logic
that viruses|49872002
are
often causative agents|70232002|362944004
in exacerbation
of asthma.[47][48][49]Additionally,|195967001
other studies|74964007|110465008|74964007|224699009
have
shown
that viral infections|34014006
of the lower airway|261122009|43725001|261122009|89187006
may
in some cases _|398241000|413769002
induce|16404004
_ asthma,|195967001
as
a history|392521001
of bronchiolitis|4120002
or
croup|71186008
in early childhood|264499004|68433009
is
a predictor
of asthma risk|195967001|30207005
in later life.|260383002|224130005

Studies|110465008|224699009
which
show
that upper respiratory tract infections|54150009
are
protective
against asthma|195967001
risk|30207005
also
tend
to
show
that lower respiratory tract infections conversely|50417007
tend
to
increase|260366006
the risk|30207005
of asthma.[51]|195967001

Antibiotic use|255631004|277889008|255631004|419385000
early in life|264499004|224130005
has
been
linked
to development|278923009
of asthma[52]|195967001
in several examples|261028005
;
it
is
thought|88952004
that antibiotics|255631004
make
children|410601007|160499008
who
are
predisposed
to atopic immune responses|115665000|35024006
susceptible|131196009
to development|278923009
of asthma|195967001
because
they
modify|243326001
gut flora,|122865005
and
thus
the immune system|116003000
(
as
described
by the hygiene hypothesis|284779002
).

The hygiene hypothesis|284779002
is
a hypothesis
about the cause|134198009
of asthma|195967001
and
other allergic disease,|74964007|64572001
and
is
supported|9096001|243114000
by epidemiologic data
for asthma.|195967001

All
of these things
may
negatively
affect|4065008
exposure|71677004|24932003
to beneficial bacteria|409822003
and
other immune system modulators|74964007|116003000
that
are
important
during development,|278923009
and
thus
may
cause|23981006|134198009
an increased risk|35105006|30207005|260366006|30207005
for asthma|195967001
and
allergy.|408439002|421961002

Delivery|236973005|118215003
via caesarean sections|11466000
is
associated|47429007
with an increased risk|35105006|30207005|260366006|30207005
of asthma.|195967001

The increased risk|35105006|30207005|260366006|30207005
has
been
estimated|414135002
at
between 20-80%
and
has
been
attributed|246061005
to the lack|41277001
of healthy bacterial colonization|263775005|409822003
which
results|394617004
from passage|255592004
through the birth canal.[56]|8389004

Over 100 genes|67271001

However,
such studies|110465008|224699009
must
be
repeated|27582007
to
ensure
the findings|404684003
are
not
due to chance.

Through the end|261782000|422117008
of 2005,
25 genes|67271001
had
been
associated|47429007
with asthma|195967001
in six|422218008
or
more separate populations|242762006|263869007|385436007
:
[57]

Many
of these genes|67271001
are
related|272151006|262094002
to the immune system|116003000
or
to modulating inflammation.|261019009|257552002

However,
even
among this list
of highly replicated genes|75540009|1305003|67271001
associated|47429007
with asthma,|195967001
the results|394617004
have
not
been
consistent|385433004
among all
of the populations|385436007
that
have
been
tested.|272393004

This
indicates|410535002
that
these genes|67271001
are
not
associated|47429007
with asthma|195967001
under every condition,|260905004
and
that researchers
need|410525008|103325001
to do further investigation to|46053002|386053000
figure
out
the complex interactions|103360007
that
cause|23981006|134198009
asthma.|195967001

One theory|421379005
is
that asthma|195967001
is
a collection
of several diseases,|261028005|64572001
and
that genes|67271001
might
have
a role
in only|50607009|420295001
subsets
of asthma._[citation|195967001

Some genetic variants|3950001|40885006|255395001|40885006
may
only
cause|23981006|134198009
asthma|195967001
when
they
are
combined|89780004

The genetic trait,|3950001|255395001
CD14 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) C-159T|125681006|71211001|50334000|50607009|71211001|50334000
and
exposure|71677004|24932003
to endotoxin|18127008
(
a bacterial product|111117008

are
a well-replicated example|20572008|1305003
of a gene-environment interaction|67271001|276339004
that
is
associated|47429007
with asthma.|195967001

Endotoxin exposure|18127008|71677004|18127008|24932003
varies
from person|125676002
to person|125676002
and
can
come
from several environmental sources,|261028005|276339004|260753009

environmental tobacco smoke,|276339004|102407002

Studying|110465008|224699009
the prevalence
of asthma|195967001
and
related diseases|272151006|64572001|262094002|64572001
such as eczema|281104002
and
hay fever|444316004
have
yielded important clues
about some key risk factors.|80943009

The strongest risk factor|260404005|80943009
for developing asthma|195967001
is
a history|392521001
of atopic disease|115665000
;[32]
this increases one's risk|260366006|421379005|30207005
of hay fever|444316004
by
up to 5 fold|264706000|26310004|264605009|26310004
and
the risk|30207005
of asthma|195967001
by 3?4 fold.[61]|260279004|26310004

There
is
a strong correlation|260404005
between obesity|414915002
and
the risk|30207005
of asthma|195967001
with
both
increasing|260369004
in recent years.|6493001|258707000

Several factors|261028005
associated|47429007
with obesity|414915002
may
play|300776002
a role
in the pathogenesis|303109001
of asthma,|195967001
including|55919000
decreased respiratory function|80954004
due to a buildup
of adipose tissue|38888009
(fat|271590003
)
and
the fact
that adipose tissue|38888009
leads|88488004|236874000
to a pro-inflammatory state,|52541003|398070004
which
has
been
associated|47429007
with non-eosinophilic asthma.[64]|367542003|233691007

Asthma|195967001
has
been
associated|47429007
with Churg?
Strauss syndrome,
and
individuals|125676002|385435006
with immunologically mediated urticaria|73510009|126485001

and
asthma.[65]|195967001|264695004

Some individuals|125676002|385435006
will
have
stable asthma|58158008|195967001
for weeks|258705008
or
months|258706009
and
then suddenly
develop
an episode|272128006

react
differently
to various factors.|256220008

However,
most individuals|125676002|385435006
can
develop
severe exacerbation|24484000
of asthma|195967001
from several triggering agents.[66][67]|261028005|260872001|261028005|410658008|260872001

Home factors|261770009
that
can
lead|88488004
to exacerbation
include|55919000
dust,|33008008
house mites,|261770009|84073006|257630004|84073006

a common cause|72906007|134198009
of acute attacks|272118002|216299002
in females|248152002
and

Both
virus|49872002

Although
there
is
currently|15240007
not
a precise physiologic, immunologic,|1360005|37523008
or
histologic test
for diagnosing asthma,|439401001|195967001
there
is
broad consensus|90522003
that physicians|309343006
should
use|277889008|419385000
spirometry|127783003
whenever

the diagnosis|439401001
and
management|413454004|119270007
of asthma.|195967001

The diagnosis|439401001
is
made
based|418836005
on the pattern|272135003
of symptoms
(airways obstruction|79688008

hyperresponsiveness
)
and
the response
to therapy|276239002

Asthma|195967001
is
defined
by the Global Initiative|60132005|247756008
for Asthma|195967001
as "
a chronic inflammatory disorder|128294001
of the airways|43725001|89187006
in which many cells|260396001|4421005
and
cellular elements|4421005|57795002
play|300776002
a role.

The chronic inflammation|84499006
is
associated|47429007
with airway hyperresponsiveness|43725001|89187006
that
leads|88488004|236874000
to recurrent episodes|263853000
of wheezing,|56018004
breathlessness,|267036007
chest tightness|23924001
and
coughing particularly|272039006
at night|2546009
or
in the early morning.|264499004|73775008

These episodes|272128006
are
usually
associated|47429007
with widespread,|85333001
but
variable airflow obstruction|255372005|4601000|26036001
within the lung|39607008|181216001
that
is
often reversible|70232002|35174006
either
spontaneously
or
with treatment".[70]|276239002|416118004

Asthma|195967001
is
clinically
classified|73504009
according to the frequency|260864003|272123002
of symptoms,
forced expiratory volume|165041004
in 1 second|260305007|81170007|260305007|257997001|260305007|288495006
(FEV1,
andpeak expiratory flow rate.|58322009

Asthma|195967001
may
also
be
classified|73504009
as atopic|115665000
(extrinsic|261074009|255400000

or
non-atopic|115665000
(intrinsic|260521003|255406006

,
based|418836005
on
whether symptoms
are
precipitated
by allergens|90260006

or
not
(non-atopic|115665000

While
asthma|195967001
is
classified|73504009
based|418836005
on severity,|272141005
at the moment there
is
no clear method|263707001|260686004|263707001|272394005

subgroups
that
respond
well|20572008
to different types|263735002|261664005

a current critical goal|15240007|410518001
of asthma research.[71]|195967001|264699005

Although
asthma|195967001
is
a chronic obstructive condition,|90734009|263821009|260905004
it
is
not
considered
as a part|260726005
of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease|413846005
as this term refers specifically|439980006
to combinations|228166004
of disease|64572001
that
are
irreversible
such as bronchiectasis,|12295008
chronic bronchitis,|63480004
and
emphysema.|49158009|87433001

Unlike these diseases,|64572001
the airway obstruction|79688008
in asthma|195967001
is
usually reversible|35174006
;
however,
if
left untreated,|7771000|25265005
the chronic inflammation|84499006
from asthma|195967001
can
lead|88488004
the lungs to|39607008
become
irreversibly
obstructed|263821009
due to airway remodeling.|43725001|89187006

In contrast
to emphysema,|49158009|87433001
asthma|195967001
affects|4065008
the bronchi,|955009
not
the alveoli.[73]

Brittle asthma|225057002

by recurrent, severe attacks.|255227004|24484000|216299002

Type 1 brittle asthma|258191002|225057002

[76]
some people|125676002
present|52101004|246105001
primarily
with coughing,|272039006

common|72906007
among top athletes.|421812003

One survey|421379005
of participants
in the 1996 Summer Olympic Games,
in Atlanta,
Georgia,|278873008|223375006
U.S.,|223688001
showed
that 15%
had
been
diagnosed|439401001
with asthma,|195967001
and
that 10%
were
on asthma medication.[81]|195967001|410942007

There
appears
to
be
a relatively high incidence|75540009|371879000
of asthma|195967001
in sports|415577004
such as cycling,
mountain biking,|257644005|70224005
and
long-distance running,|255511005|246132006|418060005
and
a relatively lower incidence|261122009
in weightlifting
and
diving.|63498000

It
is
unclear
how
much
of these disparities
are
from the effects|253861007
of training|118629009
in the sport.[81][82]|415577004

Exercise-induced asthma|31387002
can
be
treated|28995006
with the use|277889008|419385000
of a short-acting beta2 agonist.[31]|359530003|102498003|264664006|367450005|102498003|264664006

Asthma|195967001

of occupational asthma|57607007
are
not
reported|229059009|223458004

are
not
recognized
as such.

Estimates|414135002
by the American Thoracic Society
(2004

suggest
that 15?23%|264657009
of new-onset asthma cases|7147002|77374008|195967001|398241000|7147002|77374008|195967001|413769002

Most cases|398241000|413769002

The British Thoracic Society
determines
a diagnosis|439401001
of asthma|195967001
using|260676000
a ?response
to therapy? approach.|276239002

If
the patient|116154003
responds
to treatment,|276239002|416118004
then
this
is
considered to
be
a confirmation|74996004
of the diagnosis|439401001
of asthma.|195967001

The response
measured|258104002
is
the reversibility|263508009
of airway obstruction|79688008
after treatment.|276239002|416118004

Airflow|4601000
in the airways|43725001|89187006
is
measured|258104002
with a peak flow meter|334990001
or
spirometer,|303501006
and
the following diagnostic criteria|255260001|439401001|255260001|261004008
are
used|394850002
by the British Thoracic Society

[85]

In contrast,
the
US National Asthma Education and Prevention Program (NAEPP)|401135008|169443000
uses|277889008|394850002|260676000|419385000
a "symptom patterns" approach.|162492005

Their guidelines
for the diagnosis|439401001
and
management|413454004|119270007
of asthma|195967001
state|398070004
that
a diagnosis|439401001
of asthma|195967001
begins|255395001
by assessing
if
any
of the following list|255260001
of indicators
is
present.|52101004|246105001

While
the indicators
are
not sufficient to|51117008
support|9096001|243114000
a diagnosis|439401001
of asthma,|195967001
the presence|386397008
of multiple key indicators|260396001
increases|260366006
the probability|2931005
of a diagnosis|439401001
of asthma.|195967001

Spirometry|127783003
is
needed to|410525008|103325001
establish|263748003
a diagnosis|439401001
of asthma.[86]|195967001

The latest guidelines|260383002
from the U.S.|223688001

National Asthma Education and Prevention Program (NAEPP)|401135008|169443000
recommend
spirometry|127783003
at the time|410669006
of initial diagnosis,|884001|439401001|884001|232714002|439401001|232714002
after
treatment|276239002|416118004
is
initiated
and
symptoms
are
stabilized|409051000
,
whenever
control|31509003
of symptoms
deteriorates
,
and
every 1|260305007
or
2 years|260306008|258707000
on a regular basis.|17854005|17854005|418836005

The NAEPP guidelines
do
not
recommend
testing|272393004
peak expiratory flow|255587001|58322009
as a regular screening method|17854005
because
it
is
more variable|242762006|255372005
than spirometry.|127783003

However,
testing|272393004
peak flow|255587001
at rest|258157001
(
or
baseline
)
and
after exercise|61686008
can
be
helpful, especially
in young patients|84422007|116154003
who
may
experience
only exercise-induced asthma.|50607009|31387002|420295001|31387002

It
may
also
be
useful
for daily|69620002
self-monitoring|310858007
and
for checking|360160009
the effects|253861007
of new medications.|7147002|410942007

Peak flow readings|255587001|50360004
can
be
charted
together with a record
of symptoms
or
use|277889008|419385000
peak flow charting software.|255587001

This
allows
patients to|116154003
track|257719005
their peak flow readings|255587001|50360004
and
pass
information
back
to their doctor|309343006
or
respiratory therapist.[89]|442867008

Other conditions|74964007|260905004
may
cause|23981006|134198009
symptoms
similar
to those
of asthma|195967001
and
a physician|309343006
would
conduct|844005
differential diagnoses to|47965005
determine
if
any
of the following|255260001
could
be
causes|134198009
of symptoms
:
[86]

Before
diagnosing asthma,|439401001|195967001
alternative possibilities
should
be
considered
such as the use|277889008|419385000
of known bronchoconstrictors|36692007
(substances|105590001
that
cause|23981006|134198009
narrowing|25659002|134223000
of the airways,|43725001|89187006
e.g.|258795003

certain anti-inflammatory agents|17162000|330901000
or
beta-blockers.|373254001

Among elderly people,|105436006|125676002
the presenting symptom|246105001
may
be
fatigue,|84229001
cough,|272039006
or
difficulty breathing,|267036007
all
of which
may
be
erroneously
attributed|246061005
to Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease|413846005
(COPD|413846005
)
,
congestive heart failure,|42343007
or
simple aging.[90]|13673007|248280005|264705001|13673007|248280005|264703008

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease|413846005
can
coexist
with asthma|195967001
and
can
occur|272120004
as a complication|116223007|263718001
of chronic asthma.|90734009|195967001

After the age|424144002
of 65 most people|264695004|125676002
with obstructive airway disease|263821009|43725001|64572001|263821009|89187006|64572001
will
have
asthma|195967001
and
COPD.|413846005

In this setting,
COPD|413846005
can
be
differentiated|263933003
by increased airway neutrophils,|35105006|43725001|116712007|35105006|89187006|116712007|260366006|43725001|116712007|260366006|89187006|116712007
abnormally increased wall thickness,|263899003|224727009
and
increased smooth muscle|35105006|122447002|260366006|122447002
in the bronchi.|955009

However,
this level|258395000|276625007
of investigation|386053000
is
not
performed|398166005
due to COPD|413846005
and
asthma|195967001
sharing
similar principles
of management|413454004|119270007
:
corticosteroids,|79440004
long acting beta agonists,|255511005|52095000|102498003|255511005|260989008|102498003
and
smoking cessation.

It closely
resembles
asthma|195967001
in symptoms,

correlated
with more exposure|242762006|71677004|242762006|24932003

(
as
measured|258104002

or
indirect|255541007
(
due to acid reflux|235595009

can
show

However,
with aspiration,|14910006|278847003|129316008|68052005

can
be
diagnosed|439401001

for asthma|195967001
is
identifying triggers,|7882003
such as cigarette smoke,|102408007
pets,
or
aspirin,|387458008
and
eliminating exposure|71677004|24932003
to them.

If trigger avoidance|410658008
is
insufficient,|71978007|423437008
the use|277889008|419385000
of medication|410942007
is
recommended.

Pharmaceutical drugs|80288002
are
selected
based|418836005
on,
among other things,|74964007
the severity|272141005

acting
and
long-acting categories.[97][98]|255511005|260309001|255511005|264708004

Bronchodilators|372580007
are
recommended
for short-term relief|224978009

Previous analysis|9130008|272389005
of data
from 2001
to 2007
had
suggested
the prevalence
of asthma|195967001
was
stable.[144]|58158008

Asthma prevalence|195967001
in the
US
is
higher|75540009|371879000
than
in most other countries|74964007|223369002
in the world,
but
varies
drastically
between diverse
US populations.|385436007

In the
US,
asthma prevalence|195967001
is
highest|75540009|371879000
in Puerto Ricans,
African Americans,|15086000
Filipinos,|76768002
Irish Americans,
and
Native Hawaiians,|20140003
and
lowest|62482003|261122009|371880002
in Mexicans
and
Koreans.|38361009

Mortality rates|409651001
follow|367409002|421939007
similar trends,|30294006
and
response
to salbutamol|372897005
is
lower|261122009
in Puerto Ricans
than
in African Americans|15086000
or
Mexicans.

As
with worldwide asthma disparities,|195967001
differences|263735002
in asthma prevalence,|195967001
mortality,|409651001
and
drug response|410942007
in the
US
may
be
explained
by differences|263735002
in genetic, social|3950001|255395001
and
environmental risk factors.|102487004

Asthma prevalence also|195967001
differs
between populations|385436007
of the same ethnicity|262126009|397731000
who
are
born|106970005|81827009|398209006
and
live|419749002
in different places.|263735002|257557008

US-born Mexican populations,|385436007
for example,
have
higher asthma rates|75540009|195967001|371879000|195967001
than non-
US born Mexican populations|385436007
that
are
living|224130005|419749002
in the
US.[151]

There
is
no correlation
between asthma|195967001
and
gender|263495000
in children.|410601007|160499008

More adult women|242762006|133936004|224526002
are
diagnosed|439401001
with asthma|195967001
than adult men,|133936004|339947000
but
this
does
not necessarily
mean|255586005
that more adult women|242762006|133936004|224526002
have
asthma.[152]|195967001

Asthma|195967001
was
recognized
in Ancient Egypt|223511009
and
was
treated|28995006
by drinking|160573003|30953006
an incense mixture|272163001
known|36692007
as kyphi[153] Officially
recognized
as a specific respiratory problem|69658003|258162000|55607006|69658003|449071006|55607006
separate|263869007
from others|74964007
was
first|255216001|232714002
recognized
and
named|27468005
by Hippocrates circa 450 BC.

During the 1930s?50s,
asthma|195967001
was
considered
as
being
one|421379005
of the 'holy seven' psychosomatic illnesses.|420359007|37057007

Its aetiology|134198009
was
considered
to
be
psychological,|60224009
with treatment often|276239002|70232002|416118004|70232002
based|418836005
on psychoanalysis|61436009
and
other 'talking cures'.|74964007|74964007|87335007

As these psychoanalysts|224600003
interpreted|363714003
the asthmatic wheeze|195967001|56018004
as the suppressed cry|245780008|28263002
of the child|410601007|160499008
for its mother,|72705000
they
considered
that
the treatment|276239002|416118004
of depression|35489007|366979004|255339005
was
especially important
for individuals|125676002|385435006
with asthma.|195967001

Among the first papers|255216001|50833004|232714002|50833004
in modern medicine|410942007
published
on the subject
are
one|421379005
published
in 1873,
which
tried
to
explain
the pathophysiology|386585008
of the disease [155]|64572001
and
one|421379005
in 1872,
which
concluded
that asthma|195967001
can
be
cured
by rubbing
the chest|261179002
with chloroform liniment.[156]|424273005|63316001

Some
of the first references|255216001|232714002
to medical treatment|74188005|276239002|74188005|416118004
include|55919000
one|421379005
in 1880,
when
Dr.|309343006

J.

B.

Berkart used IV therapy|394850002|276239002
to administer doses|418283001|277406006
of a drug|410942007
called
pilocarpin.

In 1886,
F.H.|372639009|89177007|372639009|258322007|372639009|286551008

Bosworth
theorized
a connection|263538003
between asthma|195967001
and
hay fever.|444316004

Epinephrine|387362001
was
first|255216001|232714002
referred to|439980006
in the treatment|276239002|416118004
of asthma|195967001
in 1905,
[159]
and
again
for acute asthma|304527002
in 1910.[160]
