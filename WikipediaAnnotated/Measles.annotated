or
English measles|297487008|14189004|25804004|14189004
)
,
is
an infection
of the respiratory system|20139000|278197002
caused|23981006|134198009
by a virus,|49872002
specifically
a paramyxovirus
of the genus _Morbillivirus_.|83313003

Morbilliviruses,|83313003
like other paramyxoviruses,|74964007
are
enveloped

Koplik's spots|271667004
seen
inside the mouth|74262004|123851003|21082005|181220002
are
pathognomonic
(diagnostic|439401001|261004008
)
for measles,|14189004
but
are
not often|70232002
seen,
even
in real cases|398241000|413769002
of measles,|14189004

they
are
transient|14803004
and
may
disappear
within a day|258703001|259032004
of arising.|68727004

The characteristic measles rash|247470007
is
classically
described
as a generalized, maculopapular, erythematous rash|60132005|247471006|444827008
that
begins|255395001
several days|261028005|258703001
after the fever starts.|386661006|255395001

It
starts|255395001|385652002
on the back of ears|255551008|117590005|255551008|1910005
and
,
after
a few hours,|57176003|258702006
spreads|410677005
to the head|69536005|302548004
and
neck|45048000|302550007
before
spreading|410677005
to
cover|255334000
most
of the body,|279495008|123037004
often causing itching.|70232002|23981006|424492005

The rash|271807003
is
said|66049007
to "

to dark brown,|255419005|371254008
before
disappearing._[citation

The measles rash|247470007
appears
two|420797005
to four days|421534005|258703001
after the initial symptoms|884001|232714002
and
lasts
for
up to eight days.[3]|421825006|258703001

Complications|116223007
with measles|14189004
are
relatively common,|72906007
ranging
from the relatively mild|255604002
and
less serious ones|276139006|42745003|421379005|263796003|42745003|421379005
like diarrhea|398032003
to more serious ones|242762006|42745003|421379005
such as pneumonia,|205237003
otitis media,|65363002
acute encephalitis|272118002|45170000
(rarely SSPE|103356009|416154000
--
subacute sclerosing panencephalitis,|416154000
and
corneal ulceration|91514001
(
leading|236874000
to corneal scarring.|95726001

Complications|116223007
are
usually more severe|24484000
in adults|133936004
who
catch|30623001
the virus.|49872002

Between the years 1987|258707000
and
2000,
the case fatality rate|409653003
across the United States|223688001
was
three measles-attributable deaths|421291004|14189004|419620001|421291004|14189004|268923008
per 1000 cases,|398241000|413769002
or
0.3%.

In underdeveloped nations
with high rates|75540009|371879000
of malnutrition|248325000
and
poor healthcare,|11403006|255351007
fatality rates|399166001
have
been
as high|75540009|371879000
as 28%.

In immunocompromised patients|370391006
(e.g.|258795003

people|125676002
with AIDS|62479008
the fatality rate|399166001
is
approximately 30%.[5]|26175008

Measles|14189004
is
caused|23981006|134198009
by the measles virus,|52584002
a single-stranded, negative-sense|125681006|260385009|106148006|50607009|260385009|106148006
enveloped
RNA virus|11705000
of the genus Morbillivirus|83313003
within the family _Paramyxoviridae_.|128354001

Humans|278412004
are
the natural hosts|510009
of the virus|49872002
;
no animal reservoirs|387961004|257687008
are
known|36692007
to
exist.

This highly contagious virus|75540009|49872002|75540009
is
spread|410677005
by coughing|272039006
and
sneezing|162367006
via close personal contact|29179001|11723008|29179001|70862002
or
direct contact|255589003|11723008|255589003|70862002
with secretions.|46242002

Risk factors|80943009
for measles virus infection|52584002|14189004|34014006
include|55919000
the following|255260001
:

Infants|418119000
who
lose
passive antibody|68498002|112133008
before the age|424144002
of routine immunization|50811001|127785005|50811001

Risk factors|80943009
for severe measles|24484000|14189004
and
its complications|116223007
include|55919000
the following|255260001
:

Clinical diagnosis|39154008
of measles|14189004
requires
a history|392521001
of fever|386661006
of
at least three days,|276139006|421291004|258703001|263796003|421291004|258703001
with
at least
one|421379005
of the three C's|421291004
(cough,|272039006
coryza,|82272006
conjunctivitis|9826008
).

Observation|103705002
of Koplik's spots|271667004
is
also diagnostic|439401001|261004008
of measles.|14189004

Alternatively,
laboratory diagnosis|46159000
of measles|14189004
can
be
done
with confirmation|74996004
of positive measles IgM antibodies|258758003|120969007|10828004|120969007
or
isolation|40174006|46651001
of measles virus RNA|117277004
from respiratory specimens.|258162000|123038009|449071006|123038009

In patients|116154003
where phlebotomy|396540005|367425007
is
not possible, saliva|371930009|256897009|60022001|256897009
can
be
collected
for salivary measles-specific IgA testing.|263864002|14189004|69658003|263864002|14189004|69658003|272393004

Positive contact|258758003|11723008|258758003|70862002|10828004|11723008|10828004|70862002
with other patients|74964007|116154003
known|36692007
to
have
measles|14189004
adds
strong epidemiological evidence|260404005|18669006
to the diagnosis.|439401001

The contact|11723008|70862002
with any infected person|125676002
in any way,
including|55919000
semen|264337003|6993007
through sex,|258139002|365952006|263495000|70256003|57312000
saliva,|256897009
or
mucus,|49909006
can
cause|23981006|134198009
infection.

In developed countries,|223369002
most children|410601007|160499008
are
immunized
against measles|14189004
by the age|424144002
of 18 months,|258706009
generally
as
part|260726005
of a three-part MMR vaccine|421291004|260726005|396429000
(measles,|14189004
mumps,|240526004
and
rubella.|36653000

The vaccination
is
generally
not
given|419582001
earlier|264499004
than this because children|410601007|160499008
younger|84422007
than 18 months usually|258706009
retain|397909002
antimeasles immunoglobulins|112133008|42441008
(antibodies|68498002
)
transmitted|60117003|258150004
from the mother|72705000
during pregnancy.|289908002

A second dose|81170007|277406006|81170007|408102007|257997001|277406006|257997001|408102007|288495006|277406006|288495006|408102007
is
usually
given|419582001
to children|410601007|160499008
between the ages|424144002
of four|421534005
and
five,|421820001
to
increase|260366006
rates
of immunity.|58915005

Vaccination rates
have
been
high enough to|75540009|371879000
make
measles|14189004
relatively uncommon|103356009
.

Even
a single case|125681006|398241000|50607009|398241000
in a college|224864007
dormitory
or
similar setting
is
often|70232002
met|229057006
with a local vaccination program,|255470001
in case|398241000
any
of the people|125676002
exposed|24932003
are
not already immune.|255386009

In developing countries|223369002
where measles|14189004
is
highly endemic,|75540009
WHO doctors|309343006
recommend
two doses|420797005|277406006
of vaccine|398827000
be
given|419582001
at six|422218008
and
nine months|422113007|258706009
of age.|424144002

The vaccine|398827000
should
be
given|419582001
whether
the child|410601007|160499008
is
HIV-infected|19030005|86406008|402916007
or
not.

The vaccine|398827000
is
less effective|276139006|255403003|276139006|254648000|263796003|255403003|263796003|254648000
in HIV-infected infants,|19030005|418119000|86406008|418119000|402916007|418119000
but
the risk|30207005
of adverse reactions|281647001
is
low.|62482003|371880002

Measles vaccination programs|47435007
are
often|70232002
used to|394850002
deliver
other child health interventions,|74964007|268481000|225334002
as well,|20572008
such as bed nets to|229772003|255442003
protect
against malaria,|248437004
antiparasite medicine|410942007
and
vitamin A supplements,|82622003|373453009|373453009
and
so|223528007
contribute
to the reduction|58294000|260400001|289928003
of child deaths|105444006
from other causes.[9]|74964007|134198009

Unvaccinated populations|385436007
are
at risk|410519009
for the disease.|64572001

Traditionally low vaccination rates|62482003|371880002
in northern Nigeria|223565009
dropped|426684005|404218003
further|46053002
in the early 2000s|264499004
when
radical preachers|32948009|255612005
promoted
a rumor
that polio vaccines|415129008
were
a Western
plot
to
sterilize
Muslims|309884000
and
infect
them
with HIV.|19030005|86406008|402916007

The number|410680006|410681005
of cases|398241000|413769002
of measles|14189004
rose
significantly,
and
hundreds
of children|410601007|160499008
died.|419620001|419099009

This
could
also
have
had
to do
with the aforementioned other health-promoting measures often|263775005|246445000|70232002|263775005|367346004|70232002
given|419582001
with the vaccine.|398827000

Claims
of a connection|263538003
between the MMR vaccine|396429000
and
autism|408856003
were
raised|260399008
in a 1998 paper|50833004
in _
The Lancet_,|350810002
a respected British medical journal.|74188005|433497004

Later investigation|260383002|386053000
by _Sunday Times_ journalist Brian Deer|307146003|410669006|308004006|107003000|307146003|417929005|308004006|107003000
discovered
the lead author|88488004|308004006
of the article,
Andrew Wakefield,
had
multiple undeclared conflicts of interest,|260396001|15863006|225469004
[12]
and
had
broken other ethical codes.

The _Lancet_ paper|350810002|50833004
was
later
retracted,|37794007
and
Wakefield
was
found|404684003
guilty|7571003
by the General Medical Council|60132005|74188005
of serious professional misconduct|42745003
in May 2010,
and
was
struck|89098005
off the Medical Register,|74188005|229053005
meaning|255586005
he
could
no longer practise|255511005
as a doctor|309343006
in the UK.

The GMC's panel also considered two|261586004|420797005
of Wakefield's colleagues
:
John Walker-Smith|49338004|308323009
was
also found guilty|404684003|7571003|7571003
and
struck|89098005
off the Register|229053005
;
Simon Murch "|262144001
was
in error"
but
acted
in good faith,|20572008
and
was
cleared.|84989007

Walker-Smith|49338004|308323009
was
later
cleared|84989007
and
reinstated
after winning
an appeal
;
the appeal court's finding|404684003
was
based|418836005
on the panel's conduct|261586004|844005
of the case,|398241000
and
gave|419582001
no support|9096001|243114000
to the MMR-autism hypothesis,|408856003
which
the official judgement|61254005
described
as lacking support|41277001|9096001|41277001|243114000
from any respectable body|279495008|123037004
of opinion.

The research
was
declared
fraudulent
in 2011
by the _BMJ_.

Scientific evidence|18669006
provides
no support|9096001|243114000
for the hypothesis
that MMR
plays|300776002
a role
in causing autism.[17]|23981006|408856003

The autism-related MMR study|408856003|272151006|110465008|408856003|272151006|224699009|408856003|262094002|110465008|408856003|262094002|224699009
in Britain
caused|23981006|134198009
use|277889008|419385000
of the vaccine|398827000
to plunge,
and
measles cases|14189004|398241000|14189004|413769002
came
back
:
2007 saw 971 cases|398241000|413769002
in England|223664003
and
Wales,|223683005
the biggest rise|255509001|263768009
in occurrence|272120004
in measles cases|14189004|398241000|14189004|413769002
since
records
began|255395001
in 1995.

A 2005 measles outbreak|14189004|443684005
in Indiana|224059007
was
attributed|246061005
to children|410601007|160499008
whose parents|40683002
refused|443390004
vaccination.[19]

There
is
no specific treatment|69658003|276239002|69658003|416118004
for measles.|14189004

Most patients|116154003
with uncomplicated measles|263914008|14189004
will
recover|74822006
with rest|258157001
and
supportive treatment.|276239002|416118004

It
is
,
however,
important to
seek
medical advice|74188005|420227002
if
the patient|116154003
becomes
more unwell,|242762006
as
they
may
be
developing complications.|116223007

Some patients|116154003
will
develop
pneumonia|205237003
as a sequelae|302049001
to the measles.|14189004

Other complications|116223007
include|55919000
ear infections,|129127001
bronchitis,|32398004
and
encephalitis.|45170000

Acute measles encephalitis|272118002|14189004|45170000
has
a mortality rate|409651001
of 15%.

While
there
is
no specific treatment|69658003|276239002|69658003|416118004
for measles encephalitis,|14189004|45170000
antibiotics|255631004
are
required
for bacterial pneumonia,|53084003
sinusitis,|36971009
and
bronchitis|32398004
that
can
follow|367409002|421939007
measles.|14189004

All other treatment|74964007|276239002|74964007|416118004
addresses|397635003
symptoms,
with ibuprofen,|387207008
or
acetaminophen|387517004
(paracetamol|387517004
)
to
reduce|260400001
fever|386661006
and
pain|22253000
and
,
if
required
,
a fast-acting bronchodilator|16985007|372580007|277748003|372580007
for cough.|272039006

As for aspirin,|387458008
some research
has
suggested
a correlation
between children|410601007|160499008
who
take|419652001
aspirin|387458008
and
the development|278923009
of Reye's syndrome.|74351001

Some research
has
shown
aspirin|387458008
may
not
be
the only medication|50607009|410942007|420295001|410942007
associated|47429007
with Reye's, and even antiemetics have been implicated,[21] with the point being the link between aspirin use in children and Reye's syndrome development is weak at best,
and
even antiemetics|372764000
have
been
implicated
,
[21]
with the point
being
the link
between aspirin use|387458008|277889008|387458008|419385000
in children|410601007|160499008
and
Reye's, and even antiemetics have been implicated,[21] with the point being the link between aspirin use in children and Reye's syndrome development|74351001|278923009
is
weak|13791008|260407003
,[21] with the point being the link between aspirin use in children and Reye's syndrome development is weak at best
if
not actually nonexistent.

Nevertheless,
most health authorities still|394747008
caution
against the use|277889008|419385000
of aspirin|387458008
for any fevers|386661006
in children|410601007|160499008
under 16.[23][24][25][26]|264657009

The use|277889008|419385000
of vitamin A|82622003
in treatment|52101004|276239002|52101004|416118004|18720000|276239002|18720000|416118004
has
been
investigated.|116698004

A systematic review|415300000
of trials|110465008
into its use|277889008|419385000
found|404684003
no significant reduction|386134007|58294000|386134007|260400001|386134007|289928003
in overall mortality,|409651001
but
it
did
reduce|260400001
mortality|409651001
in children|410601007|160499008
aged|424144002|105436006
under two years.[27][28][29]|420797005|258707000

While
the vast majority
of patients|116154003
survive
measles,|14189004
complications|116223007
occur|272120004
fairly frequently,|70232002
and
may
include|55919000
bronchitis,|32398004
and
panencephalitis
which
is
potentially fatal.|399166001

Also,
even
if
the patient|116154003
is
not
concerned
about death|419620001|268923008
or
sequela|302049001
from the measles,|14189004
the person|125676002
may
spread|410677005
the disease|64572001
to an immunocompromised patient,|370391006
for whom
the risk|30207005
of death|419620001|268923008
is
much higher,|242762006|75540009|242762006|371879000|4757001|75540009|4757001|371879000
due to complications|116223007
such as giant cell pneumonia.|192658007

Acute measles encephalitis|272118002|14189004|45170000
is
another serious risk|42745003|30207005
of measles virus infection.|52584002|14189004|34014006

It typically
occurs|272120004
two days|420797005|258703001
to one week|421379005|258705008|421379005|259038000
after the breakout
of the measles|14189004
exanthem|271807003
,
and
begins|255395001
with very high fever,|260360000|386661006
severe headache,|24484000|25064002
convulsions,
and
altered mentation.

Patient|116154003
may
become
comatose,|371632003
and
death|419620001|268923008
or
brain injury|2470005
may
occur.[30]|272120004

In 2000
the WHO
estimated|414135002
that there
were
~45 million cases|398241000|413769002
of measles worldwide|14189004
with 800,000 deaths|419620001|268923008
from it.

Mortality|409651001
in developed countries|223369002
is
~1/1000.|260305007

In sub-Saharan Africa,|409988000
mortality|409651001
is
10%.

In cases|398241000|413769002
with complications,|116223007
the rate
may
rise
to 20?30%.

In 2010,
approximately 380 deaths|26175008|419620001|26175008|268923008
occurred|272120004
every day|69620002
from measles.[31]|14189004|264664006

Even
in countries|223369002
where vaccination
has
been
introduced|127487003
,
rates
may
remain
high.|75540009|371879000

In Ireland,|223676003
vaccination
was
introduced|127487003
in 1985.

The number|410680006|410681005
of cases|398241000|413769002
was
99,903
in
that year.|258707000|259039008

Within two years,|420797005|258707000
the number|410680006|410681005
of cases|398241000|413769002
had
fallen|1912002
to 201,
but
this fall|1912002
was
not
sustained|263892007
:
case numbers|398241000|410680006|398241000|410681005
in 1989,
1993
and
2000
were
1,248,|260305007
4,328|260308009
and
1,603,|260305007
respectively.

This country's example|223369002
illustrates
the need|410525008|103325001
for vaccination rates
greater|263768009
than 95% to
prevent
the
spread|410677005
of measles.|14189004

According to the
WHO,
measles|14189004
is
a leading cause|236874000|134198009
of vaccine-preventable childhood mortality.|398827000|68433009|409651001

Worldwide,
the fatality rate|399166001
has
been
significantly
reduced|260400001
by a vaccination campaign
led|88488004|236874000
by partners|262043009
in the Measles Initiative|14189004|247756008
:
the American Red Cross,|386713009|65145006|371240000|65145006
the United States Centers for Disease Control|223688001|26216008|64572001|31509003
and
Prevention|169443000
(CDC
)
,
the United Nations Foundation,|418836005

and
the WHO.

Globally,
measles|14189004
fell|1912002
60%
from an estimated 873,000 deaths|414135002|419620001|414135002|268923008
in 1999
to 345,000
in 2005.

Estimates|414135002
for 2008
indicate|410535002
deaths|419620001|268923008
fell|1912002
further|46053002
to 164,000 globally,
with 77%
of the remaining measles deaths|14189004|419620001|14189004|268923008
in 2008
occurring|272120004
within the Southeast Asian region.[32]|186044009|410673009

In 2006-07 there
were
12,132 cases|398241000|413769002
in 32 European countries|223633000
:
85%
occurred|272120004
in five countries|421820001|223369002
:
Germany,|223637004
Italy,|223668000
Romania Switzerland|223655008|223642007
and
the UK.

80%
occurred|272120004
in children|410601007|160499008
and
there
were
7 deaths.|419620001|268923008

Five|421820001
out of six|422218008
WHO regions|410673009
have
set goals to|410518001
eliminate
measles,|14189004
and
at the 63rd World Health Assembly|263775005
in May 2010,
delegates
agreed
a global target|60132005
of a 95% reduction|58294000|260400001|289928003
in measles mortality|14189004|409651001
by 2015
from the level|258395000|276625007
seen
in 2000,
as well as
to
move|302000008|384598002|370125004
towards eventual eradication.

However,
no specific global target date|69658003|60132005|410671006
for eradication
has
yet
been
agreed
to
as of May 2010.[33][34]|264667004

The measles virus|52584002
evolved|59381007
from the formerly widespread rinderpest virus,|85333001|73376006
which
infects
cattle.

Sequence analysis|72633008|272389005
has
suggested
that
the two viruses most probably|420797005|49872002
diverged
in the 11th
and
12th centuries,
though
the periods|259037005
as early|264499004
as the 5th century fall|32088001|1912002
within the 95% confidence interval|225487001|385673002
of these calculations.

Other analysis|74964007|272389005
has
suggested
that
the divergence|263741009
may
be
even older|70753007
because of the technique's tendency to|272394005
underestimate
ages|424144002
when
strong purifying selection|260404005|50606000
is
in action.|129264002

There
is
some linguistic evidence|18669006
for an earlier origin|264499004|255395001
within the seventh century.|86777004

The current epidemic strain|15240007|48532005|15240007|276768000
evolved|59381007
at the beginning|255395001
of the 20th century?most probably
between 1908
and
1943.[39]

The
WHO currently|15240007
recognises
8 clades
of measles|14189004
(A - H|89177007|258322007|286551008
).

Subtypes|260837004
are
designed
with numerals - A1,|421449004
D2 etc.

Currently|15240007
a total|258755000|255619001
of 23 subtypes|264657009|260837004
are
recognised.

The sequencing
of the 450 nucleotides|71211001
that
code
for the C?terminal 150 amino acids|42796001|52518006
of N|258310009
are
the minimum amount|255605001|107651007|255604002|107651007
of sequence data|72633008
required
for genotyping|363779003
a measles virus isolate.|52584002|46651001

The genotyping scheme|363779003
was
introduced|127487003
in 1998
and
extended|255536004|288467006|255590007
in 2002
and
2003.

The major genotypes|255603008
differ
between countries|223369002
and
restatus
of measles circulation|14189004|413854007
within
that country|223369002
or
region.|410673009

Indigenous transmission|258150004
of measles virus|52584002
was
interrupted|261017006
in the United States|223688001
and
Australia|223621005
by 2000
and
the Americas
by 2002.

The Antonine Plague,|58750007
165?180 AD,
also
known|36692007
as the Plague|58750007
of Galen,|34385009
who
described
it,
was
probably smallpox|67924001|243568000
or
measles.|14189004

The disease|64572001
killed|248007002
as many|260396001
as one-third|421379005|70905002
of the population|385436007|389109008
in some areas,|42798000
and
decimated
the Roman army.|223655008

Estimates|414135002
of the timing|246512002
of evolution
of measles|14189004
seem
to
suggest
this plague|58750007
was
something
other than measles.|14189004

The first scientific description|255216001|232714002
of measles|14189004
and
its distinction
from smallpox|67924001|243568000
and
chickenpox|38907003
is
credited
to the Persian physician,|309343006
Rhazes
(860?932
)
,
who
published
_
The Book|278212002
of Smallpox|67924001|243568000
and
Measles_.|14189004

Given|419582001
what
is
now
known|36692007
about the evolution
of measles,|14189004
this account
is
remarkably timely.

Measles|14189004
is
an endemic disease,|86820007
meaning|255586005
it
has
been
continually
present|52101004|246105001
in a community,|133928008
and
many people|260396001|125676002
develop
resistance.|30714006

In populations|385436007
not
exposed|24932003
to measles,|14189004
exposure|71677004|24932003
to a new disease|7147002|64572001
can
be
devastating.

In 1529,
a measles outbreak|14189004|443684005
in Cuba|223701004
killed|248007002
two-thirds|420797005|70905002
of the natives|263818007
who
had
previously survived smallpox.|67924001|243568000

Two years later,|420797005|258707000
measles|14189004
was
responsible|394851003
for the deaths|419620001|268923008
of half
the population|385436007|389109008
of Honduras,|223694009
and
had
ravaged
Mexico,|223687006
Central America,|26216008
and
the Inca civilization.[42]|55990000

In roughly
the last 150 years,|258707000
measles|14189004
has
been
estimated|414135002
to
have
killed|248007002
about 200 million people worldwide.|125676002

During the 1850s,
measles|14189004
killed|248007002
a fifth|32088001
of Hawaii's people.|224049006|125676002

In 1875,
measles|14189004

On 1 April 2009,|260305007
the disease broke out|64572001
in two schools|420797005|257698009
in North Wales.|223683005

Ysgol John

has
had
the measles vaccine.|396427003

Beginning|255395001
in April 2009 there
was
a large outbreak|255509001|443684005
of measles|14189004
in Bulgaria,|223648006
with over 24,000 cases|21481007|398241000|21481007|413769002
including|55919000
24 deaths.|419620001|268923008

From Bulgaria,|223648006
the strain|48532005|276768000
was
carried|288345009
to Germany,|223637004
Turkey,|278900006|20657003
Greece,|223651004
Macedonia,|439341006

other European countries.[61]|74964007|223633000

Since
the beginning|255395001
of September,
2009,
Johannesburg,
a city|284560003
in Gauteng,
South Africa|223549008
reported|229059009|223458004
about 48 cases|398241000|413769002
of measles.|14189004

Soon
after the outbreak,|443684005
the government
ordered
all children to|410601007|160499008
be
vaccinated.

Vaccination programs
were
then
initiated
in all schools,|257698009
and
parents|40683002
of young children|84422007|410601007|84422007|160499008
were
advised|424900004
to
have
them
vaccinated.

Many people|260396001|125676002
were
not willing to|225466006
have
the vaccination
done
,
as
it
is
believed to
be
unsafe
and
ineffective.

The Health Department|263775005
assured
the public
that
their program
was
indeed safe.

Speculation
arose|68727004
as to
whether
or
not new needles|7147002|79068005
were
being
used.|394850002

By mid-October,|255562008
there
were
at least 940 recorded cases,|276139006|398241000|276139006|413769002|263796003|398241000|263796003|413769002

As of May 2011,
over 17,000 cases|21481007|398241000|21481007|413769002
of measles|14189004
have
so far|223528007|46053002
been
reported|229059009|223458004
from France|223666001
between January 2008

further smaller outbreaks.|46053002|263796003|443684005|46053002|255507004|443684005

The French outbreak|19434008|443684005
has
been
specifically
linked
to a further outbreak|46053002|443684005
in Quebec|224022006
in 2011,
where 327 cases|398241000|413769002

the European outbreaks|414152003|443684005|443684005
in general|60132005
have
also
been
implicated
in further small outbreaks|46053002|255507004|443684005
in the USA,|223688001
where 40 separate importations|259031006|263869007

had
been
reported|229059009|223458004
between January 1

May 20.

Some experts
stated|398070004
that
the stubborn persistence|130965009
of the disease|64572001
in Europe|223502009
could
be
a stumbling block|82612009|26036001|82612009|112232007
to global eradication.|60132005

It
has
proven difficult to|277025001|52925006
vaccinate
a sufficient number|51117008|410680006|51117008|410681005
of children|410601007|160499008
in Europe to|223502009
eradicate
the disease,|64572001
because of opposition|247919005
on philosophical
or
religious grounds,|62458008
or
fears
of side-effects,
or
because
some minority groups|410599005|261586004|410599005|160481000|255606000|261586004|255606000|160481000
are
hard to|72505002
reach|282679008
,
or
simply
because
parents|40683002
forget
to
have
their children|410601007|160499008
vaccinated.

Vaccination
is
not mandatory
in Europe,|223502009
in contrast
to the United States|223688001
and
many Latin American countries,|260396001|223369002
