A
*
*disease|64572001
*
*
is
an abnormal condition|263654008|260905004
affecting|247591002|248448006
the body|279495008|123037004
of an organism.|410653004

It
is
often|70232002
construed to
be
a
*
*medical condition|74188005|260905004
*
*
associated|47429007
with specific symptoms|69658003
and
signs.|72670004

It
may
be
caused|23981006|134198009
by external factors,|261074009
such as infectious disease,|191415002
or
it
may
be
caused|23981006|134198009
by internal dysfunctions,|260521003|386585008
such as autoimmune diseases.|85828009

In humans,|278412004
"disease"|64572001
is
often|70232002
used more broadly to|394850002
refer|439980006
to any condition|260905004
that
causes|134198009
pain,|22253000
dysfunction,|386585008
distress,|69328002
social problems,|161152002
or
death|419620001|268923008
to the person|125676002
afflicted
,
or
similar problems|55607006
for those in contact|52101004|11723008|52101004|70862002|18720000|11723008|18720000|70862002
with the person.|125676002

In this broader sense,|90522003|106148006
it sometimes
includes|55919000
injuries,
disabilities,|21134002
disorders,|64572001
syndromes,
infections,
isolated symptoms,|46651001
deviant behaviors,|844005
and
atypical variations|112231000|40885006
of structure
and
function,|246464006
while
in other contexts|74964007|263491009
and
for other purposes|74964007|363675004
these
may
be
considered
distinguishable categories.

Diseases usually|64572001
affect|4065008
people|125676002
not only physically,
but
also emotionally,
as
contracting|78558002
and
living
with many diseases|64572001
can
alter
one's perspective|421379005
on life,|224130005
and
their personality.|71565002

Death|419620001|268923008
due to disease|64572001
is
called death|419620001|268923008
by natural causes.|510009|134198009

There
are
four main types|421534005|63161005|261664005
of disease|64572001
:
pathogenic disease,|264418008|64572001
deficiency disease,|62522004
hereditary disease,|32895009
and
physiological disease.|1360005|64572001

Diseases|64572001
can
also
be
classified|73504009
as communicable
and
non-communicable disease.|191415002

In many cases,|398241000|413769002
the terms _disease_,|64572001
_disorder_,|64572001
_morbidity_
and
_illness_|39104002
are
used|394850002
interchangeably.

In some situations,
specific terms|69658003
are
considered
preferable.

In an infectious disease,|191415002
the incubation period|406646006
is
the time|410669006
between infection
and
the appearance|386548000|255412001
of symptoms.

The latency period|44104002|259037005
is
the time|410669006
between infection
and
the ability|371150009
of the disease to|64572001
spread|410677005
to another person,|125676002
which
may
precede,|236874000
follow|367409002|421939007
,
or
be
simultaneous|79970003
with the appearance|386548000|255412001
of symptoms.

Some viruses also|49872002
exhibit
a dormant phase,|21191007
called
viral latency,|44104002
in which
the virus hides|49872002|421332005|421332005
in the body|279495008|123037004
in an inactive state.|128975004

For example,
varicella zoster virus|19551004
causes|134198009
chickenpox|38907003
in the acute phase|255251009
;
after recovery
from chickenpox,|38907003
the virus|49872002
may
remain
dormant
in nerve cells|47220008
for many years,|258707000
and
later
cause|23981006|134198009
herpes zoster|4740000|19551004
(shingles|4740000
).

Only
some diseases|64572001
such as influenza|6142004|396425006
are
contagious
and
commonly
believed
to
be
infectious.

The micro-organisms|264395009
that
cause|23981006|134198009
these diseases|64572001
are
known|36692007
as pathogens|264418008
and
include|55919000
varieties
of bacteria,|409822003
viruses,|49872002
protozoa|417396000
and
fungi.|414561005

Infectious diseases|191415002
can
be
transmitted|60117003|258150004
,
e.g.|258795003

by hand-to-mouth contact|85562004|74262004|11723008|85562004|74262004|70862002|85562004|123851003|11723008|85562004|123851003|70862002|85562004|21082005|11723008|85562004|21082005|70862002|85562004|181220002|11723008|85562004|181220002|70862002|302539009|74262004|11723008|302539009|74262004|70862002|302539009|123851003|11723008|302539009|123851003|70862002|302539009|21082005|11723008|302539009|21082005|70862002|302539009|181220002|11723008|302539009|181220002|70862002
with infectious material|260769002
on surfaces,|410678000
by bites|3404009
of insects|106763003
or
other carriers|74964007|47461006
of the disease,|64572001
and
from contaminated water|102414000
or
food|255620007
(often|70232002
via faecal contamination|39477002
)
,
etc.

In addition,|260364009
there
are
sexually transmitted diseases.|8098009

In some cases,|398241000|413769002
micro-organisms|264395009
that
are
not readily
spread|410677005
from person|125676002
to person|125676002
play|300776002
a role,
while
other diseases|74964007|64572001
can
be
prevented|116699007
or
ameliorated
with appropriate nutrition|87276001|384759009
or
other lifestyle changes.|74964007|60134006|243326001|74964007|60134006|263703002

Some diseases,|64572001
such as most
(
but
not
all
)
forms|246176004
of cancer,|363346000|372087000
heart disease|56265001
and
mental disorders,|74732009
are
non-infectious diseases.|191415002

Many non-infectious diseases|191415002
have
a partly
or
completely genetic basis|3950001|3950001|418836005|255395001|255395001|418836005
(
see|281004000
genetic disorder|32895009
and
may
thus
be
transmitted|60117003|258150004
from one generation|421379005
to another.

Social determinants
of health|263775005
are
the social conditions
in which people|125676002
live|419749002
which
determine
their health.|263775005

Illnesses|39104002
are
generally
related|272151006|262094002
to social, economic, political,
and
environmental circumstances.|276339004

Social determinants
of health|263775005
have
been
recognized
by several health organizations|261028005|263775005|21139007
such as the Public Health Agency|310115006|224877003
of Canada|223686002
and
the World Health Organization|263775005|21139007
to greatly
influence
collective
and
personal well-being.|405153007

The World Health Organization's Social Determinants|263775005|21139007
Council
also
recognizes
Social determinants
of health|263775005
in poverty.|11403006

When
the cause|134198009
of a disease|64572001
is
poorly|556001
understood,|66216009
societies
tend
to
mythologize
the disease|64572001
or
use|277889008|419385000
it
as
a metaphor
or
symbol
of whatever
that culture|252398009|61594008
considers
to
be
evil.

For example,
until
the bacterial cause|409822003|134198009
of tuberculosis|371569005
was
discovered
in 1882,
experts variously
ascribed
the disease|64572001
to heredity,
a sedentary lifestyle,|415510005
depressed mood,|366979004
and
overindulgence
in sex,|258139002|365952006|263495000|70256003|57312000
rich food,|228068001
or
alcohol?|419442005|53041004|430837008
all the social ills|367391008
of the time.[15]|410669006

Disease burden|64572001
is
the impact|134293005
of a health problem|263775005|55607006
in an area|42798000
measured|258104002
by financial cost, mortality,|409651001
morbidity,
or
other indicators.|74964007

There
are
several measures|261028005|246445000|261028005|367346004
used|394850002
to
quantify
the burden
imposed
by diseases|64572001
on people.|125676002

The years of potential life lost (YPLL)|258707000|30207005|224130005
is
a simple estimate|13673007|414135002
of the number|410680006|410681005
of years|258707000
that
a person's life|125676002|224130005
was
shortened|359530003
due to a disease.|64572001

For example,
if
a person dies|125676002
at the age|424144002
of 65|264695004
from a disease,|64572001
and
would
probably
have
lived|224130005|419749002
until age 80|424144002
without
that disease,|64572001
then
that disease|64572001
has
caused|23981006|134198009
a loss
of 15 years|258707000
of potential life.|30207005|224130005

YPLL measurements|272391002
do
not
account
for
how
disabled
a person|125676002
is
before dying,|236874000|399069006|421718005|399069006
so
the measurement|272391002
treats|395077000
a person|125676002
who dies suddenly
and
a person|125676002
who
died|419620001|419099009
at the same age|262126009|424144002
after decades
of illness|39104002
as equivalent.|9726003|258726008

In 2004,
the World Health Organization|263775005|21139007
calculated|258090004
that 932 million years|258707000
of potential life|30207005|224130005
were
lost
to premature death.[16]|1090009|419620001|1090009|268923008

The quality-adjusted life year (QALY)|273724008
and
disability-adjusted life year (DALY) metrics|21134002|410617001|224130005|258707000|21134002|410617001|224130005|259039008
are
similar,
but
take|419652001
into
account
whether
the person|125676002
was
healthy|263775005
after diagnosis.|439401001

In addition|260364009
to the number|410680006|410681005
of years|258707000
lost
due to premature death,|1090009|419620001|1090009|268923008
these measurements|272391002
add
part|260726005
of the years|258707000
lost
to
being
sick.

Unlike YPLL,
these measurements|272391002
show
the burden
imposed
on people|125676002
who
are
very sick,|260358002
but
who
live|419749002
a normal lifespan.|17621005|258744000

A disease|64572001
that
has
high morbidity,|75540009|371879000
but
low mortality,|62482003|409651001|371880002|409651001
will
have
a high DALY|75540009|371879000
and
a low YPLL.|62482003|371880002

In 2004,
the World Health Organization|263775005|21139007
calculated|258090004
that 1.5 billion disability-adjusted life years|264623001|21134002|410617001|224130005|258707000
were
lost
to disease|64572001
and
injury.[16]

Many diseases|260396001|64572001
and
disorders|64572001
can
be
prevented|116699007
through a variety
of means.|255586005

These
include|55919000
sanitation,
proper nutrition,|87276001|384759009
adequate exercise,|51117008|61686008|88323005|61686008
vaccinations,
and
other self-care|74964007|384758001
and
public health measures.|310115006|246445000|310115006|367346004

Medical therapies|243121000
or
treatments|276239002
are
efforts to|19487008
cure
or
improve|385425000|3442003|385633008
a disease|64572001
or
other health problem.|74964007|263775005|55607006

In the medical field,|74188005|255798002
therapy|276239002
is
synonymous
with the word _treatment_.|255373000|276239002|255373000|416118004

Among psychologists,|59944000
the term
may
refer|439980006
specifically
to psychotherapy|75516001
or
"talk therapy".|276239002|87335007|276239002|286376008|276239002

Common treatments|72906007|276239002
include|55919000
medications,|410942007
surgery,|83578000
medical devices,|303607000
and
self-care.|384758001

Treatments|276239002
may
be
provided
by an organized health care system,|385650005|263775005|246333005
or
informally,
by the patient|116154003
or
family members.|303071001

A prevention|169443000
or
preventive therapy|262073000|276239002|129428001|276239002
is
a way to
avoid
an injury,
sickness,|39104002
or
disease|64572001
in the first place.|255216001|257557008|255216001|421066005|232714002|257557008|232714002|421066005

A treatment|276239002|416118004
or
cure
is
applied|410618006
after a medical problem|74188005|55607006
has
already
started.|385652002

A treatment|276239002|416118004
attempts
to
improve|385425000|3442003|385633008
or
remove|127485006
a problem,|55607006
but
treatments|276239002
may
not
produce
permanent cures,|6934004
especially
in chronic diseases.|27624003

Cures
are
a subset
of treatments|276239002
that reverse diseases completely|64572001
or
end|261782000|422117008
medical problems permanently.|74188005|55607006

Many diseases|260396001|64572001
that
cannot
be
completely
cured
are
still treatable.

Pain management|278414003
(also called pain medicine|22253000|410942007
)
is
that branch|127484005
of medicine|410942007
employing|224363007
an interdisciplinary approach
to the relief|224978009
of pain|22253000
and
improvement
in the quality|263496004
of life|224130005
of those living
with pain[17]|22253000

Treatment|276239002|416118004
for medical emergencies|74188005|25876001
must
be
provided
promptly,
often|70232002
through an emergency department|225728007
or
,
in less critical situations,|276139006|263796003
through an urgent care facility.|103391001

Epidemiology
is
the study|110465008|224699009
of the factors
that cause|134198009
or
encourage
diseases.|64572001

Some diseases|64572001
are
more common|242762006|72906007
in certain geographic areas,|17162000|42798000
among people|125676002
with certain genetic|17162000|3950001|17162000|255395001
or
socioeconomic characteristics,
or
at different times|263735002|410669006|263735002|417929005
of the year.|258707000|259039008

Epidemiology
is
considered
a cornerstone methodology
of public health research,|310115006
and
is
highly|75540009
regarded
in evidence-based medicine|18669006|410942007|18669006|418836005|410942007
for identifying risk factors|7882003|80943009
for disease.|64572001

In the study|110465008|224699009
of communicable
and
non-communicable diseases,|191415002
the work|261041009
of epidemiologists
ranges
from outbreak investigation to study design,|443684005|386053000|110465008|443684005|386053000|224699009
data collection
and
analysis|272389005
including|55919000
the development|278923009
of statistical models to
test|269814003|272393004
hypotheses
and
the documentation|23745001
of results|394617004
for submission
to peer-reviewed journals.|386387004

Epidemiologists also
study|110465008|224699009
the interaction
of diseases|64572001
in a population,|385436007|389109008
a condition|260905004
known|36692007
as a syndemic.

Epidemiologists
rely
on a number|410680006|410681005
of other scientific disciplines|74964007
such as biology|12893009
(to better|3442003
understand|66216009
disease processes|64572001|415178003
)
,
biostatistics
(
the current raw information|15240007|6304003
available|103328004
)
,
Geographic Information Science
(to
store|440276004
data
and
map disease patterns|64572001|272135003
)
and
social science disciplines
(to better|3442003
understand|66216009
proximate
and
distal risk factors|46053002|80943009
).

In studying diseases,|110465008|64572001|224699009|64572001
epidemiology
faces|89545001
the challenge
of defining
them.

Especially
for poorly understood diseases,|556001|66216009|64572001
different groups|263735002|261586004|263735002|160481000
might
use|277889008|419385000
significantly different definitions.|263735002

Without an agreed-
upon definition,
different researchers|263735002
will
find
very different numbers|260358002|263735002|410680006|260358002|263735002|410681005
of cases|398241000|413769002
and
characteristics
of the disease.[18]|64572001

How
a society
responds
to diseases|64572001
is
the subject
of medical sociology.|74188005

A condition|260905004
may
be
considered
to
be
a disease|64572001
in some
cultures|252398009|61594008
or
eras
but
not
in others.|74964007

For example,
obesity|414915002
can
represent
wealth|224166006
and
abundance,
and
is
a status symbol|263490005
in famine-prone areas|1240000|42798000
and
some
places|257557008
hard-hit|72505002|30166007
by HIV/AIDS.|19030005|62479008|86406008|62479008|402916007|62479008

Epilepsy|313307000
is
considered
a sign|72670004
of spiritual gifts|221668007
among the Hmong people.[21]|125676002

Sickness|39104002
confers
the social legitimization
of certain benefits,|17162000
such as illness benefits,|39104002
work avoidance,|261041009
and
being
looked|386548000
after
by others.|74964007

The person|125676002
who
is
sick
takes|419652001
on a social role
called
the sick role.

A person|125676002
who
responds
to a dreaded disease,|64572001
such as cancer,|363346000|372087000
in a culturally acceptable fashion
may
be
publicly
and
privately
honored
with higher social status.|75540009|82996008|371879000|82996008

In return|7528007
for these benefits,
the sick person|125676002
is
obligated to
seek
treatment|276239002|416118004
and
work|261041009
to
become
well|20572008
once
more.|242762006

As a comparison,
consider
pregnancy,|289908002
which
is
not
interpreted|363714003
as a disease|64572001
or
sickness,|39104002
even
if
the mother|72705000
and
baby|418119000
may
both
benefit
from medical care.|74188005

Most religions grant exceptions
from religious duties|62458008
to people|125676002
who
are
sick.

For example,
one|421379005
whose life|224130005
would
be
endangered
by fasting|16985007
on Yom Kippur
or
during Ramadan
is
exempted
from the requirement,
or
even
forbidden
from participating.

People|125676002
who
are
sick
are
also
exempted
from social duties.

For example,
ill health|367391008|263775005
is
the only socially acceptable reason|50607009|410666004|420295001|410666004
for an American to
refuse|58377000
an invitation
to the White House.[23]|413773004|261770009|264657009|413773004|257630004|264657009|185984009|261770009|264657009|185984009|257630004|264657009|371251000|261770009|264657009|371251000|257630004|264657009

The identification|286672002|7882003
of a condition|260905004
as a disease,|64572001
rather than
as
simply
a variation|40885006
of human structure|278412004
or
function,|246464006
can
have
significant social|386134007
or
economic implications.

The controversial recognitions|312020002
as diseases|64572001
of repetitive stress injury (RSI)|262188008
and
post-traumatic stress disorder|47505003
(also
known|36692007
as "Soldier's heart",|409712001
"shell shock",|279611005
and
"combat fatigue"|47505003
)
has
had
a number|410680006|410681005
of positive|258758003|10828004
and
negative effects|260385009|253861007
on the financial
and
other responsibilities|74964007
of governments,
corporations
and
institutions|385437003
towards individuals,|125676002|385435006
as well as
on the individuals|125676002|385435006
themselves.

The social implication
of viewing aging|246516004|248280005
as a disease|64572001
could
be
profound,
though
this classification|73504009
is
not yet widespread.|85333001

Lepers
were
people|125676002
who
were
historically
shunned
because
they
had
an infectious disease,|191415002
and
the term "leper" still
evokes|410658008
social stigma.|9097005

Fear|1402001
of disease|64572001
can
still
be
a widespread social phenomenon,|85333001
though
not
all diseases|64572001
evoke|410658008
extreme social stigma.|12565001|9097005

Social standing|10904000
and
economic status|73831000
affect|4065008
health.|263775005

Diseases|64572001
of poverty|11403006
are
diseases|64572001
that
are
associated|47429007
with poverty|11403006
and
low social status|62482003|82996008|371880002|82996008
;
diseases|64572001
of affluence|224166006
are
diseases|64572001
that
are
associated|47429007
with high social|75540009|371879000
and
economic status.|73831000

Which diseases|64572001
are
associated|47429007
with which
states|398070004
varies
according to time,|410669006
place,|257557008|421066005
and
technology.

Some diseases,|64572001
such as diabetes mellitus,|73211009
may
be
associated|47429007
with
both
poverty|11403006
(poor food choices|11403006|255620007|255351007|255620007
)
and
affluence|224166006
(long lifespans|255511005
and
sedentary lifestyles|415510005
)
,
through different mechanisms.|263735002|257544000

The term diseases|64572001
of civilization
describes
diseases|64572001
that
are
more common|242762006|72906007
among older people.|70753007|125676002

For example,
cancer|363346000|372087000
is
far more common|46053002|72906007
in societies
in which
most members|394852005
live|419749002
until
they
reach|282679008
the age|424144002
of 80
than
in societies
in which
most members|394852005
die|419620001|399069006|419099009
before|236874000|421718005
they
reach|282679008
the age|424144002
of 50.

An illness narrative|39104002
is
a way
of organizing|385650005
a medical experience|74188005
into a coherent story
that
illustrates
the sick individual's personal experience.|125676002|385435006

People|125676002
use|277889008|419385000
metaphors to
make
sense|106148006
of their experiences
with disease.|64572001

The metaphors
move|302000008|384598002|370125004
disease|64572001
from an objective thing|410518001|260224007
that
exists
to an affective experience.

The most popular metaphors|4757001
draw
on military concepts|302314004
:
Disease|64572001
is
an enemy
that
must
be
feared|1402001
,
fought,|248005005
battled,
and
routed.|284009009

The patient|116154003
or
the healthcare provider
is
a warrior,
rather than
a passive victim
or
bystander.

The agents|260872001
of communicable diseases|191415002
are
invaders
;
non-communicable diseases|191415002
constitute
internal insurrection|260521003|257875004
or
civil war.|257874000

Because
the threat
is
urgent, perhaps|103391001
a matter
of life and death, unthinkably radical, even oppressive, measures|224130005|419620001|32948009|246445000|224130005|419620001|32948009|367346004|224130005|419620001|255612005|246445000|224130005|419620001|255612005|367346004|224130005|268923008|32948009|246445000|224130005|268923008|32948009|367346004|224130005|268923008|255612005|246445000|224130005|268923008|255612005|367346004
are
society's
and
the patient's moral duty|116154003
as
they courageously
mobilize|183376001|302044006
to struggle
against destruction.|64597002

The War
on Cancer|363346000|372087000
is
an example
of this metaphorical use|277889008|419385000
of language.[24]|61909002

Another class|258391009
of metaphors
describes
the experience
of illness|39104002
as a journey
:
The person travels|125676002|420008001
to
or
from a place|257557008|421066005
of disease,|64572001
and
changes|243326001|263703002
himself,
discovers
new information,|7147002
or
increases|260366006
his experience
along the way.

He
may
travel|420008001
"
on the road|272510001
to recovery"
or
make
changes|243326001|263703002
to "
get
on the right track".|24028007|257719005

Some
are
explicitly immigration-themed
:
the patient|116154003
has
been
exiled
from the home territory|261770009|398070004
of health|263775005
to the land|224718008
of the ill,|367391008
changing|243326001|263703002
identity|247889000
and
relationships|272151006
in the process.[25]|415178003

Some metaphors
are
disease-specific.|64572001|69658003

Slavery
is
a common metaphor|72906007
for addictions|32709003
:
The alcoholic|228281002
is
enslaved
by drink,|226465004
and
the smoker|77176002
is
captive
to nicotine.|68540007

Some cancer patients|363346000|116154003|372087000|116154003
treat|395077000
the loss
of their hair|386045008|119326000
from chemotherapy|416608005|367336001
as a metonymy
or
metaphor
for all
the losses
caused|23981006|134198009
by the disease.[24]|64572001

Some diseases|64572001
are
used|394850002
as metaphors
for social ills|367391008
:
"Cancer"|363346000|372087000
is
a common description|72906007
for anything
that
is
endemic
and
destructive|255303004
in society,
such as poverty,|11403006
injustice,
or
racism.

AIDS|62479008
was
seen
as a divine judgment|61254005
for moral decadence,
and
only
by purging
itself
from the "pollution"|102410009
of the "invader"
could
society
become
healthy again.|263775005

Authors|308004006
in the 19th century commonly used tuberculosis|394850002|371569005
as a symbol
and
a metaphor
for transcendence.

Victims
of the disease|64572001
were
portrayed
in literature
as
having
risen
above daily life to|69620002|224130005
become
ephemeral objects|260787004
of spiritual
or
artistic achievement.|159062006

In the 20th century,
after
its cause|134198009
was
better understood,|3442003|66216009
the same disease|262126009|64572001
became
the emblem
of poverty,|11403006
squalor,
and
other social problems.[25]|74964007|161152002
