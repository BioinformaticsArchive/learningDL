(
not to
be
confused|286933003
with hyperglycemia|80394007
is
an abnormally diminished content|1250004|276824008
of glucose|67079006|72191006
in the blood.|87612001|119273009

The term literally means "low sugar blood"|255586005|62482003|2331003|87612001|255586005|62482003|2331003|119273009|255586005|62482003|74801000|87612001|255586005|62482003|74801000|119273009|255586005|371880002|2331003|87612001|255586005|371880002|2331003|119273009|255586005|371880002|74801000|87612001|255586005|371880002|74801000|119273009

It
can
produce
a variety
of symptoms
and
effects|253861007
but
the principal problems|63161005|55607006|302311007|55607006
arise|68727004
from an inadequate supply|71978007|425398004
of glucose|67079006|72191006
to the brain,|12738006|258335003
resulting|42752001
in impairment|40226000
of function|246464006
(neuroglycopenia.|237631006

Effects|253861007
can
range
from mild dysphoria|255604002|30819006
to more serious issues|242762006|42745003|55607006
such as seizures,|91175000
unconsciousness,|418107008
and
(rarely|103356009
)
permanent brain damage|6934004|2470005
or
death.[2]|419620001|268923008

The most common forms|4757001|72906007|246176004
of hypoglycemia|271327008
occur|272120004
as a complication|116223007|263718001
of treatment|276239002|416118004
of diabetes mellitus|73211009
with insulin|412222002
or
oral medications.|260548002|410942007

Hypoglycemia|271327008
is
less common|276139006|72906007|263796003|72906007
in non-diabetic persons,|125676002
but
can
occur|272120004
at any age.|424144002

Among the causes|134198009
are
excessive insulin|260378005|412222002
produced
in the body|279495008|123037004
(hyperinsulinemia,|83469008
inborn error
of metabolism,|47722004
medications|410942007
and
poisons,|35331000
alcohol,|419442005|53041004|430837008
hormone deficiencies,|87568004|260372006|87568004|248325000
prolonged starvation,|255224006|212968006
alterations
of metabolism|47722004
associated|47429007
with infection,
and
organ failure.|410653004|76797004

Hypoglycemia|271327008
is
treated|28995006
by restoring
the blood glucose level|365812005
to normal|17621005|258744000
by the ingestion|111984006
or
administration|413454004|416118004
of dextrose|67079006
or
carbohydrate foods.|227991002

In more severe circumstances|242762006|24484000
it
is
treated|28995006
by injection|28289002|385218009|129326001
or
infusion|447826007
of glucagon.|66603002

Recurrent hypoglycemia|255227004|271327008
may
be
prevented|116699007
by reversing
or
removing|127485006
the underlying cause,|134198009
by increasing|260369004
the frequency|260864003|272123002
of meals,
with medications|410942007
like diazoxide,|387328001
octreotide,|109053000
or
glucocorticoids,|419933005
or
by surgical removal|118292001|128303001|128304007
of much|242762006|4757001
of the pancreas.|15776009|181277001

The level|258395000|276625007
of blood glucose low enough to|33747003|62482003|33747003|371880002
define
hypoglycemia|271327008
may
be
different|263735002
for different people,|263735002|125676002
in different circumstances,|263735002
and
for different purposes,|263735002|363675004
and
occasionally
has
been
a matter
of controversy.

Most healthy adults|4757001|102512003
maintain|385630006
fasting glucose levels|16985007|365811003
above 4.0 mmol/L (72 mg/dl|260308009|414744005|427264006|260308009|258718000|258797006
)
,
and
develop
symptoms
of hypoglycemia|271327008
when
the glucose|67079006|72191006
falls|1912002
below 4 mmol/L.|260308009|258718000

It
can
sometimes
be
difficult to|52925006
determine
whether
a person's symptoms|125676002
are
due to hypoglycemia.|271327008

Criteria
referred|439980006
to
as
Whipple's triad
are
used|394850002
to
determine
a diagnosis|439401001
of hypoglycemia|271327008
:
[4]|260308009

Hypoglycemia|271327008
(common usage|72906007|277889008
)
is
also
a term
in popular culture|252398009|61594008
and
alternative medicine|350084001
for a common, often|72906007|70232002
self-diagnosed, condition|439401001|260905004
characterized
by shakiness
and
altered mood|18963009
and
thinking,|88952004
but
without measured low glucose|258104002|62482003|67079006|258104002|62482003|72191006|258104002|371880002|67079006|258104002|371880002|72191006
or
risk|30207005
of severe harm.|24484000

It
is
treated|28995006
by changing eating patterns.|243326001|162549003|263703002|162549003

In those
treated|28995006
for diabetes|73211009
a diagnosis|439401001
of hypoglycemia|271327008
can
be
made
based|418836005
on the presence|386397008
of a low blood sugar|271327008
alone.|105529008

Otherwise Whipple's triad
is
required
which
include|55919000
symptoms
consistent|385433004
with hypoglycemia,|271327008
a low blood sugar,|271327008
and
resolution
of these symptoms
once the blood sugar|87612001|2331003|87612001|74801000|119273009|2331003|119273009|74801000
improves.[5]|385425000|3442003|385633008

Throughout a 24 hour period blood plasma glucose levels|123027009|259037005|365812005|419185008|259029002|259037005|365812005|419185008
are
generally
maintained|385630006
between 4-8 mmol/L (72|260308009|258718000
and
144 mg/dL|258797006
).[6]
:
11
Although
3.3|260313008
or
3.9 mmol/L (60|260287003|258718000
or
70 mg/dL|258797006
)
is
commonly
cited
as the lower limit|261122009|255469002
of normal glucose,|17621005|67079006|17621005|72191006|258744000|67079006|258744000|72191006
symptoms
of hypoglycemia usually|271327008
do
not
occur|272120004
until 2.8|260306008
to 3.0 mmol/L (50|260313008|258718000
to 54 mg/dL|258797006
).[7]

The precise level|258395000|276625007
of glucose|67079006|72191006
considered
low enough to|62482003|371880002
define
hypoglycemia|271327008
is
dependent|371154000
on
(1
)
the measurement method,|370129005
(2
)
the age|424144002
of the person,|125676002
(3
)
presence|386397008
or
absence|2667000|418560003
of effects,|253861007
and
(4
)
the purpose|363675004
of the definition.

While
there
is
no disagreement
as to the normal range|260395002
of blood sugar,|87612001|2331003|87612001|74801000|119273009|2331003|119273009|74801000
debate
continues|255238004
as to what degree|258395000|246173007
of hypoglycemia warrants medical evaluation|271327008|74188005|271327008|74188005|386053000
or
treatment,|276239002|416118004
or
can
cause|23981006|134198009
harm.[8][9][10]

Glucose concentrations|250417005|365657003
are
expressed
as milligrams|258684004
per deciliter|258771000
(mg/dL|258797006
or
mg/100 mL|258798001
)
in the United States,|223688001
Japan,|223583001
Spain,|223680008
France,|223666001
Belgium,|223660007
Egypt,|223511009
Saudi Arabia,|223616007
Colombia|223717005
and
Israel,|223609006
while
millimoles|258718000
per liter|258770004
(mmol/L|258718000
or
mM
)
are
the units|258666001
used|394850002
in most
of the rest|258157001
of the world.

Glucose concentrations|250417005|365657003
expressed
as mg/dL|258797006
can
be
converted
to mmol/L|258718000
by
dividing|422033008
by 18.0 g/dmol|258795003
(
the molar mass|421456005|300848003|421456005|118538004
of glucose|67079006|72191006
).

For example,
a glucose concentration|250417005|365657003
of 90 mg/dL|264705001|258797006|264703008|258797006
is
5.0 mmol/L|264706000|258718000|264605009|258718000
or
5.0 mM.|264706000|264605009

Blood glucose levels|365812005
discussed
in this article
are
venous plasma|29092000|419185008|263925004|419185008
or
serum levels|67922002|258395000
measured|258104002
by standard,
automated glucose oxidase methods|8359006|20160006|260686004|8359006|20160006|272394005
used|394850002
in medical laboratories.|74188005|261904005

For clinical purposes,|58147004|363675004
plasma|419185008
and
serum levels|67922002|258395000
are
similar enough to
be
interchangeable.

Arterial plasma|51114001|419185008|263954005|419185008
or
serum levels|67922002|258395000
are
slightly higher|425404009|75540009|425404009|371879000
than venous levels,|29092000|258395000|263925004|258395000
and
capillary levels|20982000|258395000|255416003|258395000
are
typically
in
between.

This difference|263735002
between arterial|51114001|263954005
and
venous levels|29092000|258395000|263925004|258395000
is
small|255507004
in the fasting state|16985007
but
is
amplified
and
can
be
greater|263768009
than 10%
in the postprandial state.|24863003|398070004

On the other hand,|74964007|85562004|74964007|302539009
whole blood glucose levels|260232004|365812005
(
e.g.
,
by fingerprick meters|272185007
are
about 10%-15% lower|261122009
than venous plasma levels.|29092000|419185008|258395000|263925004|419185008|258395000

Furthermore,
available fingerstick glucose meters|103328004|278450005|67079006|272185007|103328004|278450005|72191006|272185007
are
only
warranted to
be
accurate|263656005
to within 15%
of a simultaneous laboratory value|79970003|261904005
under optimal conditions,|260905004
_[citation
needed|410525008|103325001

and
home use|261770009|277889008|261770009|419385000
in the investigation|386053000
of hypoglycemia|271327008
is
fraught
with misleading low numbers.|62482003|410680006|62482003|410681005|371880002|410680006|371880002|410681005

In other words,|74964007|255373000
a meter glucose reading|258669008|67079006|50360004|258669008|72191006|50360004
of 39 mg/dL|258797006
could
be
properly
obtained|398092000
from a person|125676002
whose laboratory serum glucose|261904005|22569008
was
53 mg/dL|258797006
;
even wider variations|90522003|40885006
can
occur|272120004
with "real world" home use.|261770009|277889008|261770009|419385000

Two other factors significantly|420797005
affect|4065008
glucose measurement|36048009
:
hematocrit|28317006|365616005
and
delay
after blood drawing.|396540005

The disparity
between venous|29092000|263925004
and
whole blood concentrations|420135007|82742001|260232004|365655006|260232004|250414003
is
greater|263768009
when
the hematocrit|28317006|365616005
is
high,|75540009|371879000
as
in newborn infants,|133933007
or
adults|133936004
with polycythemia.

High neonatal hematocrits|75540009|255407002|28317006|371879000|255407002|28317006
are
particularly likely|2931005
to
confound
glucose measurement|36048009
by meter.|258669008

Second,|81170007|257997001|288495006
unless
the specimen|123038009
is
drawn
into a fluoride tube|372639009|83059008
or
processed immediately to|415178003|49499008
separate|263869007
the serum|67922002
or
plasma|419185008
from the cells,|4421005
the measurable glucose|67079006|72191006
will
be
gradually
lowered|261122009|385440003
by _
in vitro_ metabolism|47722004
of the glucose|67079006|72191006
at a rate
of approximately 7 mg/dL/hr,|26175008|427264006|413952005
or
even more
in the presence|386397008
of leukocytosis.|414478003

The delay
that
occurs|272120004
when
blood|87612001|119273009
is
drawn
at a satellite site|293008|10546003
and
transported|57188001|360300001
to a central laboratory hours|26216008|261904005|258702006
later|260383002
for routine processing|50811001
is
a common cause|72906007|134198009
of mildly low glucose levels|255604002|62482003|365811003|255604002|371880002|365811003
in general chemistry panels.|60132005|261586004

Children's blood sugar levels|410601007|33747003|410601007|365812005|160499008|33747003|160499008|365812005
are
often slightly lower|70232002|425404009|261122009
than adults'.|133936004

Overnight fasting glucose levels|255270004|16985007|365811003
are
below 70 mg/dL|258797006
(3.9 mM|260282009
)
in 5%|264706000|264605009
of healthy adults,|102512003
but
up to 5%|264706000|264605009
of children|410601007|160499008
can
be
below 60 mg/dL|258797006
(3.3 mM|260313008
)
in the morning fasting state.|73775008|16985007

As the duration|103335007
of fasting|16985007
is
extended,|255536004|288467006|255590007
a higher percentage|75540009|118582008|371879000|118582008
of infants|418119000
and
children|410601007|160499008
will
have
mildly low plasma glucose levels,|255604002|62482003|72191006|258395000|255604002|62482003|419185008|365811003|255604002|371880002|72191006|258395000|255604002|371880002|419185008|365811003
usually
without symptoms.

The normal range|260395002
of newborn blood sugars|133933007|87612001|74801000|133933007|119273009|74801000|46068001|87612001|74801000|46068001|119273009|74801000|255407002|87612001|74801000|255407002|119273009|74801000
continues|255238004
to
be
debated.

It
has
been
proposed
that newborn brains|133933007|12738006|46068001|12738006|255407002|12738006
are
able to|371150009
use|277889008|419385000
alternate fuels|49572008|223373004
when
glucose levels|365811003
are
low more readily|62482003|371880002
than adults.|133936004

Experts
continue|255238004
to
debate
the significance|386134007
and
risk|30207005
of such levels,|258395000
though
the trend|30294006
has
been
to
recommend
maintenance
of glucose levels|365811003
above 60?70 mg/dL|258797006
the first day|255216001|258703001|255216001|259032004|232714002|258703001|232714002|259032004
after birth.|237679004|3950001|288563008|3950001

Research
in healthy adults|102512003
shows
that mental efficiency|260375008
declines
slightly|425404009
but
measurably
as
blood glucose|33747003
falls|1912002
below 65 mg/dL|264695004|258797006
(3.6 mM|260281002
)
in many people.|125676002

Hormonal defense mechanisms|278994005|224992003
(adrenaline|387362001|64722001
and
glucagon|66603002
are
normally
activated
as
it
drops|426684005|404218003
below a threshold level|118589004|258395000|118589004|276625007
(about 55 mg/dL|264691008|258797006
(3.0 mM|260313008
)
for most people|125676002
)
,
producing
the typical hypoglycemic symptoms|373299009
of shakiness
and
dysphoria.[18]|30819006
:
1589 Obvious impairment|40226000
may
not
occur|272120004
until the glucose|67079006|72191006
falls|1912002
below 40 mg/dL|259031006|258797006
(2.2 mM|260306008
)
,
and
many healthy people|263775005|125676002
may
occasionally
have
glucose levels|365811003
below 65|264695004
in the morning|73775008
without apparent effects.|253861007

Since
the brain effects|12738006|253861007|258335003|253861007
of hypoglycemia,|271327008
termed neuroglycopenia,|237631006
determine
whether
a given low glucose|62482003|67079006|62482003|72191006|371880002|67079006|371880002|72191006
is
a "problem"|55607006
for
that person,|125676002
most doctors|309343006
use|277889008|419385000
the term _hypoglycemia_ only|271327008
when
a moderately low glucose level|62482003|36048009|62482003|365811003|371880002|36048009|371880002|365811003
is
accompanied
by symptoms
or
brain effects|12738006|253861007|258335003|253861007

Determining
the presence|386397008
of
both
parts|260726005
of this definition
is
not always straightforward,|385666007
as
hypoglycemic symptoms|373299009
and
effects|253861007
are
vague|25615006
and
can
be
produced
by other conditions|74964007|260905004
;
people|125676002
with recurrently low glucose levels|62482003|365811003|371880002|365811003
can
lose
their threshold symptoms|118589004
so
that severe neuroglycopenic impairment|24484000|237631006|40226000
can
occur|272120004
without much warning,
and
many measurement methods|260396001|370129005
(especially glucose meters|67079006|272185007|72191006|272185007
)
are
imprecise
at low levels.|62482003|258395000|371880002|258395000

Diabetic hypoglycemia|271327008
represents
a special case|67995009|398241000
with respect
to the relationship|272151006
of measured glucose|258104002|67079006|258104002|72191006
and
hypoglycemic symptoms|373299009
for several reasons.|261028005|410666004

First,|255216001|232714002
although
home glucose meter readings|261770009|67079006|258669008|50360004|261770009|72191006|258669008|50360004
are
often misleading,|70232002
the probability|2931005
that
a low reading,|62482003|50360004|371880002|50360004
whether
accompanied
by symptoms
or
not,
represents
real hypoglycemia|271327008
is
much higher|242762006|75540009|242762006|371879000|4757001|75540009|4757001|371879000
in a person|125676002
who
takes|419652001
insulin|412222002
than
in someone
who
does
not.

Second,|81170007|257997001|288495006
because
injected insulin|412222002
cannot
be
"
turned|282987006
off,
" diabetic hypoglycemia|271327008
has
a greater chance|263768009
of progressing|255314001
to serious impairment|42745003|40226000
if
not
treated|28995006
,
compared
to most other forms|74964007|246176004
of hypoglycemia.|271327008

Third,|70905002
because
glucose levels|365811003
are
often|70232002
above normal|17621005|258744000
for long periods|255511005|259037005
of time|410669006
(hours,|258702006
days,|258703001
or
months|258706009
)
in persons|125676002
with diabetes,|73211009
hypoglycemic symptoms|373299009
may
sometimes
occur|272120004
at higher thresholds|75540009|118589004|371879000|118589004
than
in people|125676002
whose blood sugar|87612001|2331003|87612001|74801000|119273009|2331003|119273009|74801000
is
usually normal.|17621005|258744000

For all
of these reasons,|410666004
higher meter glucose thresholds|75540009|258669008|67079006|118589004|75540009|258669008|72191006|118589004|371879000|258669008|67079006|118589004|371879000|258669008|72191006|118589004
are
often|70232002
considered "hypoglycemic"|373299009
in people|125676002
with diabetes.|73211009

For all
of the reasons|410666004
explained
in the above paragraphs,|261183002|84942005
deciding
whether
a blood glucose|33747003
in the borderline range
of 45?75 mg/dL|258797006
(2.5-4.2 mM|264655001
)
represents
clinically problematic hypoglycemia|271327008
is
not always simple.|13673007

This
leads|88488004|236874000
people to|125676002
use|277889008|419385000
different "cutoff levels"|263735002|258395000
of glucose|67079006|72191006
in different contexts|263735002|263491009
and
for different purposes.|263735002|363675004

Because of all
of the statistical
and
measurement variations|272391002|40885006
listed
above,|261183002
the Endocrine Society|113331007
recommends
that
a diagnosis|439401001
of hypoglycemia|271327008
as problem|55607006
for an individual person|125676002|125676002|385435006|125676002
be
based|418836005
on the combination|89780004
of a low glucose level|62482003|36048009|62482003|365811003|371880002|36048009|371880002|365811003
and
evidence|18669006
of adverse effects.[4]

Hypoglycemic symptoms|373299009
and
manifestations|250255003|251190009
can
be
divided|422033008
into those
produced
by the counterregulatory hormones|87568004
(epinephrine/adrenaline|387362001|387362001|387362001|64722001
and
glucagon|66603002
)
triggered|410658008
by the falling glucose,|1912002|67079006|1912002|72191006
and
the neuroglycopenic effects|237631006|253861007
produced
by the reduced brain sugar.|260400001|12738006|2331003|260400001|12738006|74801000|260400001|258335003|2331003|260400001|258335003|74801000

Not
all
of the above manifestations|261183002|250255003|261183002|251190009
occur|272120004
in every case|398241000
of hypoglycemia.|271327008

There
is
no consistent order|385433004
to the appearance|386548000|255412001
of the symptoms,
if
symptoms even
occur.|272120004

Specific manifestations|69658003|250255003|69658003|251190009
may
also
vary
by age,|424144002
by severity|272141005
of the hypoglycemia|271327008
and
the speed
of the decline.

In young children,|84422007|410601007|84422007|160499008
vomiting|249497008
can
sometimes accompany morning hypoglycemia|73775008|271327008
with ketosis.|2538008

In older children|31114009
and
adults,|133936004
moderately severe hypoglycemia|24484000|271327008
can
resemble
mania,|231494001
mental illness,|74732009
drug intoxication,|410942007
or
drunkenness.|25702006

In the elderly,|105436006
hypoglycemia|271327008
can
produce
focal stroke-like effects|87017008|230690007|253861007
or
a hard-to-|72505002
define
malaise.|367391008

The symptoms
of a single person|125681006
may
be
similar
from episode|272128006
to episode,|272128006
but
are
not necessarily so
and
may
be
influenced
by the speed
at which glucose levels|365811003
are
dropping,|426684005|404218003
as well as
previous incidents.|9130008

In newborns,|133933007
hypoglycemia|271327008
can
produce
irritability,|55929007
jitters,
myoclonic jerks,|17450006
cyanosis,|119419001
respiratory distress,|271825005
apneic episodes,|248583008|272128006
sweating|161857006
,
hypothermia,|386689009|241970005
somnolence,|271782001
hypotonia,|398152000
refusal to
feed|129007004
,
and
seizures|91175000
or
"spells."
Hypoglycemia|271327008
can
resemble
asphyxia,|66466001
hypocalcemia,|5291005
sepsis,|105592009|91302008
or
heart failure.|84114007|42343007

In
both
young|84422007
and
old patients,|70753007|116154003
the brain|12738006|258335003
may
habituate
to low glucose levels,|62482003|365811003|371880002|365811003
with a reduction|58294000|260400001|289928003
of noticeable symptoms
despite neuroglycopenic impairment.|237631006|40226000

In insulin-dependent diabetic patients|412222002|185482001
this phenomenon
is
termed _hypoglycemia unawareness_|271327008|418107008|271327008|406124004
and
is
a significant clinical problem|386134007|58147004|55607006
when
improved glycemic control|385425000|31509003|3442003|31509003
is
attempted.

Another aspect
of this phenomenon
occurs|272120004
in type I glycogenosis,|7265005
when
chronic hypoglycemia|90734009|271327008
before diagnosis|439401001
may
be
better|3442003
tolerated
than acute hypoglycemia|272118002|271327008
after treatment|276239002|416118004
is
underway.

Hypoglycemic symptoms|373299009
can
also
occur|272120004
when
one|421379005
is
sleeping.|258158006|248220008

Examples
of symptoms
during sleep|258158006
can
include|55919000
damp bed sheets|17461003|5679009
or
clothes|272180002
from perspiration.|74616000|161857006

Having
nightmares|419145002
or
the
act
of crying out|28263002
can
be
a sign|72670004
of hypoglycemia.|271327008

Once the individual|125676002|385435006
is
awake|248218005
they
may
feel|285854004
tired|224960004
,
irritable,|55929007
or
confused|286933003
and
these
may
be
signs|72670004
of hypoglycemia|271327008
as well.[21]|20572008

In nearly
all cases,|398241000|413769002
hypoglycemia|271327008
that
is
severe enough to|24484000
cause|23981006|134198009
seizures|91175000
or
unconsciousness|418107008
can
be
reversed
without obvious harm
to the brain.|12738006|258335003

Cases|398241000|413769002
of death|419620001|268923008
or
permanent neurological damage|6934004|128239009
occurring|272120004
with a single episode|229803000
have
usually
involved|248448006
prolonged, untreated unconsciousness,|255224006|25265005|418107008
interference
with breathing,|14910006|258162000
severe concurrent disease,|24484000|68405009|64572001
or
some other type|74964007|261664005
of vulnerability.

Nevertheless,
brain damage|2470005
or
death|419620001|268923008
has
occasionally
resulted|42752001|394617004
from severe hypoglycemia.|24484000|271327008

The circumstances
of hypoglycemia|271327008
provide
most
of the clues
to diagnosis.|439401001

Circumstances
include|55919000
the age|424144002
of the patient,|116154003
time|410669006
of day,|258703001|259032004
time since last meal,|410669006
previous episodes,|9130008|272128006
nutritional status,|87276001
physical|5880005|19388002
and
mental development,|278923009
drugs|410942007
or
toxins|80917008
(especially insulin|412222002
or
other diabetes drugs|74964007|73211009|410942007
)
,
diseases|64572001
of other organ systems,|74964007|91689009
family history,|57177007
and
response
to treatment.|276239002|416118004

When
hypoglycemia|271327008
occurs|272120004
repeatedly,|27582007
a record
or
"diary"
of the spells
over several months,|261028005|258706009
noting
the circumstances
of each spell|83166007
(time|410669006
of day,|258703001|259032004
relation to|125677006
last
meal,
nature|277302009
of last meal,
response
to carbohydrate,|2331003
and
so forth|223528007
)
may
be
useful
in recognizing
the nature|277302009
and
cause|134198009
of the hypoglycemia.|271327008

An especially important aspect
is
whether
the patient|116154003
is
seriously ill|367391008
with another problem.|55607006

Severe disease|24484000|64572001
of nearly
all major organ systems|255603008|91689009
can
cause|23981006|134198009
hypoglycemia|271327008
as a secondary problem.|2603003|55607006|81170007|55607006

Hospitalized patients,|184091000|116154003
especially
in intensive care units|309904001
or
those
prevented|116699007
from eating,|48263008
can
suffer
hypoglycemia|271327008
from a variety
of circumstances
related|272151006|262094002
to the care
of their primary disease.|56416009

Hypoglycemia|271327008
in these circumstances
is
often multifactorial|70232002
or
even iatrogenic.|255405005

Once
identified|7882003
,
these types|261664005
of hypoglycemia|271327008
are
readily
reversed
and
prevented,|116699007
and
the underlying disease|64572001
becomes
the primary problem.|63161005|55607006|261424001|55607006

It
may
take|419652001
longer to|255511005
recover|74822006
from severe hypoglycemia|24484000|271327008
with unconsciousness|418107008
or
seizure even|91175000
after
restoration|260938008
of normal blood glucose.|166921001

When
a person|125676002
has
not
been
unconscious, failure|418107008|76797004
of carbohydrate to|2331003
reverse
the symptoms
in 10?15 minutes|259027000
increases|260366006
the likelihood|2931005
that hypoglycemia|271327008
was
not
the cause|134198009
of the symptoms.

When
severe hypoglycemia|24484000|271327008
has
persisted
in a hospitalized patient,|184091000|116154003
the amount|107651007
of glucose|67079006|72191006
required
to
maintain|385630006
satisfactory blood glucose levels|365812005
becomes
an important clue
to the underlying etiology.|134198009

Glucose requirements|67079006|72191006
above 10 mg/kg/minute|259027000
in infants,|418119000
or
6 mg/kg/minute|258701004|255507004|286549009|356624006
in children|410601007|160499008
and
adults|133936004
are
strong evidence|260404005|18669006
for hyperinsulinism.|83469008

In this context|263491009
this
is
referred to|439980006
as
the _glucose infusion rate_ (GIR).|67079006|447826007|72191006|447826007

Finally,
the blood glucose response|33747003
to glucagon|66603002
given|419582001
when
the glucose|67079006|72191006
is
low|62482003|371880002
can
also
help
distinguish
among various types|256220008|261664005
of hypoglycemia.|271327008

A rise
of blood glucose|33747003
by more|242762006
than 30 mg/dl|258797006
(1.70 mmol/l)|260305007|258718000
suggests
insulin excess|412222002|260378005
as the probable cause|2931005|134198009
of the hypoglycemia.|271327008

In less obvious cases,|276139006|398241000|276139006|413769002|263796003|398241000|263796003|413769002
a "critical sample"|123038009
may
provide
the diagnosis.|439401001

In the majority
of children|410601007|160499008
and
adults|133936004
with recurrent, unexplained hypoglycemia,|255227004|271327008
the diagnosis|439401001
may
be
determined
by obtaining|398092000
a sample|123038009
of blood|87612001|119273009
during hypoglycemia.|271327008

If
this
*
*critical sample|123038009
*
*
is
obtained _|398092000
at the time|410669006
of hypoglycemia,|271327008
before
it
is
reversed_,
it
can
provide
information
that
would
otherwise
require
a hospital admission|32485007
and
unpleasant starvation testing.|212968006|212968006|272393004

Perhaps
the most common inadequacy|4757001|72906007|71978007
of emergency department care|409971007|182813001
in cases|398241000|413769002
of unexplained hypoglycemia|271327008
is
the failure to|76797004
obtain|398092000
at least
a basic sample|123038009|418836005|123038009
before
giving|419582001
glucose to|67079006|72191006
reverse
it.

Part|260726005
of the value
of the critical sample|123038009
may
simply
be
the proof|229796008
that
the symptoms
are
indeed
due to hypoglycemia.|271327008

More often,|242762006|70232002
measurement|272391002
of certain hormones|17162000|87568004
and
metabolites
at the time|410669006
of hypoglycemia|271327008
indicates|410535002
which organs|410653004
and
body systems|91689009
are
responding
appropriately
and
which
are
functioning|246464006
abnormally.

For example,
when
the blood glucose|33747003
is
low, hormones|62482003|87568004|371880002|87568004
which
raise|260399008
the glucose|67079006|72191006
should
be
rising
and
insulin secretion|412222002|46242002
should
be
completely
suppressed.|245780008

The following|255260001
is
a brief list|359530003|359535008
of hormones|87568004
and
metabolites
which
may
be
measured|258104002
in a critical sample.|123038009

Not
all
tests|269814003|272393004
are
checked|360160009
on every patient.|116154003

A "basic version"|22303008|418836005|22303008
would
include|55919000
insulin,|412222002
cortisol,|396458002
and
electrolytes,|86355000
with C-peptide|39973008|88705004
and
drug screen|370854007|394642008
for adults|133936004
and
growth hormone|56234005|395883003
in children.|410601007|160499008

The value
of additional specific tests|260364009|69658003|269814003|260364009|69658003|272393004
depends
on the most likely diagnoses|4757001|2931005|439401001
for an individual patient,|125676002|116154003|385435006|116154003
based|418836005
on the circumstances
described
above.|261183002

Many
of these levels|258395000
change|243326001|263703002
within minutes,|258701004|255507004|356624006
especially
if
glucose|67079006|72191006
is
given,|419582001
and
there
is
no value
in measuring|258104002|263571004
them
after
the hypoglycemia|271327008
is
reversed.

Others,|74964007
especially
those lower|261122009
in the list,
remain
abnormal even|263654008
after
hypoglycemia|271327008
is
reversed,
and
can
be
usefully
measured|258104002
even
if
a critical specimen|123038009
is
missed.

Hypoglycemia|271327008
is
a common problem|72906007|55607006
in critically ill|367391008
or
extremely low birthweight infants.|276612004

If
not
due to maternal hyperglycemia,|72705000|80394007
in most cases|398241000|413769002
it
is
multifactorial, transient|14803004
and
easily|36203004
supported.|9096001|243114000

In a minority|410599005|255606000
of cases hypoglycemia|398241000|271327008|413769002|271327008
turns|282987006
out to|255529000
be
due to significant hyperinsulinism,|386134007|83469008
hypopituitarism|74728003
or
an inborn error
of metabolism|47722004
and
presents|52101004|246105001
more
of a management challenge.[22]|413454004|119270007

Single episodes|229803000
of hypoglycemia|271327008
may
occur|272120004
due to gastroenteritis|25374005
or
fasting,|16985007
but
recurrent episodes nearly always|263853000
indicate|410535002
either
an inborn error
of metabolism,|47722004
congenital hypopituitarism,|6160004|74728003|255399007|74728003
or
congenital hyperinsulinism.|360337007

A list
of common causes|72906007|134198009
:

By far,|46053002
the most common cause|4757001|72906007|134198009
of severe hypoglycemia|24484000|271327008
in this age range|424144002
is
insulin|412222002
injected|422145002
for type 1 diabetes.|46635009

Circumstances
should
provide
clues fairly quickly
for the new diseases|7147002|64572001
causing|23981006
severe hypoglycemia.|24484000|271327008

All
of the congenital metabolic defects,|276654001
congenital forms|6160004|246176004|255399007|246176004
of hyperinsulinism,|83469008
and
congenital hypopituitarism|6160004|74728003|255399007|74728003
are
likely to|2931005
have
already
been
diagnosed|439401001
or
are
unlikely to
start|255395001
causing new hypoglycemia|23981006|7147002|271327008
at this age.|424144002

Body mass|279495008|300848003|279495008|118538004|123037004|300848003|123037004|118538004
is
large enough to|255509001
make
starvation hypoglycemia|212968006|271327008
and
idiopathic ketotic hypoglycemia|54690008|20825002
quite uncommon|103356009
.

Recurrent mild hypoglycemia|255227004|255604002|271327008
may
fit|91175000|102499006
a reactive hypoglycemia pattern,|317006|272135003
but
this
is
also
the peak age|255587001|424144002
for idiopathic postprandial syndrome,|54690008|24863003
and
recurrent "spells"|255227004
in this age group|424144002|261586004|424144002|160481000|424144002|389109008
can
be
traced|260405006
to orthostatic hypotension|28651003
or
hyperventilation|68978004
as
often|70232002
as demonstrable hypoglycemia.|29683002|271327008

The incidence
of hypoglycemia|271327008
due to complex drug interactions,|103360007|404204005
especially
involving|248448006
oral hypoglycemic agents|373691002
and
insulin|412222002
for diabetes,|73211009
rises
with age.|424144002

Though
much rarer,|84638005|103356009
the incidence
of insulin-producing tumors also|412222002|108369006
rises
with advancing age.|105436006

Most tumors|108369006
causing|23981006
hypoglycemia|271327008
by mechanisms|257544000
other than insulin excess|412222002|260378005
occur|272120004
in adults.|133936004

Like most animal tissues,|5598003
brain metabolism|12738006|47722004|258335003|47722004
depends
primarily
on glucose|67079006|72191006
for fuel|223373004
in most circumstances.

A limited amount|255469002|107651007
of glucose|67079006|72191006
can
be
derived
from glycogen|36998008
stored|440276004
in astrocytes,|78399007
but
it
is
consumed
within minutes.|258701004|255507004|356624006

For most practical purposes,|363675004
the brain|12738006|258335003
is
dependent|371154000
on a continual supply|263730007|425398004
of glucose diffusing|67079006|46638006|72191006|46638006
from the blood|87612001|119273009
into the interstitial tissue|85293002
within the central nervous system|21483005|278199004
and
into the neurons|47220008
themselves.

Therefore,
if
the amount|107651007
of glucose|67079006|72191006
supplied|425398004
by the blood falls,|87612001|1912002|119273009|1912002
the brain|12738006|258335003
is
one|421379005
of the first organs|255216001|410653004|232714002|410653004
affected.|247591002|248448006

In most people,|125676002
subtle reduction|58294000|260400001|289928003
of mental efficiency|260375008
can
be
observed
when
the glucose|67079006|72191006
falls|1912002
below 65 mg/dl|264695004|258797006
(3.6 mM|260281002
).

Impairment|40226000
of action|129264002
and
judgment usually|61254005
becomes
obvious
below 40 mg/dl|259031006|258797006
(2.2 mM|260306008
).

Seizures|91175000
may
occur|272120004
as the glucose|67079006|72191006
falls|1912002
further.|46053002

As blood glucose levels|365812005
fall|1912002
below 10 mg/dl|258797006
(0.55 mM|264691008
)
,
most neurons|47220008
become
electrically silent|18213006|263872000
and
nonfunctional,|42044006
resulting|42752001
in coma.|371632003|405809000

These brain effects|12738006|253861007|258335003|253861007
are
collectively
referred|439980006
to
as
neuroglycopenia.|237631006

The importance
of an adequate supply|51117008|425398004|88323005|425398004
of glucose|67079006|72191006
to the brain|12738006|258335003
is
apparent
from the number|410680006|410681005
of nervous, hormonal|278994005
and
metabolic responses
to a falling glucose level.|1912002|36048009|1912002|365811003

Most
of these
are
defensive
or
adaptive,
tending
to
raise|260399008
the blood sugar|87612001|2331003|87612001|74801000|119273009|2331003|119273009|74801000
via glycogenolysis
and
gluconeogenesis
or
provide
alternative fuels.|223373004

If
the blood sugar level|33747003|365812005
falls|1912002
too low|62482003|371880002
the liver|10200004|181268008
converts
a storage|48122007|440276004
of glycogen|36998008
into glucose|67079006|72191006
and
releases|115956009
it
into the bloodstream, to
prevent
the person|125676002
going
into a diabetic coma,
for a short period|248967002
of time.|410669006

Brief|359530003|359535008
or
mild hypoglycemia|255604002|271327008
produces
no lasting effects|253861007
on the brain,|12738006|258335003
though
it
can
temporarily
alter
brain responses|12738006|258335003
to additional hypoglycemia.|260364009|271327008

Prolonged|255224006
,
severe hypoglycemia|24484000|271327008
can
produce
lasting
damage|37782003
of a wide range.|90522003

This
can
include|55919000
impairment|40226000
of cognitive function,|311465003
motor control,|31509003
or
even consciousness.|106167005

The likelihood|2931005
of permanent brain damage|6934004|2470005
from any given instance
of severe hypoglycemia|24484000|271327008
is
difficult to|52925006
estimate|414135002
,
and
depends
on a multitude
of factors
such as age,|424144002
recent blood|6493001|87612001|6493001|119273009
and
brain glucose experience,|12738006|67079006|12738006|72191006|258335003|67079006|258335003|72191006
concurrent problems|68405009|55607006
such as hypoxia,|389086002
and
availability|103328004
of alternative fuels.|223373004

It
has
been
frequently|70232002
found|404684003
that
those Type 1 diabetics|258191002
found|404684003
"
dead|419620001
in bed"|229772003
in the morning|73775008
after suspected severe hypoglycemia|24484000|271327008|415684004|24484000|271327008
had
some underlying coronary pathology|80891009|394595002
that
led|88488004|236874000
to an induced fatal heart attack.|16404004|399166001|22298006

Recently,|6493001
several|261028005
of these individuals|125676002|385435006
found|404684003
"
dead|419620001
in bed"|229772003
were
wearing
Continuous Glucose Monitors,|255238004|67079006|13288007|255238004|72191006|13288007
which
provided
a history|392521001
of glucose levels|365811003
prior to the fatal event.|399166001|272379006

It
has
been
found|404684003
in several cases,|261028005|398241000|261028005|413769002
that
the fatal event|399166001|272379006
was
preceded|236874000
by
at least two hours|276139006|420797005|258702006|263796003|420797005|258702006
of blood glucose levels|365812005
under 40 mg/dl,|259031006|258797006
possibly lower|60022001|261122009
as the continuous glucose monitors|255238004|67079006|13288007|255238004|72191006|13288007
are
not accurate|263656005
at levels|258395000
below 40 mg/dl.|259031006|258797006

The individuals|125676002|385435006
failed
to
respond
to the audible alarms|39869006
produced
by the continuous glucose monitor|255238004|67079006|13288007|255238004|72191006|13288007
which
may
have
been
"alarming"|39869006
for many hours|258702006
prior to the fatal event.|399166001|272379006

The vast majority
of symptomatic hypoglycemic episodes|264931009|373299009|272128006
result|394617004
in no detectable permanent harm.[26]|6934004

When
suspected hypoglycemia recurs|271327008|246455001|415684004|271327008|246455001
and
a critical specimen|123038009
has
not
been
obtained|398092000
,
the diagnostic evaluation|439401001|439401001|386053000|261004008|261004008|386053000
may
take|419652001
several paths.|261028005

However good nutrition|20572008|87276001|20572008|384759009
and
prompt intake
is
essential.|34325006

When
general health|105724001
is
good,|20572008
the symptoms
are
not severe,|24484000
and
the person|125676002
can
fast normally|16985007|277748003
through the night,|2546009
experimentation
with diet|41829006
(extra snacks
with fat|271590003
or
protein,|88878007
reduced sugar|260400001|2331003|260400001|74801000
)
may
be
enough to
solve
the problem.|55607006

If
it
is
uncertain|64957009
whether "spells"
are
indeed
due to hypoglycemia,|271327008
some physicians|309343006
will
recommend
use|277889008|419385000
of a home glucose meter to|261770009|67079006|258669008|261770009|72191006|258669008
test|269814003|272393004
at the time|410669006
of the spells to
confirm|59156000
that glucoses|67079006
are
low.|62482003|371880002

This approach
may
be
most useful|4757001
when
spells
are
fairly frequent|70232002
or
the patient|116154003
is
confident|225486005
that
he
or
she
can
provoke|410658008
a spell.|83166007

The principal drawback|63161005|302311007
of this approach
is
the high rate|75540009|371879000
of false positive|90213003
or
equivocal levels|42425007|258395000
due to the imprecision
of the currently available meters|15240007|103328004|272185007
:
both
physician|309343006
and
patient|116154003
need|410525008|103325001
an accurate understanding|263656005|66216009
of what
a meter|258669008
can
and
cannot
do
to
avoid
frustrating|224973000
and
inconclusive results.|419984006|394617004

In cases|398241000|413769002
of recurrent hypoglycemia|255227004|271327008
with severe symptoms,|162470006
the best method|260686004|272394005
of excluding dangerous conditions|77765009|260905004
is
often|70232002
a _diagnostic fast_.|439401001|16985007|439401001|277748003|261004008|16985007|261004008|277748003

This
is
usually
conducted|844005
in the hospital,|285201006
and
the duration|103335007
depends
on the age|424144002
of the patient|116154003
and
response
to the fast.|16985007|277748003

A healthy adult|102512003
can
usually
maintain|385630006
a glucose level|36048009|365811003
above 50 mg/dl|258797006
(2.8 mM|260306008
)
for 72 hours,|123028004
a child|410601007|160499008
for 36 hours,|258702006
and
an infant|418119000
for 24 hours.|123027009|259029002

The purpose|363675004
of the fast|16985007|277748003
is
to
determine
whether
the person|125676002
can
maintain|385630006
his
or
her blood glucose|33747003
as long|255511005
as normal,|17621005|258744000
and
can
respond
to fasting|16985007
with the appropriate metabolic changes.|243326001|263703002

At the end|261782000|422117008
of the fast|16985007|277748003
the insulin|412222002
should
be
nearly undetectable
and
ketosis|2538008
should
be
fully
established.|263748003|385645004

The patient's blood glucose levels|116154003|365812005
are
monitored|302805002|13288007
and
a critical specimen|123038009
is
obtained|398092000
if
the glucose falls.|67079006|1912002|72191006|1912002

Despite its unpleasantness
and
expense,
a diagnostic fast|439401001|16985007|439401001|277748003|261004008|16985007|261004008|277748003
may
be
the only effective way to|50607009|255403003|50607009|254648000|420295001|255403003|420295001|254648000
confirm|59156000
or
refute
a number|410680006|410681005
of serious forms|42745003|246176004
of hypoglycemia,|271327008
especially
those
involving|248448006
excessive insulin.|260378005|412222002

A traditional method|263901007|260686004|263901007|272394005
for investigating suspected hypoglycemia|116698004|271327008|116698004|415684004|271327008
is
the oral glucose tolerance test,|90663002|67079006|90663002|72191006|260548002|113076002
especially
when
prolonged|255224006
to 3,|260313008
4,
or
5 hours.|123032005

Although
quite popular
in the United States|223688001
in the 1960s,
repeated research studies|27582007|110465008|27582007|224699009
have
demonstrated
that
many healthy people|263775005|125676002
will
have
glucose levels|365811003
below 70
or
60
during a prolonged test,|255224006|269814003|255224006|255224006|272393004
and
that
many types|261664005
of significant hypoglycemia|386134007|271327008
may
go
undetected
with it.

This combination|89780004
of poor sensitivity and specificity|11403006|35209006|69658003|11403006|365705006|69658003|255351007|35209006|69658003|255351007|365705006|69658003
has
resulted|42752001|394617004
in its abandonment
for this purpose|363675004
by physicians|309343006
experienced
in disorders|64572001
of glucose metabolism.|67079006|47722004|72191006|47722004

The most effective means|4757001|255403003|255586005|4757001|254648000|255586005
of preventing further episodes|46053002|272128006|116699007|46053002|272128006
of hypoglycemia|271327008
depends
on the cause.|134198009

The risk|30207005
of further episodes|46053002|272128006
of diabetic hypoglycemia|271327008
can
often|70232002
(
but
not always
)
be
reduced|260400001
by lowering|261122009
the dose|277406006|408102007
of insulin|412222002
or
other medications,|74964007|410942007
or
by more meticulous attention|242762006|6769007
to blood sugar balance|87612001|2331003|249982003|87612001|2331003|78933003|87612001|2331003|282295000|87612001|74801000|249982003|87612001|74801000|78933003|87612001|74801000|282295000|119273009|2331003|249982003|119273009|2331003|78933003|119273009|2331003|282295000|119273009|74801000|249982003|119273009|74801000|78933003|119273009|74801000|282295000
during unusual hours,|258702006
higher levels|75540009|258395000|371879000|258395000
of exercise,|61686008
or
decreasing alcohol intake.|260371004|160573003

Many
of the inborn errors
of metabolism|47722004
require
avoidance
or
shortening|129350004
of fasting intervals,|16985007|385673002
or
extra carbohydrates.|2331003

For the more severe disorders,|242762006|24484000|64572001
such as type 1 glycogen storage disease,|258191002|29633007
this
may
be
supplied|425398004
in the form|246176004
of cornstarch|346392001
every few hours|57176003|258702006
or
by continuous gastric infusion.|261754007|69695003|261754007|264010009

Several treatments|261028005|276239002
are
used|394850002
for hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia,|271327008
depending
on the exact form|246176004
and
severity.|272141005

Some
forms|246176004
of congenital hyperinsulinism|360337007
respond
to diazoxide|387328001
or
octreotide.|109053000

Surgical removal|118292001|128303001|128304007
of the overactive part|263829006|260726005
of the pancreas|15776009|181277001
is
curative
with minimal risk|255605001|30207005|255604002|30207005
when
hyperinsulinism|83469008
is
focal|87017008
or
due to a benign insulin-producing tumor|20376005|412222002
of the pancreas.|15776009|181277001

When
congenital hyperinsulinism|360337007
is
diffuse|19648000
and
refractory|20646008
to medications,|410942007
near-total pancreatectomy|277752003|9524002
may
be
the treatment|276239002|416118004
of last resort,
but
in this condition|260905004
is
less consistently effective|276139006|255403003|276139006|254648000|263796003|255403003|263796003|254648000
and
fraught
with more complications.|242762006|116223007

Hypoglycemia|271327008
due to hormone deficiencies|87568004|260372006|87568004|248325000
such as hypopituitarism|74728003
or
adrenal insufficiency usually ceases|237785004|386584007
when
the appropriate hormone|87568004
is
replaced.|282089006|370124000

Hypoglycemia|271327008
due to dumping syndrome
and
other post-surgical conditions|74964007|288563008|83578000|260905004
is
best dealt|20572008|3442003
with
by altering diet.|41829006

Including|55919000
fat|271590003
and
protein|88878007
with carbohydrates|2331003
may
slow digestion|419443000|106079008
and
reduce|260400001
early insulin secretion.|264499004|412222002|46242002

Some
forms|246176004
of this
respond
to treatment|276239002|416118004
with a glucosidase inhibitor,|61511001
which
slows|419443000
starch digestion.|412339002|106079008

Reactive hypoglycemia|317006
with demonstrably low blood glucose levels|271327008|258395000|62482003|365812005|371880002|365812005
is
most often|4757001|70232002
a predictable nuisance
which
can
be
avoided
by consuming fat|271590003
and
protein|88878007
with carbohydrates,|2331003
by adding morning|73775008
or
afternoon snacks,|422133006
and
reducing alcohol intake.|260400001|160573003

Idiopathic postprandial syndrome|54690008|24863003
without demonstrably low glucose levels|62482003|365811003|371880002|365811003
at the time|410669006
of symptoms
can
be
more
of a management challenge.|413454004|119270007

Many people|260396001|125676002
find
improvement
by changing eating patterns|243326001|162549003|263703002|162549003
(smaller meals,|263796003|255507004
avoiding
excessive sugar,|260378005|2331003|260378005|74801000
mixed meals|26242008
rather than
carbohydrates|2331003
by themselves
)
,
reducing|260400001
intake
of stimulants|373333006
such as caffeine,|255641001
or
by making lifestyle changes to|60134006|243326001|60134006|263703002
reduce|260400001
stress.|262188008

See|281004000
the following section|255260001|62083003|255260001|118630004
of this article.

Treatment|276239002|416118004
of some
forms|246176004
of hypoglycemia,|271327008
such as
in diabetes,|73211009
involves|248448006
immediately|49499008
raising|260399008
the blood sugar|87612001|2331003|87612001|74801000|119273009|2331003|119273009|74801000
to normal|17621005|258744000
through the ingestion|111984006
of carbohydrates,|2331003
determining
the cause,|134198009
and
taking measures to hopefully|419652001|246445000|419652001|367346004
prevent
future episodes.|272128006

However,
this treatment|276239002|416118004
is
not optimal
in other forms|74964007|246176004
such as reactive hypoglycemia,|317006
where rapid carbohydrate ingestion|255358001|2331003|111984006
may
lead|88488004
to a further hypoglycemic episode.|46053002|373299009|272128006

Blood glucose|33747003
can
be
raised|260399008
to normal|17621005|258744000
within minutes|258701004|255507004|356624006
by taking
(
or
receiving
)
10-20 grams|258682000
of carbohydrate.|2331003

It
can
be
taken|419652001
as food|255620007
or
drink|226465004
if
the person|125676002
is
conscious
and
able to|371150009
swallow.|107160003|421521009

This amount|107651007
of carbohydrate|2331003
is
contained|42504009
in about 3-4 ounces|258692008
(100-120 ml|259035002
)
of orange,|256306003|229776000|371242008
apple,|46051000|67505008|229775001|256311001
or
grape juice|226492005
although
fruit juices|129560007
contain|42504009
a higher proportion|75540009|8212001|371879000|8212001
of fructose|58202007
which
is
more slowly|242762006|419443000
metabolized
than pure dextrose,|67079006
alternatively,
about 4-5 ounces|258692008
(120-150 ml|259035002
)
of regular|17854005
(non-diet|41829006
)
soda|288458006
may
also
work|261041009
,
as
will
about one|421379005
slice
of bread,|226559002
about 4 crackers,|226543002
or
about 1 serving
of most starchy foods.|226529007

Starch|412339002
is
quickly
digested
to glucose|67079006|72191006
(
unless
the person|125676002
is
taking|419652001
acarbose,|386965004
but
adding fat|271590003
or
protein|88878007
retards|19367006
digestion.|106079008

Symptoms
should
begin|255395001
to
improve|385425000|3442003|385633008
within 5 minutes,|264706000|258701004|264706000|255507004|264706000|356624006|264605009|258701004|264605009|255507004|264605009|356624006
though
full recovery|261015003
may
take|419652001
10?20 minutes.|259027000

Overfeeding|302872003
does
not

A mnemonic
used|394850002
by the American Diabetes Association|73211009|263534001|73211009|272151006
and
others|74964007
is
the "rule|10828004
of 15" -
consuming
15 grams|258682000
of carbohydrate|2331003
followed|367409002
by a 15 minute wait,|258701004|255507004|286549009|356624006
repeated|27582007
if glucose|67079006|72191006
remains
low|62482003|371880002
(variable|255372005
by individual,|125676002|385435006
sometimes 70 mg/dl|258797006
).[28][29]

If
a person|125676002
is
suffering
such severe effects|24484000|253861007
of hypoglycemia|271327008
that
they
cannot
(
due to combativeness
)
or
should
not
(
due to seizures|91175000
or
unconsciousness|418107008
)
be
given|419582001
anything
by mouth,|74262004|123851003|21082005|181220002
medical personnel
such as EMTs
and
paramedics,|397897005
or
in-hospital personnel|285201006
can
establish|263748003
IV access|260507000
and
give|419582001
intravenous dextrose,|67079006|255560000|67079006
concentrations|82742001
varying
depending
on age|424144002
(infants|418119000
are
given|419582001
2 ml/kg dextrose 10%,|260306008|396180007|67079006
children|410601007|160499008
are
given|419582001
dextrose 25%,|67079006
and
adults|133936004
are
given|419582001
dextrose 50%
).

Care
must
be
taken|419652001
in
giving|419582001
these solutions|8537005
because
they
can
cause|23981006|134198009
skin necrosis|95347000
if
the IV
is
infiltrated,|47351003
sclerosis|43846000

and
electrolyte disturbances|105593004
if
administered|418283001
incorrectly.

If IV access|260507000
cannot
be
established|263748003|385645004
,
the patient|116154003
can
be
given|419582001
1
to 2 milligrams|260306008|258684004
of glucagon|66603002
in an intramuscular injection.|76601001

sucrose|11320009
is
when
a person|125676002
is
taking|419652001
acarbose.|386965004

Since
acarbose|386965004
and
other alpha-glucosidase inhibitors|74964007|372565001
prevents|116699007
starch|412339002

from
being
broken down|263690001

absorbed
by the body,|279495008|123037004
patients|116154003
taking|419652001
these medications|410942007
should
