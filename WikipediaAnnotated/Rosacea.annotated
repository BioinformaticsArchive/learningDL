*Rosacea|398909004
*
* /ro??ze??i?/|223655008
is
a chronic condition|90734009|260905004
characterized
by facial erythema|89545001|444827008
(redness|386713009|371240000
)
[2]|260306008
and
sometimes pimples.|103605005

Rosacea|398909004
affects|4065008
all ages|424144002
and
has
four subtypes,|421534005|260837004
three affecting|421291004|247591002|421291004|248448006
the skin|119325001|39937001|181469002
and
the fourth affecting|29970001|247591002|29970001|248448006
the eyes|81745001
(ocular type|81745001|261664005|281004000|261664005|261664005
).

Left|7771000
untreated|25265005
it worsens|230993007|390772001
over time.|410669006

Treatment|276239002|416118004
in the form|246176004
of topical steroids|116566001|359540000|116566001
can
aggravate|162473008
the condition.[4]|260905004

It primarily
affects|4065008
Caucasians|413773004|185984009
of north western European descent|414152003
and
has
been
nicknamed
the 'curse
of the Celts'
by some
in Britain
and
Ireland,|223676003
although
recently|6493001
this
has
been
questioned.

Rosacea|398909004
affects|4065008
both
sexes,|258139002|365952006|263495000|70256003|57312000
but
is
almost three times|421291004|410669006|421291004|417929005
more common|242762006|72906007
in women.|224526002

It
has
a peak age|255587001|424144002
of onset|77374008
between 30
and
60._[citation

Rosacea typically|398909004
begins|255395001
as redness|386713009|371240000
on the central face|26216008|89545001|26216008|302549007
across the cheeks,|60819002
nose,|260540009|181195007
or
forehead,|52795006
but
can
also less commonly
affect|4065008
the neck,|45048000|302550007
chest,|261179002
ears,|117590005|1910005
and
scalp.|41695006|181480002

In some cases,|398241000|413769002
additional symptoms,|260364009
such as semi-permanent redness,|6934004|386713009|6934004|371240000
telangiectasia|247479008
(dilation|25322007|71025006|363105001
of superficial blood vessels|26283006|59820001
on the face|89545001|302549007
)
,
red domed papules|386713009|261769008|443871003|371240000|261769008|443871003
(small bumps|255507004
)
and
pustules,|271760008
red gritty eyes,|75705005|263770000
burning|90673000|62404004
and
stinging sensations,|72587008|106148006|72587008|272144002
and
in some advanced cases,|86005002|398241000|86005002|413769002
a red lobulated nose|386713009|260540009|386713009|181195007|371240000|260540009|371240000|181195007
(rhinophyma,|19877001
may
develop.

There
are
four identified rosacea subtypes[7]|421534005|7882003|398909004|260837004
and
patients|116154003
may
have
more
than one subtype present[8]|421379005|260837004|52101004|421379005|260837004|246105001

There
are
a number|410680006|410681005
of variants|40885006
of rosacea,|398909004
including|55919000
:

Triggers
that cause episodes|134198009|272128006
of flushing|271811009
and
blushing|20255002
play|300776002
a part|260726005
in the development|278923009
of rosacea.|398909004

Exposure|71677004|24932003
to temperature extremes|102404009
can
cause|23981006|134198009
the face to|89545001|302549007
become
flushed|271811009
as well as
strenuous exercise,|61686008
heat|88999006
from sunlight,|49926000
severe sunburn,|24484000|23346002
stress,|262188008
anxiety,|48694002|197480006
cold wind,|285686007|308698004|285686007|90569008|82272006|308698004|82272006|90569008|84162001|308698004|84162001|90569008
and
moving
to a warm
or
hot environment|285122005
from a cold one|285686007|421379005|82272006|421379005|84162001|421379005
such as heated shops|88999006|257701001
and
offices|257649000
during the winter.

There
are
also
some food|255620007
and
drinks|226465004
that
can
trigger|410658008
flushing,|271811009
including|55919000
alcohol,|419442005|53041004|430837008
food|255620007
and
beverages
containing|42504009
caffeine|255641001
(especially,
hot tea|264018002|16313001
and
coffee|29263009
)
,
foods|255620007
high|75540009|371879000
in histamines|54235008
and
spicy food.|228071009

Foods|255620007
high|75540009|371879000
in histamine|54235008
(red wine,|58732000
aged cheeses,|424144002|102264005|105436006|102264005
yogurt,|226863004
beer,|53410008
cured pork products|226934003
such as bacon,|226928005
etc.
)
can
even
cause|23981006|134198009
persistent facial flushing|271811009
in those individuals|125676002|385435006
without rosacea|398909004
due to a separate condition,|263869007|260905004
histamine intolerance.|54235008|29544009

Certain medications|17162000|410942007
and
topical irritants|412453003|359540000|412453003
can
quickly
trigger|410658008
rosacea.|398909004

Some acne|88616000|11381005
and
wrinkle treatments|247434009|276239002|27367001|276239002
that
have
been
reported|229059009|223458004
to
cause|23981006|134198009
rosacea|398909004
include|55919000
microdermabrasion
and
chemical peels,|240996002
as well as
high dosages|75540009|277406006|371879000|277406006
of isotretinoin,|429464002
benzoyl peroxide,|91598004
and
tretinoin.|387305002

_Steroid|116566001
induced rosacea_|16404004|398909004
is
the term
given|419582001
to rosacea|398909004
caused|23981006|134198009
by the use|277889008|419385000
of topical|359540000
or
nasal steroids.|260540009|116566001|116566001

These steroids|116566001
are
often|70232002
prescribed
for seborrheic dermatitis.|86708008

Dosage|277406006
should
be
slowly|419443000
decreased|1250004|260400001|260371004
and
not immediately|49499008
stopped|385654001
to
avoid
a flare up.|255532002|353734004

A survey
by the National Rosacea Society|398909004
of 1,066 rosacea patients|260305007|398909004|116154003
showed
which factors
affect|4065008
the most people|4757001|125676002
:
[12]

It
should
be
noted
however
that there
exists
significant disagreement|386134007
amongst sufferers
and
clinicians
as to the validity
of these aggrivators/triggers
being
categorized
as causes|134198009
of rosacea.|398909004

The claim
of rosacea|398909004
being
caused|23981006|134198009
(
as
opposed
to aggravated|162473008|410661009
)
by the above list|261183002
has
not
been
established|263748003|385645004
by epidemiological scientific study[13].|110465008|224699009

Many sufferers|260396001
report|229059009|223458004
that elimination|63911002
of triggers
has
little|281411007|255507004
or
no eventual impact|134293005
on the actual progression|246453008|246450006
of the disease.|64572001

The above list|261183002
should
in no way
be
taken|419652001
as an explanation
of rosacea causes,|398909004|134198009
as
the spectrum disease|64572001
is
more complex|242762006|103360007
than simply
a direct|255589003
or
sole result|57999000|394617004
of habits|90275003
and
diet.|41829006

Richard L.

Gallo
and
colleagues recently|6493001
noticed
that patients|116154003
with rosacea|398909004
had
elevated levels|75540009|258395000
of the peptide cathelicidin[14]|52642002
and
elevated levels|75540009|258395000
of stratum corneum tryptic enzymes (SCTEs).|20281003|66124006|90668006

Antibiotics|255631004
have
been
used|394850002
in the past to|410513005
treat|395077000
rosacea|398909004
but
they
may
only
work|261041009
because
they
inhibit|61511001
some SCTEs.[15]

Intestinal bacteria|261093006|409822003
may
play|300776002
a role
in causing|23981006
the disease.|64572001

A recent study subjected patients|6493001|110465008|116154003|6493001|224699009|116154003
to a hydrogen breath test to|252233000
detect|260373001
the occurrence|272120004
of small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO).|264196002|71219004

It
was
found|404684003
that significantly more patients|116154003
were
hydrogen-positive|2141009|258758003|2141009|10828004
than controls|31509003
indicating|410535002
the presence|386397008
of bacterial overgrowth|71219004
(47% v.

5%,|264706000|264605009
p
<0.001
).

Hydrogen-positive patients|2141009|258758003|116154003|2141009|10828004|116154003
were
then
given a 10-day course|419582001|258703001|288524001|419582001|259032004|288524001
of rifaximin,|412553001
a non-absorbable antibiotic|255631004
that
does
not
leave|7771000|90737002
the digestive tract|122865005
and
therefore
does
not
enter|417985001
the circulation|413854007
or
reach|282679008
the skin.|119325001|39937001|181469002

96%
of patients|116154003
experienced
a complete remission|103338009
of rosacea symptoms|398909004
that
lasted
beyond 9 months.|258706009

These patients|116154003
were
also negative|260385009
when
retested
for bacterial overgrowth.|71219004

In the 4%|260308009
of patients|116154003
that experienced relapse,|263855007|255318003|58184002
it
was
found|404684003
that bacterial overgrowth|71219004
had
returned.|7528007

These patients|116154003
were
given|419582001
a second course|81170007|288524001|257997001|288524001|288495006|288524001
of rifaximin|412553001
which again cleared rosacea symptoms|84989007|398909004
and
normalized hydrogen excretion.[16]|2141009|63911002

In another study,|110465008|224699009
it
was
found|404684003
that
some rosacea patients|398909004|116154003
that tested hydrogen-negative|272393004|2141009|260385009
were
still positive|258758003|10828004
for bacterial overgrowth|71219004
when
using|260676000
a methane breath test instead.|11203008|164790002

These patients|116154003
showed
little improvement
with rifaximin,|412553001
as
found|404684003
in the previous study,|9130008|110465008|9130008|224699009
but
experienced clearance|260695007
of rosacea symptoms|398909004
and
normalization
of methane excretion|11203008|63911002
following|255260001
administration|413454004|416118004
of the antibiotic metronidazole,|255631004|372602008
which
is
effective|255403003|254648000
at targeting methanogenic intestinal bacteria.[17]|11203008|261093006|409822003

These results|394617004
suggest
that optimal antibiotic therapy|281789004
may
vary
between patients|116154003
and
that diverse species|69658003
of intestinal bacteria|261093006|409822003
appear
to
be
capable
of
mediating|73510009
rosacea symptoms.|398909004

This
may
also
explain
the improvement
in symptoms
experienced
by some patients|116154003
when
given|419582001
a reduced carbohydrate diet.|260400001|42239005

Such
a diet|41829006
would
restrict|263856008
the available material|103328004|260769002
necessary
for bacterial fermentation|409822003|40336005
and
thereby
reduce|260400001
intestinal bacterial populations.|261093006|409822003|385436007

Studies|110465008|224699009
of rosacea|398909004
and
demodex mites|25873009
have
revealed|263857004
that
some people|125676002
with Rosacea|398909004
have
increased numbers|35105006|410680006|35105006|410681005|260366006|410680006|260366006|410681005
of the mite,|84073006
especially
those
with steroid|116566001
induced rosacea.|16404004|398909004

When
large numbers|255509001|410680006|255509001|410681005
are
present|52101004|246105001
they
may
play|300776002
a role
along
with other triggers.|74964007

On other occasions demodicidosis|74964007|84638005
(mange|128867006
)
is
a separate condition|263869007|260905004
that
may
have
"rosacea-like" appearances.|398909004|255412001

Rosacea|398909004
has
also
been
implicated
in rosacea|398909004
in
that
it
is
theorised to
be
caused|23981006|134198009
by a reaction|263851003
to bacteria|409822003
in the mite's faeces.[21]|84073006|39477002

Most people|125676002
with rosacea|398909004
have
only mild redness|50607009|255604002|386713009|50607009|255604002|371240000|420295001|255604002|386713009|420295001|255604002|371240000
and
are
never formally
diagnosed|439401001
or
treated.|28995006

There
is
no single, specific test|125681006|69658003|269814003|125681006|69658003|125681006|69658003|272393004|50607009|69658003|269814003|50607009|69658003|50607009|69658003|272393004
for rosacea.|398909004

In many cases,|398241000|413769002
simple visual inspection|13673007|255374006|32750006
by a trained person|118629009|125676002|62193008|125676002
is
sufficient|51117008
for diagnosis.|439401001

In other cases,|74964007|398241000|74964007|413769002
particularly
when
pimples|103605005
or
redness|386713009|371240000
on less-common parts|276139006|72906007|260726005|263796003|72906007|260726005
of the face|89545001|302549007
are
present,|52101004|246105001
a trial|110465008
of common treatments|72906007|276239002
is
useful
for confirming|59156000
a suspected diagnosis.

The disorder|64572001
can
be
confused|286933003
with,
and
co-exist
with acne vulgaris|88616000
and/or
seborrhoeic dermatitis.|86708008

The presence|386397008
of rash|271807003
on the scalp|41695006|181480002
or
ears|117590005|1910005
suggests
a different|263735002
or
co-existing
diagnosis|439401001
as rosacea|398909004
is
primarily
a facial diagnosis,|89545001|439401001|89545001
although
it
may
occasionally
appear
in these other areas.|74964007|42798000

Treating rosacea|28995006|398909004
varies
depending
on severity|272141005
and
subtypes.|260837004

A subtype-directed approach|260837004
to treating rosacea patients|28995006|398909004|116154003
is
recommended
to dermatologists.|18803008

Mild cases|255604002|398241000|255604002|413769002
are
often|70232002
not
treated|28995006
at all,
or
are
simply
covered|255334000
up
with normal cosmetics.|17621005|81024003|258744000|81024003

Therapy|276239002
for the treatment|276239002|416118004
of rosacea|398909004
is
not curative,
and
is
best|20572008|3442003
measured|258104002
in terms
of reduction|58294000|260400001|289928003
in the amount|107651007
of erythema|444827008
and
inflammatory lesions,
decrease|260400001|260370003
in the number,|410680006|410681005
duration,|103335007
and
intensity|103370009
of flares,
and
concomitant symptoms|79970003
of itching,|424492005
burning,|90673000|62404004
and
tenderness.|247348008

The two primary modalities|420797005|63161005|420797005|261424001
of rosacea treatment|398909004|276239002|398909004|416118004
are
topical|359540000
and
oral antibiotic agents.|260548002|255631004

While
medications often|410942007|70232002
produce
a temporary remission|14803004|277022003
of redness|386713009|371240000
within a few weeks,|57176003|258705008
the redness typically|386713009|371240000
returns|7528007
shortly
after
treatment|276239002|416118004
is
suspended.|385655000

Long-term treatment,|276239002|416118004
usually
one|421379005
to two years,|420797005|258707000
may
result|394617004
in permanent control|6934004|31509003
of the condition|260905004
for some patients._[citation|116154003
needed|410525008|103325001
_] Lifelong treatment|276239002|416118004
is
often necessary,|70232002
although
some cases|398241000|413769002
resolve
after a
while
and
go
into a permanent remission._[citation|6934004|277022003

Trigger avoidance|410658008
can
help
reduce|260400001
the onset|77374008
of rosacea|398909004
but
alone|105529008
will
not normally
cause|23981006|134198009
remission|277022003
for all
but
mild cases.|255604002|398241000|255604002|413769002

It
is
sometimes
recommended
that
a journal|433497004
be
kept
to
help
identify|7882003
and
reduce|260400001
food|255620007
and
beverage triggers.[24]

Because
sunlight|49926000
is
a common trigger,|72906007|72906007|410658008
avoiding
excessive exposure|260378005|71677004|260378005|24932003
to sun|49926000
is
widely
recommended.

Some people|125676002
with rosacea benefit|398909004
from daily use|69620002|277889008|69620002|419385000
of a sunscreen|373498003
;
others|74964007
opt
for wearing hats|261368003
with broad brims.|90522003

Like sunlight,|49926000
emotional stress|442347009
can
also
serve
as a trigger|410658008
for rosacea.|398909004

People|125676002
who
develop
infections
of the eyelids|80243003
must
practice
frequent eyelid hygiene.|70232002|80243003|284779002|70232002|265782007|284779002

Daily,|69620002
gentle cleansing
of the eyelids|80243003
with diluted baby shampoo|421399004|418119000|255698008
or
an over-the-counter eyelid cleaner|80288002|80243003|159756005|80288002|265782007|159756005
and
applying|410618006|417924000
warm
(
but
not hot|264018002
)
compresses|37204000
several|261028005

is
recommended._[citation

A recent publication|6493001
discusses
how managing pre-trigger events|119270007|236874000|272379006|119270007|236874000|410658008|272379006|119270007|272113006|272379006|119270007|272113006|410658008|272379006
such as prolonged exposure|255224006|71677004|255224006|24932003
to cool environments|276339004
can
directly
influence
warm room flushing.[25]|271811009

and
topical antibiotics|255631004|359540000|255631004

some redness.|386713009|371240000

Topical azelaic acid|386936005|359540000|386936005
such as Finacea
(15%
)
or
Skinoren
(20%

may
help
reduce|260400001
inflammatory lesions,
bumps
and

Using|260676000
alpha-hydroxy acid peels|263660008|34957004|257890000|263660008|34957004|51979000
may

redness|386713009|371240000
caused|23981006|134198009

symptoms
of ocular rosacea.|200933006

If papules|443871003
and
pustules|271760008
persist
,
then sometimes isotretinoin|429464002
can
be
prescribed.

Isotretinoin|429464002
has
many side effects
and
is
normally
used|394850002
to
treat|395077000
severe acne|24484000|88616000|24484000|11381005
but
in low dosages|62482003|277406006|371880002|277406006
is
proven to|277025001
be
effective|255403003|254648000
against papulopustular
and
phymatous rosacea.|398909004

Some individuals|125676002|385435006
respond
well|20572008
to the topical application|410618006|359540000|410618006
of sandalwood oil|411283007
on the affected area,|247591002|42798000|248448006|42798000
particularly
in reducing|260400001
the prevalence
of pustules|271760008
and
erythema.|444827008

The treatment|276239002|416118004
of flushing|271811009
and
blushing|20255002
has
been
attempted
by means of the centrally
acting ?-2 agonist clonidine,|102498003|372805007
but
this
is
of limited benefit|255469002
on just
this one aspect|421379005
of the disorder.|64572001

The same|262126009
is
true|31874001
of the beta-blockers nadolol|373254001|387482003
and
propranolol.|372772003

If
flushing|271811009
occurs|272120004
with red wine consumption,|58732000
then
complete|255594003
avoidance
helps.

There
is
no evidence|18669006
at all
that antihistamines|372806008
are
of any benefit
in rosacea.|398909004

However
:
people|125676002
with underlying allergies|421961002
and
who
respond
strongly
to foods|255620007
that
are
high|75540009|371879000
in histamine|54235008
or
that
release|58000006|68776005|258760001|129299003|115956009
a lot
of histamine|54235008
in the body|279495008|123037004
do
find
sometimes
that
their flushing symptoms|271811009
diminish|1250004
with oral antihistamines|260548002|372806008
(
for instance loratadine|386884002
).

Another medication|410942007
that
can
help
some people|125676002
with facial flushing|271811009
and
burning|90673000|62404004
is
mirtazapine|386847004
(remeron
).
