*glioma|393564001|416500007
*
*
is
a type|261664005
of tumor|108369006
that starts|255395001
in the brain|12738006|258335003
or
spine.|421060004|44300000|243930007

It
is
called
a glioma|393564001|416500007
because
it
arises|68727004
from glial cells.|2156000

The most common site|4757001|72906007|10546003
of gliomas|393564001
is
the brain.[1]|12738006|258335003

Gliomas|393564001
are
classified|73504009
by cell type,|4421005|246238003
by grade,|258349007|371469007
and
by location.|246267002

Gliomas|393564001
are
named|27468005
according to the specific type|69658003|261664005
of cell|4421005|362837007
they
share
histological features|67151002
with,
but
not necessarily
originate
from.

The main types|63161005|261664005
of gliomas|393564001
are
:

Gliomas|393564001
are
further|46053002
categorized
according to their grade,|258349007|371469007
which
is
determined
by pathologic evaluation|29458008|29458008|386053000
of the tumor.|108369006

Of numerous grading systems|260396001|384739005
in use,|52101004|277889008|52101004|419385000|18720000|277889008|18720000|419385000
the most common|4757001|72906007
is
the World Health Organization (WHO) grading system|263775005|21139007|384739005
for astrocytoma,|254938000
under which tumors|108369006
are
graded|258349007|371469007
from I|42146005|22971001
(least advanced disease ? best prognosis|276139006|86005002|64572001|20481000|263796003|86005002|64572001|20481000
)
to IV
(
most advanced disease ? worst prognosis|86005002|64572001|556001|20481000|86005002|64572001|367391008|20481000|86005002|64572001|230993007|20481000|86005002|64572001|390772001|20481000|86005002|64572001|231877006|20481000
).

Gliomas|393564001
can
be
classified|73504009
according to
whether
they
are
above|261183002
or
below a membrane|83097008
in the brain|12738006|258335003
called
the tentorium.|4566004|244428008

The tentorium|4566004|244428008
separates|13184001|263869007
the cerebrum|11628009|372073000|83678007|263353005
(above|261183002
)
from the cerebellum|113305005|180924008
(
below
).

Symptoms
of gliomas|393564001
depend
on which part|260726005
of the central nervous system|21483005|278199004
is
affected.|247591002|248448006

A brain glioma|254937005
can
cause|23981006|134198009
headaches,|25064002
nausea|422587007
and
vomiting,|249497008
seizures,|91175000
and
cranial nerve disorders|73013002
as a result|394617004
of increased intracranial pressure.|271719001

A glioma|393564001|416500007
of the optic nerve|18234004|180938001
can
cause|23981006|134198009
visual loss.|397540003

Spinal cord gliomas|2748008|393564001|180959008|393564001
can
cause|23981006|134198009
pain,|22253000
weakness,|13791008|260407003
or
numbness|398026008|44077006
in the extremities.|66019005|2592007

Gliomas|393564001
do
not
metastasize
by the bloodstream,
but
they
can
spread|410677005
via the cerebrospinal fluid|65216001
and
cause "drop metastases"|134198009|404218003|128462008
to the spinal cord.|2748008|180959008

A child|410601007|160499008
who
has
a subacute disorder|19939008|64572001
of the central nervous system|21483005|278199004
that
produces
cranial nerve abnormalities|25238003|276654001|244447006|276654001
(especially
of cranial nerve VII|56052001
and
the lower bulbar nerves|261122009|26519002|3057000|261122009|279104005|3057000
)
,
long-tract signs,|255511005|72670004
unsteady gait|22631008
secondary|2603003|81170007
to spasticity,|397790002
and
some behavioral changes|315244000
is
most likely to|4757001|2931005
have
a pontine glioma.[2]|49557009|393564001|49557009|416500007

The exact causes|134198009
of gliomas|393564001
are
not
known.|36692007

Hereditary genetic disorders|255404009|32895009
such as neurofibromatoses|19133005
(type 1|258191002
and
type 2|258195006
)
and
tuberous sclerosis complex|7199000
are
known|36692007
to
predispose
to their development.[3]|278923009

Gliomas|393564001
have
been
correlated
to the electromagnetic radiation|30821001
from cell phones,|4421005|359993007|362837007|359993007
and
a link
between the cancer|363346000|372087000
and
cell phone usage|4421005|359993007|277889008|362837007|359993007|277889008
is
considered plausible,
though
there
is
no conclusive evidence.|18669006

Most glioblastomas|63634009
are
infected
with cytomegalovirus,|407444007
however
the significance|386134007
of this
is
not
known.[5][6]|36692007

High-grade gliomas|24484000|393564001
are
highly-vascular tumors|75540009|126736007
and
have
a tendency to
infiltrate.|47351003

They
have
extensive areas|41118005|42798000
of necrosis|6574001
and
hypoxia.|389086002

Often tumor growth|70232002|108369006
causes|134198009
a breakdown|40091007|125366008
of the blood?brain barrier|20245001
in the vicinity
of the tumor.|108369006

As a rule,|10828004
high-grade gliomas almost always|24484000|393564001
grow
back even
after
complete surgical excision,|79095000|83578000|255594003|128303001
and
so|223528007
are
commonly
called
recurrent cancer|255227004|363346000|255227004|372087000
of the brain.|12738006|258335003

On the other hand,|74964007|85562004|74964007|302539009
low-grade gliomas|428954009
grow
slowly,|419443000
often|70232002
over many years,|260396001|258707000
and
can
be
followed|367409002
without treatment|276239002|416118004
unless
they
grow
and
cause symptoms.|134198009

Several acquired|261028005|255396000
(
not
inherited|255404009
)
genetic mutations|55446002
have
been
found|404684003
in gliomas.|393564001

Tumor suppressor protein 53 (p53)|405831008
is
an early mutation.|264499004|55446002

p53
is
the "guardian|58626002|394619001
of the genome,|18470003
"
which,
during DNA|24851008
and
cell duplication,|4421005|89049001|362837007|89049001
makes
sure
that
the DNA|24851008
is
copied correctly
and
destroys
the cell|4421005|362837007
(apoptosis|20663007
if
the DNA|24851008
is
mutated|55446002
and
can't
be
fixed.|102491009|261010008

When
p53
itself
is
mutated,|55446002
other mutations|74964007|55446002
can
survive.

Phosphatase|130132002
and
tensin homolog
(PTEN
)
,
another protein|88878007
that also
helps
destroy cells|4421005
with dangerous mutations,|55446002
is
itself
lost
or
mutated.|55446002

Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR),|86960007
a growth factor|81286007
that normally
stimulates
cells to|4421005
divide|422033008
,
is
amplified
and
stimulates
cells to|4421005
divide|422033008
too much.

Together,
these mutations|55446002
lead|88488004
to cells|4421005
dividing|422033008
uncontrollably,
a hallmark
of cancer.|363346000|372087000

Recently,|6493001
mutations|55446002
in IDH1
and
IDH2
were
found|404684003
to
be
part|260726005
of the mechanism|257544000
and
associated|47429007
with a more favorable prognosis.|242762006|20481000

The IDH1
and
IDH2 genes|67271001
are
significant|386134007
because
they
are
involved|248448006
in the citrate cycle|59351004|44180009
in mitochondria.|75056005

Mitochondria|75056005
are
involved|248448006
in apoptosis.|20663007

Furthermore,
the altered glycolysis metabolism|47722004
in some cancer cells|88400008
leads|88488004|236874000
to low oxygen|62482003|24099007|371880002|24099007
(hypoxia|389086002
).

The normal response|17621005|258744000
to hypoxia|389086002
is
to
stimulate
the growth
of new blood vessels|7147002|59820001
(angiogenesis.

So
these two genes|420797005|67271001
may
contribute
to
both
the lack|41277001
of apoptosis|20663007
and
vascularization|13018008|255451006
of gliomas.|393564001

Gliomas|393564001
are
rarely curable.|103356009

The prognosis|20481000
for patients|116154003
with high-grade gliomas|24484000|393564001
is
generally poor,|11403006|255351007
and
is
especially so
for older patients.|70753007|116154003

Of 10,000 Americans
diagnosed|439401001
each year|258707000|259039008
with malignant gliomas,|416500007
about half
are
alive 1 year|438949009|258707000|438949009|259039008
after diagnosis,|439401001
and
25%
after two years.|420797005|258707000

Those with anaplastic astrocytoma|20401003|55353007|421463005|55353007
survive
about three years.|421291004|258707000

Glioblastoma multiforme|393563007
has
a worse prognosis|230993007|20481000|390772001|20481000|231877006|20481000
with less|276139006|263796003
than a 12-month average survival|258706009|259036001
after diagnosis,|439401001
though
this
has
extended|255536004|288467006|255590007
to 14 months|258706009
with more recent treatments .[8]|242762006|6493001|276239002

For low-grade tumors,|108369006
the prognosis|20481000
is
somewhat more optimistic.|225648009

Patients|116154003
diagnosed|439401001
with a low-grade glioma|428954009
are
17 times|410669006|417929005
as likely to|2931005
die|419620001|399069006|419099009
as matched patients|33336008|116154003
in the general population.|60132005|385436007|60132005|389109008

The age-|424144002
standardized
10-year relative survival rate|258707000|125677006|258707000|29920004|259039008|125677006|259039008|29920004
was
47%.

One study|421379005|110465008|421379005|224699009
reported|229059009|223458004
that low-grade oligodendroglioma patients|73348003|116154003
have
a median survival|399488007|260528009
of 11.6 years|258707000
;[10]
another
reported|229059009|223458004
a median survival|399488007|260528009
of 16.7 years.[11]|258707000

This group|261586004|160481000|389109008
comprises
anaplastic astrocytomas|55353007
and
glioblastoma multiforme.|393563007

Treatment|276239002|416118004
for brain gliomas|254937005
depends
on the location,|246267002
the cell type|4421005|246238003
and
the grade|258349007|371469007
of malignancy.|363346000|372087000

Often,|70232002
treatment|276239002|416118004
is
a combined approach,|89780004
using|260676000
surgery,|83578000
radiation therapy,|108290001
and
chemotherapy.|416608005|367336001

The radiation therapy|108290001
is
in the form|246176004
of external beam radiation|261074009|30821001|261074009|82107009|261074009|108290001
or
the stereotactic approach|313226005
using|260676000
radiosurgery.|395096001

Spinal cord tumors|126962006
can
be
treated|28995006
by surgery|83578000
and
radiation.|30821001|82107009|108290001

Temozolomide|387009002
is
a chemotherapeutic drug|416608005|410942007|367336001|410942007
that
is
able to|371150009
cross|65145006
the blood?brain barrier effectively|20245001
and
is
currently|15240007
being
used|394850002
in therapy|276239002
for high-grade tumors.|24484000|108369006

For recurrent high-grade glioblastoma,|255227004|24484000|63634009
recent studies|6493001|110465008|6493001|224699009
have
taken|419652001
advantage
of angiogenic blockers
such as bevacizumab|409406007
in combination|89780004
with conventional chemotherapy,|255333006|416608005|255333006|367336001
with encouraging results.[12]|394617004

A 2007 meta-analysis|272389005
compared
surgical resection|118292001|128303001
and

as the initial surgical management option.|884001|83578000|413454004|884001|83578000|119270007|232714002|83578000|413454004|232714002|83578000|119270007

Results|394617004
show
that there
is
insufficient evidence to|71978007|18669006|423437008|18669006
make
a reliable decision.

For high-grade gliomas,|24484000|393564001
a 2003 meta-analysis|272389005
compared
radiotherapy|419815003|108290001
with radiotherapy|419815003|108290001
and
chemotherapy.|416608005|367336001

with radiotherapy.|419815003|108290001

For Glioblastoma Multiforme,|393563007
a 2008 meta-analysis|272389005
