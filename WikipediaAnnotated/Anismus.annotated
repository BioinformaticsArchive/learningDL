*Anismus|83605009
*
*
(
or
dyssynergic defecation|20262006|111989001
)
refers|439980006
to the failure|76797004
of the normal relaxation|17621005|258744000
of pelvic floor muscles|87770006|91727004|361300007|91727004
during attempted defecation.|111989001

Anismus|83605009
can
occur|272120004
in
both
children|410601007|160499008
and
adults,|133936004
and
in
both
men|339947000
and
women|224526002
(
although
it
is
more common|242762006|72906007
in women|224526002
).

It
can
be
caused|23981006|134198009
by physical defects|5880005|6920004|19388002|6920004
or
it
can
occur|272120004
for other reasons|74964007|410666004
or
unknown reasons.|261665006|410666004

Anismus|83605009
that
has
a behavioral cause|844005|134198009
could
be
viewed|246516004
as
having
similarities
with parcopresis,
or
psychogenic fecal retention.|278926001|39477002|36850000

Symptoms
include|55919000
tenesmus|267053000
(
a sensation|106148006|271712005|272144002
where a mass|300848003|118538004
is
felt to|285854004
remain
in rectum|34402009|181261002
after defecation|111989001
)
and
constipation.|14760008

Retention|36850000
of stool|39477002
may
result|394617004
in fecal loading|39477002
(retention|36850000
of a mass|300848003|118538004
of stool|39477002
of any consistency|107646001
)
or
fecal impaction|44635007
(retention|36850000
of a mass|300848003|118538004
of hard stool|75295004
).

This mass|300848003|118538004
may
stretch|122546009
the walls|224727009
of the rectum|34402009|181261002
and
colon,|263977005|302508007
causing|23981006
megarectum|33995003
and/or
megacolon respectively.|33995003

Liquid stool|398212009
may
leak|87952002
around a fecal impaction,|44635007
possibly causing degrees|60022001|23981006|246173007
of liquid fecal incontinence.|33463005|72042002|264312008|72042002

This
is
usually termed encopresis|302752001|302690004
or
soiling|276484003
in children,|410601007|160499008
and
fecal leakage,|39477002|76676007
soiling|276484003
or
liquid fecal incontinence|33463005|72042002|264312008|72042002
in adults.|133936004

Anismus|83605009
is
usually
treated|28995006
with adjustments|410616005|410617001
to the diet,|41829006
such as dietary fiber supplementation.|226311003

It
can
also
be
treated|28995006
with a type|261664005
of biofeedback therapy,|28150003
where
a sensor probe|408746007|7402007
is
inserted|257867005
in the patient's anal canal|116154003|34381000|116154003|245438008
and
records
the pressures|279046003|13543005
exerted|19487008
by the pelvic floor muscles.|87770006|91727004|361300007|91727004

These pressures|279046003|13543005
are
visually
fed|238092004
back
to the patient|116154003
via a monitor|13288007
who
is
able to|371150009
regain
the normal coordinated movement|17621005|404978003|258744000|404978003
of the muscles|91727004
after a few sessions.|57176003

Some researchers
have
suggested
that anismus|83605009
is
an
over-diagnosed|21481007|439401001
condition,|260905004
since
the standard investigations|386053000
or
digital rectal examination|410007005|410006001
and
anorectal manometry
were
shown
to
cause|23981006|134198009
paradoxical sphincter contraction|102546002
in healthy controls,|263775005|31509003
who
did
not
have
constipation|14760008
or
incontinence.|48340000|165232002

Due to the invasive|10179008
and
perhaps uncomfortable nature|277302009
of these investigations,|386053000
the pelvic floor musculature|87770006|361300007
is
thought to|88952004
behave
differently
than
under normal circumstances.|17621005|258744000

These researchers
went
on to
conclude
that paradoxical pelvic floor contraction common finding|102546002|87770006|72906007|404684003|102546002|87770006|72906007|102546002|361300007|72906007|404684003|102546002|361300007|72906007|27699000|87770006|78558002|72906007|27699000|361300007|78558002|72906007
in healthy controls|263775005|31509003
as well as
in patients|116154003
with chronic constipation|236069009
and
stool incontinence,|72042002
and
it
represents
a non-specific finding|10003008|404684003|10003008
or
laboratory artifact|261904005|47973001
related|272151006|262094002
to untoward conditions|260905004
during examination,|5880005
and
that true anismus|31874001|83605009
is
actually rare.|84638005|103356009

Paradoxical anal contraction|102546002|53505006|102546002|263939004
during attempted defecation|111989001
in constipated patients|14760008|116154003
was
first|255216001|232714002
described
in a paper|50833004
in 1985,
when
the term anismus|83605009
was
first|255216001|232714002
used.|394850002

The researchers drew analogies
to a condition|260905004
called
vaginismus,|71787009|79012001
which
involves|248448006
paroxysmal contraction|26593000|78558002
of pubococcygeus|22355009|244958005
(
another muscle|91727004
of the pelvic floor|87770006|361300007
).

These researchers
felt|285854004
that
this condition|260905004
was
a spastic dysfunction|263875003|386585008
of the anus,|53505006|181262009
analogous to ?vaginismus?.|71787009|79012001

However,
the term anismus|83605009
implies
a psychogenic etiology,|278926001|134198009
which
is
not true|31874001
although
psychological dysfunction|74732009
has
been
described
in these patients.|116154003

Hence
:

Latin _ani_ - "|8101008
of the anus"|53505006|181262009

(
Derived
by extrapolation
with the term vaginismus,|71787009|79012001
which in turn|282987006
is
from the Latin _vagina_ - "sheath" + _spasmus_ - "spasm"
)

Many terms|260396001
have
been
used|394850002
synonymously to
refer|439980006
to this condition,|260905004
some inappropriately.

The term "anismus"|83605009
has
been
criticised
as
it
implies
a psychogenic cause.|278926001|134198009

As
stated|398070004
in the Rome II criteria,
the term "dyssynergic defecation"|20262006|111989001
is
preferred|225773000
to "pelvic floor dyssynergia"|87770006|20262006|361300007|20262006
because
many patients|260396001|116154003
with dyssynergic defecation|20262006|111989001
do
not
report|229059009|223458004
sexual|365952006
or
urinary symptoms,|249274008
[4]|260308009
meaning|255586005
that only|50607009|420295001
the defecation mechanism|111989001|257544000
is
affected.|247591002|248448006

Other synonyms|74964007
include|55919000
:

Several definitions|261028005
have
been
offered|410527000
:

Anismus|83605009
is
classified|73504009
as a functional defecation disorder.|386585008|111989001

It
is
also
a type|261664005
of rectal outlet obstruction|255582007|26036001|26036001
(
a functional outlet obstruction|40143009|26036001|246464006|26036001
).

Where anismus|83605009
causes|134198009
constipation,|14760008
it
is
an example
of functional constipation.|197118003

Some authors|308004006
describe
an "obstructed defecation syndrome",|263821009|111989001
of which anismus|83605009
is
a cause.[10]|134198009

The Rome classification|73504009
subdivides
functional defecation disorders|386585008|111989001
into 3 types,|260313008|261664005
[4] however|260308009
the symptoms
the patient experiences|116154003
are
identical.[11]|20323000

It
can
be
seen
from the above classification|261183002|73504009
that many|260396001
of the terms
that
have
been
used|394850002
interchangeably
with anismus|83605009
are
inappropriately specific|69658003
and
neglect|95930005
the concept
of impaired propulsion.|260379002|40226000

Similarly,
some
of the definitions
that
have
been
offered|410527000
are
also too restrictive.

Symptoms
include|55919000
:

To
understand|66216009
the etiology|134198009
of anismus,|83605009
an understanding|66216009
of normal colorectal anatomy|361083003|264267007
and
physiology,|1360005
including|55919000
the normal defecation mechanism,|111989001|257544000
is
helpful.

The relevant anatomy|91723000
includes|55919000
:
the rectum,|34402009|181261002
the anal canal|34381000|245438008
and
the muscles|91727004
of the pelvic floor,|87770006|361300007
especially puborectalis|61495006|244962004
and
the external anal sphincter.|33512008|244969008

The rectum|34402009|181261002
is
a section|62083003|118630004
of bowel|261093006
situated
just
above the anal canal|34381000|245438008
and
distal|46053002
to the sigmoid colon.|60184004

It
is
believed to
act
as a reservoir to|257687008
store|440276004
stool|39477002
until
it
fills
past|410513005
a certain volume,|17162000|118565006|17162000|419569009
at which time|410669006
the defecation reflexes|111989001|87572000|111989001|106146005
are
stimulated.

In healthy individuals,|263775005|125676002|263775005|385435006
defecation|111989001
can
be
temporarily
delayed
until
it
is
socially acceptable
to
defecate.

In continent individuals,|261001000|125676002|261001000|385435006|223497007|125676002|223497007|385435006
the rectum|34402009|181261002
is
able to|371150009
expand|70955005
to a degree to|258395000|246173007
accommodate
this function.|246464006

The anal canal|34381000|245438008
is
the short straight section|359530003|262185006|62083003|359530003|262185006|118630004|367450005|262185006|62083003|367450005|262185006|118630004
of bowel|261093006
between the rectum|34402009|181261002
and
the anus.|53505006|181262009

It
can
be
defined
functionally
as the distance|246132006
between the anorectal ring|112627000|257380004
and
the end|261782000|422117008
of the internal anal sphincter.|82961008|245454006

The internal anal sphincter|82961008|245454006
forms|246176004
the walls|224727009
of the anal canal.|34381000|245438008

The internal anal sphincter|82961008|245454006
is
not
under voluntary control,|255375007|31509003
and
in normal persons|17621005|125676002|258744000|125676002
it
is
contracted|78558002
at all times|410669006|417929005
except
when
there
is
a need|410525008|103325001
to defecate.

This means|255586005
that
the internal anal sphincter|82961008|245454006
contributes
more
to the resting tone|258157001|223628004|258157001|258691001
of the anal canal|34381000|245438008
than the external anal sphincter.|33512008|244969008

The internal sphincter|260521003
is
responsible|394851003
for creating
a watertight seal,|19314006|106980009
and
therefore
provides
continence|261001000|223497007
of liquid stool elements.|398212009|57795002

Puborectalis|61495006|244962004
is
one|421379005
of the muscles|91727004
of the pelvic floor.|87770006|361300007

It
is
skeletal muscle,|127954009|244716004
meaning|255586005
it
is
under voluntary control.|255375007|31509003

The puborectalis|61495006|244962004
originates
on the posterior aspect|255551008
of the pubic bone,|66040006
and
runs|282476009
backwards,|255539006
looping|261913007
around the bowel.|261093006

The point
at which
the rectum|34402009|181261002
joins
the anal canal|34381000|245438008
is
known|36692007
as the anorectal ring,|112627000|257380004
which
is
at the level|258395000|276625007
that
the puborectalis muscle|61495006
loops|261913007
around the bowel|261093006
from
in front.|255549009

This arrangement means|103377007|255586005
that
when
puborectalis|61495006|244962004
is
contracted,|78558002
it
pulls|303370007
the junction|50974003
of the rectum|34402009|181261002
and
the anal canal forwards,|34381000|255540008|245438008|255540008
creating
an angle|1483009
in the bowel|261093006
called
the anorectal angle.|1483009

This angle|1483009
prevents|116699007
the movement|255324009
of stool|39477002
stored|440276004
in the rectum moving|34402009|181261002
into the anal canal.|34381000|245438008

It
is
thought to|88952004
be
responsible|394851003
for gross continence|255344003|261001000|255344003|223497007
of solid stool.|35702001|39477002|78910004|39477002|421378002|39477002

Some
believe
the anorectal angle|1483009
is
one|421379005
of the most important contributors|4757001
to continence.[14]|261001000|223497007

Conversely,
relaxation
of the puborectalis|61495006|244962004
reduces|260400001
the pull|303370007
on the junction|50974003
of the rectum|34402009|181261002
and
the anal canal,|34381000|245438008
causing|23981006
the anorectal angle|1483009
to straighten out.

A squatting posture|282961006|363855006
is
also
known|36692007
to
straighten
the anorectal angle,|1483009
meaning|255586005
that less effort|276139006|19487008|263796003|19487008
is
required to
defecate
when
in this position.[15]|246449006

Distension|25322007
of the rectum normally|34402009|181261002
causes|134198009
the internal anal sphincter|82961008|245454006
to relax|15166001
(Rectoanal inhibitory response,|61511001
RAIR
)
and
the external anal sphincter initially to|33512008|884001|244969008|884001
contract|78558002
(rectoanal excitatory reflex,|87572000|106146005
RAER
).

The relaxation
of the internal anal sphincter|82961008|245454006
is
an involuntary response.

The external anal sphincter,|33512008|244969008
by contrast,
is
made up|255532002|353734004
of skeletal|113192009
(
or
striated muscle|127954009|118252003
)
and
is
therefore
under voluntary control.|255375007|31509003

It
is
able to|371150009
contract|78558002
vigorously|419913006
for a short time.|359530003|410669006|367450005|410669006

Contraction|78558002
of the external sphincter|261074009
can
defer
defecation|111989001
for a time|410669006
by pushing stool|420620005|39477002
from the anal canal|34381000|245438008
back
into the rectum.|34402009|181261002

Once the voluntary signal|255375007
to defecate
is
sent
back
from the brain,|12738006|258335003
the abdominal muscles|28720001
contract|78558002
(straining|102548001
)
causing|23981006
the intra-abdominal pressure to|272114000|251377007
increase.|260366006

the pelvic floor|87770006|361300007
is
lowered|261122009|385440003
causing|23981006
the ano rectal angle|53505006|255582007|1483009|53505006|1483009
to straighten out
from ~90o
to
<15o
and
the external anal sphincter relaxes.|33512008|15166001|244969008|15166001

The rectum now|34402009|181261002
contracts|78558002
and
shortens|129350004|359530003
in peristaltic waves,|28423000
thus
forcing|263760002
fecal material|39477002|260769002
out of the rectum,|34402009|181261002
through the anal canal|34381000|245438008
and
out of the anus.|53505006|181262009

The internal|260521003
and
external anal sphincters|33512008|244969008
along
with the puborectalis muscle|61495006
allow
the feces to|39477002
be
passed
by pulling|303370007
the anus|53505006|181262009
up over|21481007
the exiting feces|5173006|39477002
in shortening|129350004
and
contracting actions.|78558002|129264002

In patients|116154003
with anismus,|83605009
the puborectalis|61495006|244962004
and
the external anal sphincter muscles|33512008|91727004|244969008|91727004
fail
to relax,|15166001
with resultant failure|76797004
of the anorectal angle|1483009
to straighten out
and
facilitate
evacuation|122461007
of feces|39477002
from the rectum.|34402009|181261002

These muscles|91727004
may
even
contract|78558002
when
they
should
relax|15166001
(paradoxical contraction|102546002
)
,
and
this
not only
fails
to straighten out
the anorectal angle,|1483009
but
causes|134198009
it to
become
more acute|242762006|272118002
and
offer|410527000
greater obstruction|263768009|26036001
to evacuation.|122461007

As these muscles|91727004
are
under voluntary control,|255375007|31509003
the failure|76797004
of muscular relaxation|11977004|55394004
or
paradoxical contraction|102546002
that
is
characteristic
of anismus|83605009
can
be
thought|88952004
of
as
either
maladaptive behavior|284499009
or
a loss
of voluntary control|255375007|31509003
of these muscles.|91727004

Others|74964007
claim
that puborectalis|61495006|244962004
can
become
hypertrophied|56246009
(enlarged|260376009|118452000
)
or
fibrosis|263756000
(replacement|3137001|282089006
of muscle tissue|91727004
with a more fibrous tissue|242762006|34433006
)
,
which
reduces|260400001
voluntary control|255375007|31509003
over the muscle.|91727004

Anismus|83605009
could
be
thought|88952004
of
as
the patient "forgetting"|116154003
how
to push correctly,|420620005
i.e.|42146005|22971001

straining|102548001
against a contracted pelvic floor,|78558002|87770006|78558002|361300007
instead of increasing abdominal cavity pressures|51590001|52731004|51590001|361294009|285665007|52731004|285665007|361294009
and
lowering pelvic cavity pressures.|261122009|21844003|279046003|261122009|21844003|13543005|261122009|281903009|279046003|261122009|281903009|13543005

It
may
be
that
this scenario
develops
as a result|394617004
of stress.|262188008

For example,
one study|421379005|110465008|421379005|224699009
reported|229059009|223458004
that animus
was
strongly
associated|47429007
with sexual abuse|213017001
in women.|224526002

One paper|421379005|50833004
stated|398070004
that events|272379006
such as pregnancy,|289908002
childbirth,|3950001|118215003|169836001|386216000
gynaecological descent|394586005
or
neurogenic disturbances
of the brain-bowel axis|12738006|261093006|39976000|12738006|261093006|388282002|258335003|261093006|39976000|258335003|261093006|388282002
could
lead|88488004
to a "functional obstructed defecation syndrome"|40143009|263821009|111989001|246464006|263821009|111989001
(
including|55919000
anismus|83605009
).

Anismus|83605009
may
develop
in persons|125676002
with extrapyramidal motor disturbance
due to Parkinson's disease.|49049000

This
represents
a type|261664005
of focal dystonia.|445006008

Anismus|83605009
may
also
occur|272120004
with anorectal malformation,|33225004
rectocele,|447072005
[19] rectal prolapse[20]|57773001
and
rectal ulcer.[20]|54609002

In many cases however,|398241000|413769002
the underlying pathophysiology|386585008
in patients|116154003
presenting|246105001
with obstructed defecation|263821009|111989001
cannot
be
determined.[21]

Some authors|308004006
have
commented
that
the "puborectalis paradox"|61495006|27699000|244962004|27699000
and
"spastic pelvic floor" concepts|263875003|87770006|263875003|361300007
have
no objective data to|410518001|260224007
support|9096001|243114000
their validity.

They
state|398070004
that "new evidence|7147002|18669006
showing
that defecation|111989001
is
an integrated process|415178003
of colonic|263977005
and
rectal emptying|255582007|69251000|69251000
suggests
that anismus|83605009
may
be
much more complex|242762006|103360007|4757001|103360007
than a simple disorder|13673007|64572001
of the pelvic floor muscles."|87770006|91727004|361300007|91727004
[21]

Persistent failure|76797004
to fully
evacuate
stool|39477002
may
lead|88488004
to retention|36850000
of a mass|300848003|118538004
of stool|39477002
in the rectum|34402009|181261002
(fecal loading|39477002
)
,
which
can
become
hardened,|19730000
forming|35810008
a fecal impaction|44635007
or
even fecoliths.

Liquid stool elements|398212009|57795002
may
leak|87952002
around the retained fecal mass,|397909002|39477002|300848003|397909002|39477002|118538004
which
may
lead|88488004
to paradoxical diarrhoea|27699000|398032003
and/or
fecal leakage|39477002|76676007
(usually
known|36692007
as encopresis|302752001|302690004
in children|410601007|160499008
and
fecal leakage|39477002|76676007
in adults|133936004
).[22][23][24][25]|264657009

When
anismus|83605009
occurs|272120004
in the context|263491009
of intractable encopresis|20646008|302752001|20646008|302690004
(
as
it often|70232002
does
)
,
resolution
of anismus|83605009
may
be
insufficient to|71978007|423437008
resolve
encopresis.|302752001|302690004

For this reason,|410666004
and
because
biofeedback|28150003|61334006
training|118629009
is
invasive, expensive,|10179008
and
labor|289909005|261041009
intensive, biofeedback training|28150003|118629009|61334006|118629009
is
not
recommended
for treatment|276239002|416118004
of encopresis|302752001|302690004
with anismus.|83605009

The walls|224727009
of the rectum|34402009|181261002
may
become
stretched,|386781001|122546009

as megarectum.[27]|33995003

The Rome classification diagnostic criteria|73504009|439401001|73504009|261004008
for functional defecation disorders|386585008|111989001
is
as
follows|367409002
:
[4]|260308009

The diagnostic criteria|439401001|261004008
for dyssynergic defecation|20262006|111989001
is
given|419582001
as "inappropriate contraction|78558002
of the pelvic floor|87770006|361300007

with adequate propulsive forces|51117008|88323005
during attempted defecation."|111989001
[4]|260308009

The diagnostic criteria|439401001|261004008
for inadequate defecatory Propulsion|71978007
is
given|419582001
as "inadequate propulsive forces|71978007

than 20% relaxation
of the anal sphincter|41178004|245453000
during attempted defecation."|111989001
[4]|260308009

The Rome criteria
recommend
that anorectal testing|272393004
is
not usually
indicated|410535002
in patients|116154003
with symptoms
of
until
patients|116154003
have
failed conservative treatment|276239002|416118004
(
e.g.
,
increased|35105006|260366006
dietary fiber|116272000
and
liquids|33463005
; elimination|63911002
of medications|410942007
with constipating side effects|14760008
whenever
possible|371930009|60022001
).

Various investigations|256220008|386053000
have
been
recommended
in the diagnosis|439401001
of anisumus.

Physical examination|5880005
can
rule|10828004
out anismus|255529000|83605009
(
by identifying|7882003
another cause|134198009
)
but
is
not sufficient to|51117008
diagnose|439401001
anismus.|83605009

defecating proctogram,|241170009
and
MRI defecography|113091000

The rectal cooling test|255582007|269814003|255582007|255582007|272393004|269814003|272393004
is
suggested to
differentiate|263933003
between rectal inertia|255582007
and
impaired relaxation/paradoxical contraction [28]|260379002|102546002|40226000|102546002

Other techniques|74964007|272394005
include|55919000
manometry,
balloon expulsion test,|438216009
evacuation proctography|122461007
(
see|281004000
defecating proctogram,|241170009
and
MRI defecography.|113091000

Diagnostic criteria|439401001|261004008
are
:
fulfillment
of criteria
for functional constipation,|197118003
manometric
and/or
EMG|42803009
and/or
radiological evidence|394914008|18669006|18669006|363680008|18669006
(2
out of 3|260313008
)
,
evidence|18669006
of adequate expulsion force,|51117008|118636005|51117008|118636005|285653008|88323005|118636005|88323005|118636005|285653008
and
evidence|18669006
of incomplete evacuation.|255599008|122461007|255609007|122461007

Recent dynamic imaging studies|6493001|229027002|363679005|110465008|6493001|229027002|363679005|224699009|6493001|229027002|278395004|110465008|6493001|229027002|278395004|224699009
have
shown
that
in persons|125676002
diagnosed|439401001
with anismus|83605009
the anorectal angle|1483009
during attempted defecation|111989001
is
abnormal,|263654008
and
this
is
due to abnormal|263654008
(paradoxical|27699000
)
movement|255324009
of the puborectalis muscle.[30][31][32]|61495006|264664006

Initial steps to|884001|398298007|232714002|398298007
alleviate
anismus|83605009
include|55919000
dietary adjustments|41829006|410616005|41829006|410617001
and
simple adjustments|13673007|410616005|13673007|410617001
when
attempting
to defecate.

Supplementation
with a bulking agent|260872001
such as psyllium 3500 mg|52370008|427264006
per day|258703001|259032004
will
make
stool more bulky,|271841006
which
decreases|260370003
the effort|19487008
required
to
evacuate.

Similarly,
exercise|61686008
and
adequate hydration|51117008|405006006|88323005|405006006
may
help
to
optimise
stool form.|39477002|246176004

The anorectal angle|1483009
has
been
shown
to flatten out
when
in a squatting position,|282961006|246449006
and
is
thus
recommended
for patients|116154003
with functional outlet obstruction|40143009|26036001|246464006|26036001
like anismus.|83605009

If
the patient|116154003
is
unable to|371151008
assume
a squatting postures|282961006|363855006
due to mobility issues,|363803005|55607006|246197003|55607006
a low stool|62482003|39477002|371880002|39477002
can
be
used|394850002
to
raise|260399008
the feet|56459004|259051005
when
sitting,|33586001
which effectively
achieves
a similar position.|246449006

Treatments|276239002
for anismus|83605009
include|55919000
biofeedback retraining,|28150003|61334006
botox injections,|404909007|28289002|404909007|129326001
and
surgical resection.|118292001|128303001

Anismus sometimes|83605009
occurs|272120004
together with other|74964007
conditions|78326006|260905004
that limit|255469002

of treatments.|276239002

Thus,
thorough evaluation|386053000
is
recommended
prior to treatment.[33]|276239002|264667004|416118004|264667004

Biofeedback training|28150003|118629009|61334006|118629009
for treatment|276239002|416118004
of anismus|83605009
is
highly effective|75540009|255403003|75540009|254648000
and
considered
the gold standard therapy|2309006|276239002|371256005|276239002
by many.|260396001

Others however,|74964007
reported|229059009|223458004
that biofeedback|28150003|61334006
had
a limited therapeutic effect.[36]|255469002|262202000|253861007

Injections|28289002|129326001
of botulin toxin type-A|427412002
into the puborectalis muscle|61495006
are
very effective|260358002|255403003|260358002|254648000
in the short term,
and
somewhat effective|255403003|254648000
in the long term.

Injections|28289002|129326001
may
be
helpful
when
used|394850002
together with biofeedback training.[38][39]|28150003|118629009|264670000|61334006|118629009|264670000

Historically,
