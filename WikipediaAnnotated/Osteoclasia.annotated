(
from the Greek words|1451003|255373000
for "bone"|272673000|3138006|90780006|128530007
(????
)
and
"

"
(???????
)
)
is
a type|261664005
of bone cell|23821005|3400000
that
removes|127485006
bone tissue|3138006
by removing|127485006
its mineralized matrix
and
breaking
up the organic bone|272673000|3138006|90780006|128530007
(organic dry weight|445541000
is
90% collagen.|264705001|61472002|264703008|61472002

This process|415178003
is
known|36692007
as
_bone resorption_.|22200009

Osteoclasts|27770000
were
discovered
by Kolliker
in 1873.

Osteoclasts|27770000
and
osteoblasts|48156001
are
instrumental
in controlling|54776003|31509003
the amount|107651007
of bone tissue|3138006
:
osteoblasts|48156001
form|246176004
bone,|272673000|3138006|90780006|128530007
osteoclasts|27770000
resorb
bone.|272673000|3138006|90780006|128530007

Osteoclasts|27770000
are
formed|35810008
by the fusion|31883006|122501008
of cells|4421005
of the monocyte-macrophage cell line.|35907002|58986001|50009006

Osteoclasts|27770000
are
characterized
by high expression|75540009|10012005|371879000|10012005
of tartrate resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP)|259298008
and
cathepsin K.|130668008

An osteoclast|27770000
is
a large cell|255509001|4421005|255509001|362837007
that
is
40 micrometer|259031006|258674000
in diameter.|81827009

It
contains|42504009
15-20 closely packed oval-shaped nuclei.|53999001|107644003|84640000|53999001|300842002|84640000

Osteoclasts|27770000
are
found|404684003
in pits|79261008
in the bone surface|272673000|410678000|3138006|410678000|90780006|410678000|128530007|410678000
which
are
called
resorption bays,|21024008
or
*
*Howship's Lacunae
*
*.

Osteoclasts|27770000
are
characterized
by a cytoplasm
with a homogeneous, "foamy" appearance.|421166008|386548000|421166008|255412001

This appearance|386548000|255412001
is
due to a high concentration|75540009|82742001|371879000|82742001
of vesicles|82515000
and
vacuoles.

These vacuoles
are
lysosomes|52971004
filled
with acid phophatase.|34957004

Osteoclast rough endoplasmic reticulum|27770000|24155001
is
sparse,
and
the Golgi complex|65251009
is
extensive.[3][4][5]|41118005

At a site|10546003
of active bone resorption,|55561003|22200009
the osteoclast|27770000
forms|246176004
a specialized cell membrane,|67995009|53982002|53982002
the "ruffled border,|112233002
"
that
touches|386476006|52962008|397624008
the surface|410678000
of the bone tissue.|3138006

The ruffled border,|112233002
which
facilitates
removal|118292001|128303001
of the bony matrix,|45001002
is
a morphologic characteristic|116676008|72724002
of an osteoclast|27770000
that
is
actively
resorbing
bone.|272673000|3138006|90780006|128530007

The ruffled border|112233002
increases|260366006
surface area interface|410678000|42798000
for bone resorption.|22200009

The mineral portion|87918000|260726005
of the matrix
(called hydroxyapatite|425874004
includes|55919000
calcium|5540006
and
phosphate ions.|350576006

These ions|48006008
are
absorbed
into small vesicles|255507004|82515000
(
see|281004000
endocytosis,
which
move|302000008|384598002|370125004
across the cell|4421005|362837007
and
eventually
are
released|68776005|129299003
into the extracellular fluid,|55450009
thus increasing levels|260369004|258395000
of the ions|48006008
in the blood.|87612001|119273009

Since
their discovery
in 1873 there
has
been
considerable debate
about their origin.|255395001

Three theories|421291004
were
dominant
:
from 1949
to 1970
the connective tissue origin|181769001|255395001
was
popular,
which
stated|398070004
that osteoclasts|27770000
and
osteoblasts|48156001
are
of the same lineage,|262126009
and
ostoblasts
fuse
together to
form|246176004
osteoclasts.|27770000

At certain|17162000
times osteoclasts|27770000
dissociate
into osteoblasts,|48156001
which finally
form|246176004
osteocytes.|23821005

In the 1970s
the biphyletic theory
became
popular
;
it
states|398070004
that osteoblasts|48156001
and
osteoclasts|27770000
are
of different lineage.|263735002

It
was
in the beginning|255395001
of 1980
that
the monocyte phagocytic system|55918008|246333005
was
recognized
as precursor
of osteoclasts.|27770000

Osteoclast formation|27770000|11798007|27770000|255277001
requires
the presence|386397008
of RANKL
(receptor activator|116647005
of nuclear factor ??|84640000
)
and
M-CSF|24357000
(Macrophage colony-stimulating factor|24357000
).

These membrane bound proteins|83097008|304372009
are
produced
by neighbouring stromal cells|40415009|4421005
and
osteoblasts,|48156001
thus
requiring
direct contact|255589003|11723008|255589003|70862002
between these cells|4421005
and
osteoclast precursors.|27770000

M-CSF|24357000
acts
through its receptor|116647005
on the osteoclast,|27770000
c-fms
(colony-stimulating factor 1 receptor|103164006
)
,
a transmembrane tyrosine kinase-receptor,|43305003|116647005
leading|236874000
to secondary messenger activation|2603003|40838000|81170007|40838000
of tyrosine kinase Src.|43305003

Both
of these molecules|290005005
are
necessary
for osteoclastogenesis
and
are
widely
involved|248448006
in the differentiation
of monocyte/macrophage derived cells.|35907002|58986001

RANKL
is
a member|394852005
of the tumour necrosis family|34823008|35359004
(TNF,
and
is
essential|34325006
in osteoclastogenesis.

RANKL knockout mice|282750008|447612001|282750008|447482001
exhibit
a phenotype|8116006|363778006
of osteopetrosis|1926006
and
defects|6920004
of tooth eruption,|397797004
along
with an absence|2667000|418560003
or
deficiency|260372006|248325000
of osteoclasts.|27770000

RANKL
activates
NF-??
(nuclear factor-??|84640000
)
and
NFATc1
(nuclear factor|84640000
of activated t cells,|57184004
cytoplasmic,
calcineurin-dependent 1|371154000
)
through RANK.|263486008

NF-??
activation
is
stimulated almost immediately|49499008
after
RANKL-RANK interaction|263486008
occurs|272120004
,
and
is
not
upregulated.

NFATc1 stimulation,|122545008
however,
begins|255395001
~24?48 hours|123027009|259029002
after binding|257768005
occurs|272120004
and
its expression|10012005
has
been
shown
to
be
RANKL
dependent.|371154000

Osteoclast differentiation|27770000
is
inhibited|61511001
by osteoprotegerin (OPG),
which
is
produced
by osteoblasts|48156001
and
binds|257768005
to RANKL thereby
preventing|116699007
interaction
with RANK.|263486008

Once
activated
,
osteoclasts|27770000
move|302000008|384598002|370125004
to areas|42798000
of microfracture|110398004
in the bone|272673000|3138006|90780006|128530007
by chemotaxis.|36922004

Osteoclasts|27770000
lie|40199007|255576009
in a small cavity|255507004|80967001|255507004|91806002|255507004|2483006
called
*
*Howship's lacunae
*
*,
formed|35810008
from the digestion|106079008
of the underlying bone.|272673000|3138006|90780006|128530007

The
*
*sealing zone|278420002
*
*
is
the attachment|1431002
of the osteoclast's plasma membrane|27770000|53982002
to the underlying bone.|272673000|3138006|90780006|128530007

Sealing zones|278420002
are
bounded|75958009|257768005|418131003
by belts|74094004
of specialized adhesion|67995009|42685002|42685002
structures
called podosomes.

Attachment|1431002
to the bone matrix|45001002
is
facilitated
by integrin receptors,|116647005
such as ?
v?
3,
via the specific amino acid motif Arg-Gly-Asp|69658003|52518006|15331006
in bone matrix proteins,|45001002|88878007
such as osteopontin.|102673007

The osteoclast|27770000
releases|115956009
hydrogen ions|89177007
through the action|129264002
of carbonic anhydrase|85717001
(H2O + CO2 ? HCO3- + H+|421982008|68615006|89177007|421982008|68615006|258322007|421982008|68615006|286551008|421982008|88645003|89177007|421982008|88645003|258322007|421982008|88645003|286551008|38007001|68615006|89177007|38007001|68615006|258322007|38007001|68615006|286551008|38007001|88645003|89177007|38007001|88645003|258322007|38007001|88645003|286551008
)
through the
*
*ruffled border|112233002
*
*
into the resorptive cavity,|80967001|91806002|2483006
acidifying
and
aiding dissolution|62479008|246088000
of the mineralized bone matrix|45001002
into Ca2+,
H3PO4,
H2CO3,
water|11713004|119318008
and
other substances.|74964007|105590001

Dysfunction|386585008
of the carbonic anhydrase|85717001
has
been
documented|397934002
to
cause|23981006|134198009
some forms|246176004
of osteopetrosis.|1926006

Hydrogen ions|89177007
are
pumped|44668000
against a high concentration gradient|75540009|82742001|272077000|371879000|82742001|272077000
by proton pumps,|89177007|44668000
specifically
a unique vacuolar-ATPase.|38854003

This enzyme|90668006
has
been
targeted
in the prevention|169443000
of osteoporosis.|64859006

In addition,|260364009
several hydrolytic enzymes,|261028005|90668006
such as members|394852005
of the cathepsin|299977009
and
matrix metalloprotease|130355006
(MMP
)
groups,|261586004|160481000
are
released|68776005|129299003
to
digest
the organic components|246093002
of the matrix.

These enzymes|90668006
are
released|68776005|129299003
into the compartment
by lysosomes.|52971004

Of these hydrolytic enzymes,|90668006
cathepsin K|130668008
is
of most importance.

Cathepsin K|130668008
is
a collagenolytic, papain-like, cysteine protease|6320008|19298006
that
is
mainly
expressed
in osteoclasts,|27770000
and
is
secreted
into the resorptive pit.|79261008

Cathepsin K|130668008
is
the major protease|255603008|116536008
involved|248448006
in the degradation|40091007
of type I collagen|58520002
and
other noncollagenous proteins.|74964007|88878007

Mutations|55446002
in the cathepsin K gene|130668008|67271001
are
associated|47429007
with pycnodysostosis,|89647000
a hereditary osteopetrotic disease,|32895009
characterised
by lack|41277001
of functional cathepsin K expression.|40143009|130668008|10012005|246464006|130668008|10012005

Knockout|282750008
studies|110465008|224699009
of cathepsin K|130668008
in mice|447612001|447482001
lead|88488004
to an osteopetrotic phenotype,|8116006|363778006
which,
is
partially
compensated|17275008
by increased expression|35105006|10012005|260366006|10012005
of proteases|130202003|116536008
other|74964007
that cathepsin K|130668008
and
enhanced osteoclastogenesis.

Cathepsin K|130668008
has
an optimal enzymatic activity|90668006|48761009|90668006|55561003|90668006|258745004|90668006|257733005
in acidic conditions.|34957004|260905004

It
is
synthesized
as a proenzyme|102794000
with a molecular weight|290005005|27113001|290005005|272102008|290005005|39857003
of 37kDa,
and
upon activation
by autocatalytic cleavage,|23365005
is
transformed
into the mature, active form|34071009|55561003|246176004
with a molecular weight|290005005|27113001|290005005|272102008|290005005|39857003
of ~27kDa.

Upon polarization
of the osteoclast|27770000
over the site|10546003
of resorption,
cathepsin K|130668008
is
secreted
from the
*
*ruffled border|112233002
*
*
into the
*
*resorptive pit|79261008
*
*.

Cathepsin K|130668008
transmigrates
across the ruffled border|112233002
by intercellular vesicles|82515000
and
is
then
released|68776005|129299003
by the functional|40143009|246464006
*
*secretory domain|46242002
*
*.

Within these intercellular vesicles,|82515000
cathepsin K,|130668008
along
with reactive oxygen species|11214006|24099007|69658003
generated
by TRAP,|403833009
further|46053002
degrades
the bone extracellular matrix.|45001002|69320009

Numerous other cathepsins|260396001|299977009
are
expressed
in osteoclasts.|27770000

These
include|55919000
cathepsin B,|32157002
C,
D,|876000
E,
G,|258795003
and
L.|258995007|420559008

The function|246464006
of these cysteine|5932006
and
aspartic proteases|130354005
is
generally
unknown|261665006
within bone,|272673000|3138006|90780006|128530007
and
they
are
expressed
at much lower levels|261122009|258395000
than cathepsin K.|130668008

Studies|110465008|224699009
on cathepsin L knockout mice|82160008|282750008|447612001|82160008|282750008|447482001
have
been
mixed|26242008
,
with a report|229059009|223458004
of reduced trabecular bone|260400001|20870005
in homozygous|22061001
and
heterozygous cathepsin L knockout mice|14556007|82160008|282750008|447612001|14556007|82160008|282750008|447482001
compared
to wild-type|262290003|261664005
and
another
report|229059009|223458004
finding|404684003
no skeletal abnormalities.|113192009|276654001

The matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs)|130355006
comprise
a family|35359004
of more|242762006
than 20 zinc-dependent endopeptidases.|86739005|371154000|116536008

The role
of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs)|130355006
in osteoclast biology|27770000|12893009
is
ill-defined,|367391008
but
in other tissue|74964007|85756007
they
have
been
linked
with tumor promoting activities,|108369006|257733005
such as activation
of growth factors|81286007
and
are
required
for tumor metastasis|128462008
and
angiogenesis.

It
is
expressed
by osteoclasts,|27770000
and
is
known to|36692007
be
required
for osteoclast migration|27770000|74118003
and
is
a powerful gelatinase.|33300005

Transgenic mice|447612001|447482001

*
*MMP-13
*
*
is
believed to
be
involved|248448006
in bone resorption|22200009
and
in osteoclast differentiation,|27770000
as
knockout mice|282750008|447612001|282750008|447482001
revealed|263857004

MMPs
expressed
by the osteoclast|27770000
include|55919000
MMP-9, -|130713004
10, -
12,
and -
14.

apart from MMP-9,|130713004
little|281411007|255507004
is
known|36692007
about their relevance
to the osteoclast,|27770000
however,
high levels|75540009|258395000|371879000|258395000
of MMP-14
are
found|404684003
at the sealing zone.|278420002

Osteoclasts|27770000
are
regulated
by several hormones,|261028005|87568004
including|55919000
parathyroid hormone (PTH)|4076007|428295002
from the parathyroid gland,|111002
calcitonin|63730009|127383000
from the thyroid gland,|69748006|181117000
and
growth factor interleukin 6 (IL-6).|81286007|30965005|81286007|22766004

This last hormone,|87568004
IL-6,|30965005
is
one|421379005
of the factors
in the disease osteoporosis,|64572001|64859006
which
is
an imbalance
between bone resorption|22200009
and
bone formation.|83323007

Osteoclast activity|27770000|48761009|27770000|55561003|27770000|258745004|27770000|257733005
is
also
mediated|73510009
by the interaction
of two molecules|420797005|290005005
produced
by osteoblasts,|48156001
namely osteoprotegerin
and
RANK ligand.|263486008

Note
that
these molecules also|290005005
regulate
differentiation
of the osteoclast.[6]|27770000

An osteoclast|27770000
can
also
be
an instrument|57134006
used|394850002
to
fracture|125605004
and
reset bones|272673000|128530007
(
the origin|255395001
is
Greek _osteon_|1451003|91729001
:
bone|272673000|3138006|90780006|128530007
and
_klastos_
:
broken
).

To
avoid
confusion,|286933003
the cell|4421005|362837007
was
originally termed osotoclast.

When
the surgical instrument|37759000
went
out of use,|277889008|419385000
the cell|4421005|362837007
became
known|36692007
by its present name.|52101004|246105001
