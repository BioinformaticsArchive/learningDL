*Pseudorabies|6462002
*
*
is
a viral disease|34014006
in swine|106996007|78678003
that
is
endemic
in most parts|260726005
of the world.

It
is
caused|23981006|134198009
by _Suid herpesvirus 1_ (SuHV-1),|67907007
which
is
also called pseudorabies virus (PRV)|67907007
and
is
also
known|36692007
as
*
*Aujeszky's disease|6462002
*
*,
and
in cattle
as
*
*mad itch|6462002
*
*.

PRV|109992005
is
considered to
be
the most economically important viral disease|4757001|34014006
of swine|106996007|78678003
in areas|42798000
where hog cholera|28044006
has
been
eradicated.

Other domestic|74964007|261770009
and
wild mammals,|262290003|387976007
such as cattle,
sheep,|388254009|255392003
goats,|125097000|388249000
cats,|448169003|388618001
dogs,|448771007
and
raccoons,|388594007
are
also susceptible.|131196009

The disease|64572001
is
usually fatal|399166001
in these hosts.[2]

Research
on PRV|109992005
in pigs|106996007|78678003
has
pioneered animal disease control|387961004|64572001|31509003
with genetically modified vaccines.|398827000|243326001|398827000

PRV|109992005
is
now extensively
studied|110465008|224699009
as a model
for basic processes|415178003|418836005|415178003
during lytic herpesvirus infection,|371757000|23513009|255308008|23513009
and
for unravelling molecular mechanisms|290005005|257544000
of herpesvirus neurotropism.[3][4]|128377001|314797000

The word "pseudorabies" means "false rabies,|255373000|6462002|255586005|64100000|14168008|255373000|6462002|255586005|64100000|396437008
"
or
"rabies-|14168008|396437008
like
;" pseudorabies|6462002
is
related|272151006|262094002
to the herpes virus,|128377001|314797000
not
the rabies virus.|59881000

The earliest reports|264499004|229059009|264499004|223458004
of a disease|64572001
suspected|415684004
to
be
pseudorabies|6462002
were
in 1813
in the United States.|223688001

These reports|229059009|223458004
described
a condition|260905004
in cattle
characterized
by severe itching|24484000|424492005
and
called "mad itch".|6462002

In 1902,
a Hungarian veterinarian, Alad?r Aujeszky,|297923001|106290006|24028007
isolated PRV|46651001|109992005
from a dog,|448771007
ox,|73169008
and
cat,|448169003|33384004|388626009
and
showed
it
caused|23981006|134198009
the same disease|262126009|64572001
in swine|106996007|78678003
and
rabbits.|88818001

The name "
pseudorabies|6462002
"
came
from the symptoms
similar
to rabies|14168008|396437008
that
it
caused|23981006|134198009
in rabbits.[5]|88818001

The virus|49872002
is
shed
in the saliva|256897009
and
nasal secretions|260540009|46242002|46242002
of infected swine|106996007|78678003
and
is
spread|410677005
through oral|260548002
or
nasal contact.|260540009|11723008|260540009|70862002|11723008|70862002

Aerosolization
of the virus|49872002
and
transmission|258150004
by fomites also
may
occur.|272120004

The virus|49872002
may
potentially
survive
for seven hours|420359007|258702006
in humid air|17461003|417696007
and
spread|410677005
up to two kilometers.|420797005|258670009

Furthermore,
it
may
survive
on well water|20572008|11713004|20572008|119318008
for
up to seven hours,|420359007|258702006
in green grass,|371246006|422304003
soil,|415555003
and
feces|39477002
for
up to two days,|420797005|258703001
in contaminated feed|62604006|129007004
for
up to three days,|421291004|258703001
and
in straw bedding
for
up to four days.[6]|421534005|258703001

Diagnosis|439401001
is
made
through an ELISA test.|76978006|269814003|76978006|76978006|272393004

Vaccines|398827000
are
available|103328004
for swine|106996007|78678003
(ATCvet codes
:

There
are
eradication
programs
in the United States|223688001
and
the United Kingdom.|223860005

In 2004
the commercial swine population|106996007|385436007|106996007|389109008|78678003|385436007|78678003|389109008
of the United States|223688001
was
declared
free|37837009
of pseudorabies,|6462002
but
the disease|64572001
remained
in feral pig populations.[8]|78678003|385436007

Swine|106996007|78678003
are
usually asymptomatic,|84387000
but
PRV|109992005
can
cause|23981006|134198009
abortion,|70317007|386639001
high mortality|75540009|409651001|371879000|409651001

Mortality|409651001
in piglets less
than one month|421379005|258706009|421379005|259036001
of age|424144002
is
close|29179001
to 100%,

it
is
less
than 10%
in pigs|106996007|78678003
between one|421379005
and
six months|422218008|258706009
of age.|424144002

Pregnant swine|77386006|106996007|77386006|78678003|127362006|106996007|127362006|78678003
can
reabsorb
their litters|370553007
or
deliver
mummified
,
stillborn,
or
weakened piglets.

In cattle,
symptoms
include|55919000
intense itching|103370009|424492005
followed|367409002
by neurological signs|1199008|72670004
and
death.|419620001|268923008

In dogs,|448771007
symptoms
include|55919000
intense itching,|103370009|424492005
jaw|661005|181811001
and
pharyngeal paralysis,|81624004

and
death.|419620001|268923008

In cats,|448169003|388618001
the disease|64572001
is
so rapidly fatal, usually|223528007|418694008|399166001
no symptoms
are
noted.

Any infected secondary host generally only|2603003|81170007
lives|224130005
two|420797005
to three days.[6]|421291004|258703001

Populations|385436007
of wild boar,|78678003
or
feral hogs
(_Sus scrofa_|78678003
)
,
in the
US commonly
contract|78558002
and
spread|410677005
the virus|49872002
throughout their range.

Mortality|409651001
is
highest|75540009|371879000
in young piglets.|84422007

Pregnant sows often|77386006|70232002|127362006|70232002
abort
when
infected.

Otherwise healthy male adults|102513008
(boars|106996007
)
are
typically latent carriers,|44104002|47461006
that
is
,
they
harbor|257621007
and
transmit|60117003
the virus|49872002
without displaying symptoms
or
suffering disability.[10]|21134002

Swine|106996007|78678003
(
both
domestic|261770009
and
feral
)
are
usual reservoirs|257687008
for this virus,|49872002
though
it
does
affect|4065008
other species,|74964007|69658003
often|70232002
with high mortality.|75540009|409651001|371879000|409651001

Pseudorabies|6462002
has
been
reported|229059009|223458004
in other mammals,|74964007|387976007
including|55919000
brown bears,|76305000
and
black bears,|315240009|106970005|413464008|106970005|15086000|106970005|371252007|106970005
Florida panthers,|224048003
raccoons,|388594007

In most cases,|398241000|413769002
contact|11723008|70862002
with pigs|106996007|78678003

pig products|78678003|388393002|388392007
was
either
known|36692007

suspected.|415684004

Outbreaks|443684005
in farm fur species|224816003|29292008|69658003
in Europe|223502009
(mink

Many other species|74964007|69658003
can
be
experimentally
infected.

Humans|278412004
are
not potential hosts.[11]|30207005

Pseudorabies|6462002
is
highly contagious.|75540009

In most cases,|398241000|413769002
this disease|64572001
is
transmitted|60117003|258150004
through nose-to-nose contact,|260540009|11723008|260540009|70862002|181195007|11723008|181195007|70862002
which
is
the most common type|4757001|72906007|261664005
of transmission|258150004
because
the virus|49872002
is
mostly
present|52101004|246105001
in nasal|260540009
and
oral areas.|260548002|42798000

This disease|64572001
can
wipe
out entire herds.|255529000|255503000|418788006|255529000|260232004|418788006

Although
no specific treatment|69658003|276239002|69658003|416118004
for acute infection|63171007
with pseudorabies virus|67907007
is
available, vaccination|103328004
can
alleviate
clinical signs|58147004|72670004
in pigs|106996007|78678003
of certain ages.|17162000|424144002

Typically,
mass vaccination|300848003|118538004
of all pigs|106996007|78678003
on the farm|224816003
with a modified live virus vaccine|419749002|37362000|243326001|419749002|37362000
is
recommended.

Intranasal vaccination|260617000
of sows
and
neonatal piglets|255407002
one|421379005
to seven days old,|420359007|258703001|70753007
followed|367409002
by intramuscular (IM) vaccination|76601001|255559005
of all other swine|74964007|106996007|74964007|78678003
on the premises,
helps
reduce|260400001
viral shedding
and
improve|385425000|3442003|385633008
survival.

The modified live virus|419749002|49872002|419749002|243326001|419749002|49872002|243326001|419749002
replicates|1305003
at the site|10546003
of injection|28289002|385218009|129326001
and
in regional lymph nodes.|410673009|59441001|255470001|59441001

Vaccine virus|37362000
is
shed
in such low levels,|62482003|258395000|371880002|258395000
mucous transmission|49909006|258150004|255433005|258150004
to other animals|74964007|387961004
is
minimal.|255605001|255604002

In gene-deleted vaccines,|67271001|398827000
the thymidine kinase gene|61588000|67271001
has
also
been
deleted
;
thus,
the virus|49872002
cannot
infect
and
replicate|1305003|27582007
in neurons.|47220008

Breeding herds|418788006
are
recommended
to
be
vaccinated
quarterly,|3015006
and
finisher pigs|106996007|78678003
should
be
vaccinated
after levels|258395000
of maternal antibody decrease.|312313001|260400001|312313001|260370003

Regular vaccination|17854005
results|394617004
in excellent control|425405005|31509003
of the disease.|64572001

Concurrent antibiotic therapy|68405009|281789004
via feed|129007004
and
IM injection|76601001
is
recommended
for controlling secondary bacterial pathogens.|54776003|2603003|409822003|264418008|54776003|81170007|409822003|264418008|31509003|2603003|409822003|264418008|31509003|81170007|409822003|264418008
