*
(also
called
"
*
*sweat rash|63951004|72658003
*
*"[1]|260305007
or
"
*
*prickly heat|72658003

*"
)
is
a skin disease|95320005
marked|46998006
by small|255507004
and
itchy rashes.|64144002

Miliaria|63951004
is
a common ailment|72906007|39104002
in hot|264018002
and
humid conditions,|17461003|260905004
such as
in the tropics
and
during the summer season.|21864008

Although
it
affects|4065008
people|125676002
of all ages,|424144002
it
is
especially common|72906007
in children|410601007|160499008
and
infants|418119000
due to their underdeveloped sweat glands.|10410005

Miliaria|63951004
can
be
classified|73504009
according to the top level|421812003|258395000|421812003|276625007
at which obstruction|26036001
occurs|272120004
in the sweat glands.|10410005

The most superficial obstruction|4757001|26283006|26036001
(
with the most mild clinical presentation|4757001|255604002|58147004|246105001
)
,
is
known|36692007
as
*
*miliaria|63951004
crystalline|264297004
*
*
;
instead of a rash|271807003
the patient|116154003
presents|52101004|246105001
with multiple tiny blister-|260396001|408764000|260396001|247464001|260396001|417237009
like lesions
that
look|386548000
like beads
of perspiration|74616000|161857006
and
essentially
cause|23981006|134198009
no symptoms.[2]
:
23[3]|264657009

The most commonly encountered form|4757001|246176004
of the illness|39104002
is
*
*miliaria rubra|72658003
*
*,
in which obstruction|26036001
causes|134198009
leakage|76676007
of sweat|74616000|161857006
into the deeper layers|131197000
of the epidermis,|55988001
provoking|410658008
a local inflammatory reaction|255470001|257552002
giving|419582001
rise
to the typical appearance|386548000|255412001
of redness|386713009|371240000
(hence rubra
)
and
larger|255509001|263768009
(
but
still only
a few millimetres|57176003|258673006
)
blister-|408764000|247464001|417237009
like lesions.

This form|246176004
of the illness|39104002
is
often|70232002
accompanied
by the typical symptoms - intense itching|103370009|424492005
or
"pins|77444004
and
needles"|79068005
with a lack|41277001
of sweating|161857006
(anhidrosis|39659002
)
to affected areas.|247591002|42798000|248448006|42798000

There
is
a small risk|255507004|30207005
of heat exhaustion|95868006
due to inability to
sweat|74616000|161857006
if
the rash|271807003
affects|4065008
a large proportion|255509001|8212001
of the body's surface area|301898006
or
the sufferer
continues|255238004
to engage|54986009
in heat-producing activity.|88999006|48761009|88999006|55561003|88999006|258745004|88999006|257733005

The most severe form|4757001|24484000|246176004
of miliaria,|63951004
*
*miliaria profunda|47317002
*
*,
sometimes
referred|439980006
to
as
"wildfire"|46459009
due to the rapid spread|255358001|410677005
and
severe burning sensations,|24484000|90673000
generally
occurs|272120004
as a complication|116223007|263718001
of repeated episodes|27582007|272128006
of miliaria rubra.|72658003

The obstruction|26036001
is
located deep|131197000
in the structure
of the sweat gland,|10410005
causing|23981006
the gland's secretions to|362884007|46242002
leak|87952002
between the superficial|26283006
and
deep layers|131197000
of the skin.|119325001|39937001|181469002

The rash,|271807003
and
associated symptoms,|102483000
tend
to break out
within hours|258702006
of an activity provoking sweating|48761009|410658008|161857006|55561003|410658008|161857006|258745004|410658008|161857006|257733005|410658008|161857006
but
similarly
fade
within hours|258702006
when
the stimulus|8927009
for the sweating|161857006
is
removed.|127485006

The rash|271807003
tends
to
be
flesh-coloured|103366001
as
opposed
to the prominent redness|4657009|386713009|4657009|371240000
of miliaria rubra,|72658003
and
the risk|30207005
of heat exhaustion|95868006
is
larger.|255509001|263768009

Miliaria pustulosa|26988005
describes
pustules|271760008
due to inflammation|257552002
and
bacterial infection.|301811001

Symptoms
of miliaria|63951004
include|55919000
small red rashes,|255507004|386713009|271807003|255507004|371240000|271807003
called papules,|443871003
which
may
itch|424492005
or
more often|242762006|70232002
cause|23981006|134198009
an intense 'pins-|103370009|77444004
and-
needles' prickling sensation._[citation|79068005|255354004
needed|410525008|103325001
_]
These
may
simultaneously|79970003
occur|272120004
at a number|410680006|410681005
of areas|42798000
on a sufferer's body,|279495008|123037004
the most common|4757001|72906007
including|55919000
the face,|89545001|302549007
neck,|45048000|302550007
under the breasts|76752008
and
under the scrotum.|264191007|265794003

Other areas|74964007|42798000
include|55919000
skin folds,|119325001|26310004|39937001|26310004|181469002|26310004
areas|42798000
of the body|279495008|123037004
that
may
rub
against clothing,|272180002
such as the back,|123961009|255551008|281213008|302552004|77568009
chest,|261179002
and
stomach,|69695003|181246003
etc.

A related|272151006|262094002
and
sometimes simultaneous condition|79970003|260905004
is
folliculitis,|13600006
where hair follicles|67290009
become
plugged|303480007
with foreign matter,
resulting|42752001
in inflammation.|257552002

The symptoms
relating|272151006|262094002
to miliaria|63951004
should
not
be
confused|286933003
with shingles|4740000
as
they
can
be
very similar.|260358002

Shingles|4740000
will
restrict|263856008
itself to
one|421379005
side|182353008
of the body|279495008|123037004
but
also
has
a rash-|271807003
like appearance.|386548000|255412001

It
is
also
accompanied
by a prickling sensation|255354004
and
pain|22253000
throughout the region.|410673009

Those
who
suspect|415684004
they
have
shingles|4740000
and
not miliaria|63951004
should
seek
medical advice immediately|74188005|420227002|49499008
as the sooner antivirals|372701006
are
taken|419652001
,
the better.|3442003

Miliaria|63951004
occurs|272120004
when
the sweat gland ducts|28600009
get
plugged|303480007
due to dead skin cells|419620001|314819008
or
bacteria|409822003
such as _Staphylococcus epidermidis_,|60875001
[4]|260308009
a common bacterium|72906007|409822003
that
occurs|272120004
on the skin|119325001|39937001|181469002
which
is
also
associated|47429007
with acne.|88616000|11381005

The trapped sweat|403833009|74616000|403833009|161857006
leads|88488004|236874000
to irritation|257553007
(prickling|255354004
)
,
itching|424492005
and
to a rash|271807003
of very small blisters,|260358002|255507004|408764000|260358002|255507004|247464001
usually
in a localized area|255471002|42798000
of the skin.|119325001|39937001|181469002

Prickly heat|72658003
can
be
prevented|116699007
by avoiding activities|257733005
that
induce|16404004
sweating,|161857006
using|260676000
air conditioning to|417696007|78326006
cool
the environment,|276339004
[5] wearing light clothing|264706000|56242006|272180002|264706000|371268001|272180002|264605009|56242006|272180002|264605009|371268001|272180002
and
in general,|60132005
avoiding
hot|264018002
and
humid weather.|17461003

Frequent cool showers|70232002
or
cool baths
with mild soap|255604002|25780000
can
help
to
prevent
heat rash.|63951004|72658003

Medical assistance|74188005|116697009
should
be
sought
for the first episode|255217005
of a rash|271807003
with the appearance|386548000|255412001
of miliaria.|63951004

The differential diagnosis|47965005
includes|55919000
several conditions|261028005|260905004
which an experienced practitioner
should
be
able|371150009
to recognise
and
may
require
treatment|276239002|416118004
distinct
from the usual measures|246445000|367346004
taken|419652001
for miliaria.|63951004

In most cases|398241000|413769002
the rash|271807003
of miliaria|63951004
will
resolve
without intervention.|225334002

However,
severe cases|24484000|398241000|24484000|413769002
can
last
for a number|410680006|410681005
of weeks|258705008
and
cause|23981006|134198009
significant disability.|386134007|21134002

General measures|60132005|246445000|60132005|367346004
should
be
recommended
for all patients,|116154003
including|55919000
moving
to an air-conditioned environment|417696007|78326006|276339004
if
possible,|371930009|60022001
avoiding
sweat-provoking activities|74616000|257733005|161857006|257733005
and
occlusive clothing,|263823007|272180002
and
taking frequent cool showers.|419652001|70232002

It
has
been
suggested
that
the use|277889008|419385000
of topical antibacterials|419241000|359540000|419241000
(
including|55919000
the use|277889008|419385000
of antibacterial soaps|419241000|25780000
)
may
shorten|129350004|359530003
the duration|103335007
of symptoms
in miliaria rubra even|72658003
in the absence|2667000|418560003
of obvious superinfection.|193198003

Other topical agents|74964007|419487009
which
may
reduce|260400001
the severity|272141005
of symptoms
include|55919000
anti-itch preparations|424492005|225106003
such as calamine|387082008
or
menthol|387414008
or
camphor-based preparations,|412108007|225106003|412108007|418836005|225106003
and
topical steroid creams.|421628006|116566001

However,
caution
should
be
used|394850002
with oil-based preparations|21847005|225106003|21847005|418836005|225106003|421890007|225106003|421890007|418836005|225106003
(ointments|385101003
and
oily creams|42273000|255621006
as
opposed
to water|11713004|119318008
based|418836005
or
aqueous lotions|17519006
)
which
may
increase|260366006
blockage
to the sweat glands|10410005
and
prolong|255224006
duration|103335007
of illness.|39104002

Other agents|74964007|260872001
have
been
investigated|116698004
including|55919000
supplemental vitamin A|373453009|82622003|373453009
and
C
and
vitamin A based medications,|82622003|410942007|82622003|418836005|410942007|410942007|418836005|410942007
but
it
is
worth noting
that there
is
little scientific evidence|18669006
supporting|9096001|243114000
any
of the above treatments|261183002|276239002
in terms
of actually
reducing|260400001
the duration|103335007
of symptoms
or
frequency|260864003|272123002
of complications.|116223007

In most tropical areas|42798000
the local dispensaries|255470001
sell
Prickly Heat Powder,|72658003|85581007
a talc admixture containing drying milk proteins|409109009|42504009|257791009|10827009
(Labilin
)
and
Triclosan to|387054001
fight|248005005
the infection.

These
include|55919000
cooling menthol to|387414008
help
alleviate difficulty getting to|371157007
sleep.|258158006

This
is
an effective treatment ?|255403003|276239002|255403003|416118004|254648000|276239002|254648000|416118004
the powder stays|85581007
on the skin longer|119325001|255511005|39937001|255511005|181469002|255511005
and
treats|395077000
bacteria|409822003
dispersed|86902002
into bed linens,|229772003
providing
a reasonably
dry|13880007
refuge area|42798000
for healing.|298005009|90910008

Consider
that miliaria often|63951004|70232002
covers|255334000
large areas,|255509001|42798000
and
generous use|277889008|419385000
of Cortisone|32498003
may
be
contraindicated|410536001
for reasons|410666004
stated|398070004
on package warnings.

Regular talcum powder|17854005|409109009|17854005
will
not
reduce|260400001
the rash|271807003
but
can
alleviate
burning|90673000|62404004
and
itching.|424492005

In cases|398241000|413769002
where the rash|271807003
has
developed
into open blisters|56116003|408764000|56116003|247464001
or
pustular|255441005
lesions
a doctor|309343006
should
be
consulted|11429006
since more aggressive, medically monitored treatment|61372001|302805002|276239002|61372001|302805002|416118004|61372001|13288007|276239002|61372001|13288007|416118004|302805002|276239002|302805002|416118004|13288007|276239002|13288007|416118004
may
be
required.
