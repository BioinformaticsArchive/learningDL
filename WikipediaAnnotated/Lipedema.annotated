*Lipedema|234102003
*
*
is
a chronic disorder|27624003
of the adipose tissue generally|38888009
affecting|247591002|248448006
the legs,|30021000
which
causes|134198009
the legs,|30021000
and
sometims
the arms,|40983000
but
not
the feet,|56459004|259051005
to
accumulate
fatty tissue.|38888009

It
is
distinguishable
by five characteristics|421820001
:
1
)
it
can
be
inherited|255404009
;
2
)
it
occurs|272120004
almost exclusively
in women|224526002
;
3
)
it
can
occur|272120004
in women|224526002
of all sizes,|277049003
from the seriously
underweight|248342006
to the morbidly obese|414915002
;
4
)
it
involves|248448006
the excess deposit|260378005|46595003
and
expansion
of fat cells|24826007
in an unusual
and
particular pattern ? bilateral, symmetrical|272135003|51440002|18772005
and
usually
from the waist|33673004|243989000
to a distinct line just|50009006
above the ankles
;
and
5
)
unlike the typical fat|271590003
of obesity,|414915002
lipedemic fat generally|271590003
cannot
be
lost
through diet|41829006
and
exercise.|61686008

Surgery|83578000
is
highly controversial,|75540009
and
in many cases,|398241000|413769002
can
make
the condition worse._[citation|260905004|230993007|260905004|390772001|260905004|231877006

Lipedema usually|234102003
is
triggered|410658008
at puberty,|18991001
but
can
trigger|410658008
or
worsen|230993007|390772001
during
or
after pregnancy,|289908002
at peri-menopause,
and
following|255260001
gynecological surgery,|12658000
i.e.,|42146005|22971001
surgery|83578000
of the uterus,|35039007|181452004
ovaries,|15497006|83238006
or
fallopian tubes.|414982008

If lipedema|234102003
is
diagnosed early,|439401001|264499004
which currently|15240007
is
very rare,|260358002|84638005|260358002|103356009
it
is
possible to|371930009|60022001
prevent
a significant expansion|386134007
of lipedemic fat cells,|24826007
and
to
alert|248221007
patients|116154003
to their heightened risk|260365005|30207005|260366006|30207005
for obesity|414915002
so
they
can
take|419652001
appropriate action.|129264002

Estimates|414135002
of the incidence
of lipedema|234102003
vary
widely,
and
range
as high|75540009|371879000
as 11%
of the post-puberty female population.|419065006|248152002|385436007|419065006|248152002|389109008|419065006|224526002|385436007|419065006|224526002|389109008

The cause|134198009
is
unknown|261665006
,
although
most people|125676002
with lipedema|234102003
have
a significant hormonal imbalance.[1]|386134007|362969004

Patients|116154003
tend
to
gain|35105006|255396000|260366006|260369004|398092000
weight|27113001|272102008|39857003
in lipedemic areas|42798000
and
lose
it
in non-lipedemic areas,|42798000
though
there
are
cases|398241000|413769002
where weight loss|89362005
has
resulted|42752001|394617004
in improvement
of the condition.|260905004

Obese lipedema patients|414915002|234102003|116154003
who
undergo
bariatric surgery|83578000
lose
fat primarily|271590003
from the waist|33673004|243989000
up.

Symptoms
of lypedemia
include|55919000
disproportionately large, column-|255509001
like legs.|30021000

As lipedema progresses,|234102003|385651009
patients|116154003
become
increasingly heavy|410712002
in the lower body.|128263001

The additional,|260364009
expanding|70955005
fat cells|24826007
interfere|78235001
with the pathways
of lymphatic vessels,|83555006
and
patients|116154003
can
develop
secondary lymphedema,|28590005
a condition|260905004
known|36692007
as lipo-lymphedema.|234097001

Many lipedema patients|234102003|116154003
cannot
tolerate
the compression garments|71173004|272180002|263720003|272180002
associated|47429007
with conventional lymphedema treatment|255333006|234097001|276239002|255333006|234097001|416118004
because
the underlying lipedemic fat|271590003
is
very painful,|260358002|22253000
and
those patients therefore|116154003
are
at risk|410519009
for the side effects
of uncontrolled lymphedema,|19032002|234097001
including|55919000
recurring blood infections|246455001|87612001|246455001|119273009|255227004|87612001|255227004|119273009
and
fibrosis.|263756000

If
not
kept
in check|52101004|360160009|18720000|360160009
through a healthy lifestyle|263775005|60134006
the condition|260905004
can
worsen,|230993007|390772001
and
patients|116154003
will
become
progressively less mobile.

Treatment|276239002|416118004
is
designed primarily to
address|397635003
the secondary lymphedema part|28590005|260726005
of the lipedema patient?s condition.|234102003|116154003|260905004

This treatment|276239002|416118004
includes|55919000
a course|288524001
of manual lymphatic drainage|229487007
and
bandaging|182555002
by a lymphedema therapist,|234097001
followed|367409002
by the wearing
of custom-fitted compression garments|91175000|71173004|272180002|91175000|263720003|272180002
or
devices ? usually stockings|303607000|228184002|49062001|228184002
and
sometimes biker shorts.|228211007

Compression|71173004|263720003
prevents|116699007
recurrence|246455001
of lymphedema,|234097001
and
in some lipedema patients|234102003|116154003
can
reduce|260400001
the pain|22253000
of lipedemic fat.|271590003

There
is
currently|15240007
no known uniform procedure to|36692007|27617004|71388002
cure
lipedema.|234102003

It
is
,
however,
successfully
managed|119270007
through a variety
of consistently applied techniques to|410618006|272394005
improve|385425000|3442003|385633008
the health|263775005
of the legs|30021000
and
prevent
the condition|260905004
from
returning|7528007
in more difficult to|242762006|52925006
manage|119270007
levels.|258395000

Management|413454004|119270007
involves|248448006
reducing dietary sodium intake,|260400001|267110002
frequent,|70232002
gentle
exercise|61686008
to
promote
circulation|413854007
in the legs,|30021000
such as rebound exercise,|61686008
and
treatments|276239002
typical
for lymphedema treatment.|234097001|276239002|234097001|416118004

Although
first
identified|7882003
in the United States,|223688001
at the Mayo Clinic|223807006|35971002|223807006|257585005
in 1940,
lipedema|234102003
is
barely
known|36692007
in
that country ?|223369002
to physicians|309343006
or
to the patients|116154003
who
have
the disease.|64572001

Lipedema often|234102003|70232002
is
confused|286933003
with obesity,|414915002
and
a significant number|386134007|410680006|386134007|410681005
of patients currently|116154003|15240007
diagnosed|439401001
as obese|414915002
are
believed
to
have
lipedema,|234102003
either
instead of
or
in addition|260364009
to obesity.|414915002

Lipedema|234102003
has
multiple spellings.|260396001

"Lipedema"|234102003
is
the American spelling,
while
"Lipoedema"|234102003
is
used|394850002
in Britain
and
Europe.|223502009

"Lipodema"
is
also
used|394850002
occasionally.
