*Mucolipidosis type I** (ML   I)|38795005
or
*
*sialidosis|38795005
*
*
is
an inherited lysosomal storage disease|255404009|23585005
that results|394617004
from a deficiency|260372006|248325000
of the enzyme sialidase.|90668006|80837006

The lack|41277001
of this enzyme|90668006
results|394617004
in an abnormal accumulation|263654008
of complex carbohydrates|226374001
known|36692007
as mucopolysaccharides,|82565009
and
of fatty substances|105590001
known|36692007
as mucolipids.

Both
of these substances|105590001
accumulate
in bodily tissues.|85756007

The role
of sialidase|80837006
is
to
remove|127485006
a particular form|246176004
of sialic acid|43211003
(
a sugar molecule|2331003|290005005|74801000|290005005
)
from sugar-protein complexes|2331003|88878007|103360007|74801000|88878007|103360007
(
referred|439980006
to
as glycoproteins,|59804006
which
allows
the cell to|4421005|362837007
function|246464006
properly.

Because
the enzyme|90668006
is
deficient, small chains|260372006|255507004|46666003|418446003|255507004|46666003
containing|42504009
the sugar-|2331003|74801000
like material|260769002
accumulate
in neurons,|47220008
bone marrow,|279729006
and
various cells|256220008|4421005
that
defend
the body|279495008|123037004
against infection.

Symptoms ML I|38795005
are
either
present|52101004|246105001
at birth|3950001
or
develop
within the first year|255216001|258707000|255216001|259039008|232714002|258707000|232714002|259039008
of life.|224130005

In many infants|418119000
with ML I,|38795005
excessive swelling|260378005|423666004|260378005|442672001
throughout the body|279495008|123037004
is
noted
at birth.|3950001

These infants|418119000
are
often|70232002
born|106970005|81827009|398209006
with coarse facial features,|46891001|89545001
such as a flat nasal bridge,|6041008|260540009|277035007|6041008|277035007|257564005|260540009|277035007|257564005|277035007
puffy eyelids,|193967004
enlargement|56246009|118452000|442021009
of the gums,|113279002
and
excessive tongue size|260378005|249379001
(macroglossia|270516002|25273001
).

Many infants|260396001|418119000
with ML I|38795005
are
also
born|106970005|81827009|398209006
with skeletal malformations|8447006
such as hip dislocation.|157265008

Infants often|418119000|70232002
develop
sudden involuntary muscle contractions|255363002|102542000
(called myoclonus|17450006
and
have
red spots|386713009|271807003|386713009|285305004|371240000|271807003|371240000|285305004
in their eyes|81745001
(cherry red macules.|49473001

They
are
often unable to|70232002|371151008
coordinate|162258009
voluntary movement|255375007|255324009
(called ataxia.|20262006

Tremors,|26079004
impaired vision,|397540003
and
seizures also|91175000
occur|272120004
in children|410601007|160499008
with ML I.|38795005

Tests|269814003|272393004
reveal|263857004
abnormal enlargement|263654008|56246009|263654008|118452000|263654008|442021009
of the liver|10200004|181268008
(hepatomegaly|80515008
and
spleen|78961009|181279003
(splenomegaly|16294009
and
extreme abdominal swelling.|12565001|41931001|12565001|271860004

Infants|418119000
with ML I generally|38795005
lack|41277001
muscle tone|6918002
(hypotonia|398152000
and
have
mental retardation|91138005
that
is
either
initially|884001
or
progressively severe.|24484000

Many patients|260396001|116154003
suffer
from failure to thrive|433476000
and
from recurrent respiratory infections.|255227004|275498002

Most infants|418119000
with ML I|38795005
die|419620001|399069006|419099009
before the age|424144002
of 1 year.|260305007|258707000|260305007|259039008

Other diseases|74964007|64572001
that
result|394617004
from a deficiency|260372006|248325000
in the sialidase enzyme|80837006|90668006
are
categorized
in a broader group|90522003|261586004|90522003|160481000|90522003|389109008
known|36692007
as sialidoses.|38795005

Because
ML I|38795005
is
classified|73504009
as a sialidosis,|38795005
it
is
sometimes
referred|439980006
to
as
sialidosis type II.|38795005|258195006

A rarer form|84638005|246176004|103356009|246176004
of sialidosis ? sialidosis type 1?|38795005|258191002
occurs|272120004
in children|410601007|160499008
and
adolescents|133937008
and
is
often|70232002
referred to|439980006
as
the juvenile form|133937008|246176004
of the disorder.|64572001

Children usually|410601007|160499008
begin|255395001
to
show
symptoms
during the second decade|81170007|257997001|288495006
of life,|224130005
and
myoclonus|17450006
and
cherry-red macules|49473001
are
often|70232002
the initial symptoms.|884001|232714002

Patients usually|116154003
develop
seizures|91175000
and
progressive deterioration|255314001
of coordinated muscular|162258009|91727004|162258009|263816006
and
mental activities.|257733005
