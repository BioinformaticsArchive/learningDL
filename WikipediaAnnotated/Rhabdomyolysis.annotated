play|300776002
/?r?bd?ma???l?s?s/ is
a condition|260905004
in which
damaged|37782003
skeletal muscle tissue|127954009|426215008
(Greek|1451003
: ????? _rhabdo-_ striped ??? _myo-_ muscle|415627009|91727004
)
breaks
down
(Greek|1451003
: ????? _?lysis_|371757000|239551005
)
rapidly.|418694008

Breakdown products|40091007|125366008
of damaged muscle cells|4421005
are
released|68776005|129299003
into the bloodstream
;
some
of these,
such as the protein myoglobin,|88878007|82693003|88878007|33606006
are
harmful
to the kidneys|64033007|17373004
and
may
lead|88488004
to kidney failure.|42399005

The severity|272141005
of the symptoms,
which
may
include|55919000
muscle pains,|68962001
vomiting|249497008
and
confusion,|286933003
depends
on the extent|255590007
of muscle damage
and
whether kidney failure|42399005
develops.

The muscle damage
may
be
caused|23981006|134198009
by physical factors|5880005|19388002
(e.g.|258795003

crush injury,|125665001
strenuous exercise|61686008
)
,
medications,|410942007
drug abuse,|26416006
and
infections.

Some people|125676002
have
a hereditary muscle condition|255404009|91727004|260905004
that
increases|260366006
the risk|30207005
of rhabdomyolysis.|240131006

The diagnosis|439401001
is
usually
made
with blood tests|252275004
and
urinalysis.|167217005

The mainstay
of treatment|276239002|416118004
is
generous quantities|107651007
of intravenous fluids,|118431008
but
may
include|55919000
dialysis|108241001|265764009
or
hemofiltration|233581009
in more severe cases.[1][2]|242762006|24484000|398241000|242762006|24484000|413769002

Rhabdomyolysis|240131006
and
its complications|116223007
are
significant problems|386134007|55607006
for those
injured
in disasters
such as earthquakes|8766005|217739005
and
bombings.|54807002

Relief efforts|224978009|19487008
in areas|42798000
struck|89098005
by earthquakes often|8766005|70232002|217739005|70232002
include|55919000
medical teams|74188005
with the skills
and
equipment to|246137000
treat|395077000
survivors
with rhabdomyolysis.|240131006

The disease|64572001
was
first|255216001|232714002
described
in the 20th century,
and
important discoveries
as to its mechanism|257544000
were
made
during the Blitz
of London
in 1941.

Horses|35354009
may
also
suffer
from rhabdomyolysis|240131006
from a variety
of causes.[4]|134198009

The symptoms
of rhabdomyolysis|240131006
depend
on the severity|272141005
of the condition,|260905004
and
whether kidney failure|42399005
develops.

Milder|255604002
forms|246176004
of rhabdomyolysis|240131006
may
not
cause|23981006|134198009
any muscle symptoms,|91727004
and
the diagnosis|439401001
is
based|418836005
on abnormal blood tests|263654008|252275004
in the context|263491009
of other problems.|74964007|55607006

More severe rhabdomyolysis|242762006|24484000|240131006
is
characterized
by muscle pain,|68962001
tenderness,|247348008
weakness|13791008|260407003
and
swelling|423666004|442672001
of the affected muscles.|247591002|91727004|248448006|91727004

If
the swelling|423666004|442672001
is
very rapid,|260358002|255358001
as
may
happen
after
someone
is
released|68776005|129299003
from
under a collapsed building,|271787007|52071002
the movement|255324009
of fluid|32457005|33463005|255765007
from the bloodstream
into damaged muscle
may
cause|23981006|134198009
low blood pressure|45007003
and
shock.|27942005

Other symptoms|74964007
are
nonspecific|10003008
and
result|394617004
either
from the consequences|103332005
of muscle tissue breakdown|91727004|40091007|91727004|125366008
or
from the condition|260905004
that originally
led|88488004|236874000
to the muscle breakdown.|91727004|40091007|91727004|125366008

Release|58000006|68776005|258760001|129299003|115956009
of the components|246093002
of muscle tissue|91727004
into the bloodstream causes disturbances|134198009
in electrolytes,|86355000
which
can
lead|88488004
to nausea,|422587007
vomiting|249497008
,
confusion,|286933003
coma|371632003|405809000
or
abnormal heart rate|361135004
and
rhythm.|272121000

The urine|78014005
may
be
dark, often|255419005|70232002
described
as "tea-colored",|16313001|103366001
due to the presence|386397008
of myoglobin.|82693003|33606006

Damage|37782003
to the kidneys|64033007|17373004
may
give|419582001
rise
to decreased|1250004|260400001|260371004
or
absent urine production,|2667000|78014005
usually 12
to 24 hours|123027009|259029002
after the initial muscle damage.[1][5]|884001|232714002

Swelling|423666004|442672001
of the damaged muscle occasionally
leads|88488004|236874000
to compartment syndrome?compression|111245009|71173004|111245009|263720003
of surrounding tissues,|355648006|85756007
such as nerves|3057000
and
blood vessels,|59820001
in the same fascial compartment?|262126009|118509002|262126009|306709004
leading|236874000
to the loss
of blood supply|87612001|425398004|119273009|425398004
and
damage|37782003
or
loss
of function|246464006
in the part|260726005
(s)
of the body|279495008|123037004
supplied|425398004
by these structures.

Symptoms
of this complication|116223007|263718001
include|55919000
pain|22253000
or
reduced sensation|398026008
in the affected limb.|247591002|66019005|247591002|243996003|248448006|66019005|248448006|243996003

A second recognized complication|81170007|116223007|81170007|263718001|257997001|116223007|257997001|263718001|288495006|116223007|288495006|263718001
is
disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC),|67406007
a severe disruption|24484000|76555007
in blood clotting|75753009
that
may
lead|88488004
to uncontrollable bleeding.[1][5][6]|131148009

Any form|246176004
of muscle damage
of sufficient severity|51117008|272141005
can
cause|23981006|134198009
rhabdomyolysis.|240131006

Multiple causes|260396001|134198009
can
be
present|52101004|246105001
simultaneously|79970003
in one person.|421379005|125676002

Some people|125676002
have
an underlying muscle condition,|91727004|260905004
usually hereditary|255404009
in nature,|277302009
that
makes
them more prone|242762006|1240000
to rhabdomyolysis.[2][6]|240131006

Poisons|35331000
linked
to rhabdomyolysis|240131006
are
heavy metals|22907001
and
venom|37663002
from insects|106763003
or
snakes.|107280007

Hemlock|261299000
may
cause|23981006|134198009
rhabdomyolysis,|240131006
either
directly
or
after consuming quail
that
have
fed|238092004
on it.

Haff disease|64572001
is
rhabdomyolysis|240131006
after consuming fish|90580008
;
a toxic cause|134198009
is
suspected|415684004
but
has
not
been
proven.[10]|277025001

Drugs|410942007
of abuse,|26416006|386702006|417928002
including|55919000
:
alcohol,|419442005|53041004|430837008
amphetamine,|373338002
cocaine,|387085005|29142004
heroin,|387341002
ketamine,|373464007
LSD|15698006
and
MDMA|288459003
(ecstasy|288459003|67877007
)
[1][6]|260305007

Recurrent rhabdomyolysis|255227004|240131006
may
result|394617004
from intrinsic muscle enzyme deficiencies,|260521003|91727004|90668006|260372006|260521003|91727004|90668006|248325000|255406006|91727004|90668006|260372006|255406006|91727004|90668006|248325000
which
are
usually
inherited|255404009
and
often|70232002
appear
during childhood.|68433009

Many structural muscle diseases|129565002
feature
episodes|272128006
of rhabdomyolysis|240131006
that
are
triggered|410658008
by exercise,|61686008
general anesthesia|50697003
or
any
of the other causes|74964007|134198009
of rhabdomyolysis|240131006
listed
above.|261183002

Inherited muscle disorders|255404009|129565002
and
infections together
cause|23981006|134198009
the majority
of rhabdomyolysis|240131006
in children.[7]|410601007|160499008

The following hereditary disorders|255260001|32895009
of the muscle energy supply|417447009|425398004
may
cause|23981006|134198009
recurrent|255227004
and
usually exertional rhabdomyolysis|72960004
:
[2][7][11]|260306008

Damage|37782003
to skeletal muscle|127954009|244716004
may
take|419652001
various forms.|256220008|246176004

Crush injuries|125665001
and
other physical causes|74964007|5880005|134198009|74964007|19388002|134198009
damage|37782003
muscle cells directly|91727004|4421005
or
interfere|78235001
with their blood supply,|87612001|425398004|119273009|425398004
while
non-physical causes|5880005|134198009|19388002|134198009
interfere|78235001
with muscle cell metabolism.|91727004|4421005|47722004|91727004|362837007|47722004

When
damaged|37782003
,
muscle tissue rapidly|91727004|418694008
fills
with fluid|32457005|33463005|255765007
from the bloodstream,
including|55919000
sodium ions.|39972003|48006008

The swelling|423666004|442672001
itself
may
lead|88488004
to destruction|64597002
of muscle cells,|91727004|4421005
but
those cells|4421005
that
survive
are
subject to various disruptions|256220008|76555007
that
lead|88488004
to
rise
in intracellular calcium ions|83167003|5540006|48006008
;
the accumulation
of calcium|5540006
in the sarcoplasmic reticulum|24961002
leads|88488004|236874000
to continuous muscle contraction|255238004|12140005
and
depletion|69251000
of ATP,
the main carrier|63161005|47461006|63161005|29679002
of energy|248272003
in the cell.|4421005|362837007

ATP depletion|69251000
can
itself
lead|88488004
to uncontrolled calcium influx.|19032002|5540006

The persistent contraction|78558002
of the muscle cell|91727004|4421005|91727004|362837007
leads|88488004|236874000
to breakdown|40091007|125366008
of intracellular proteins|83167003|88878007
and
disintegration|125366008
of the cell.[2]|4421005|362837007

Neutrophil granulocytes?|116712007
the most abundant type|4757001|261664005
of white blood cell?|52501007
enter|417985001
the muscle tissue,|91727004
producing
an inflammatory reaction|257552002
and
releasing reactive oxygen species,|129299003|11214006|24099007|69658003
[3] particularly|260313008
after
crush injury.|125665001

Crush syndrome|23697004
may
also
cause|23981006|134198009
reperfusion injury
when
blood flow|58190003
to decompressed muscle|91727004
is
suddenly
restored.[2]

The swollen, inflamed muscle|442672001|91727004
may
directly
compress|37204000
structures
in the same fascial compartment,|262126009|118509002|262126009|306709004
causing|23981006
compartment syndrome.|111245009

The swelling|423666004|442672001
may
also further|46053002
compromise
blood supply|87612001|425398004|119273009|425398004
into the area.|42798000

Finally,
destroyed muscle cells|91727004|4421005
release|58000006|68776005|258760001|129299003|115956009
potassium ions,|88480006|48006008
phosphate ions,|350576006
the heme-containing protein myoglobin,|30159006|42504009|82693003|30159006|42504009|33606006
the enzyme creatine kinase|90668006|75828004
and
uric acid|1710001|86228006
(
a breakdown product|40091007|125366008
of purines|45386002
from DNA|24851008
into the blood.|87612001|119273009

Activation
of the coagulation system|246333005|129390001|246333005
may
precipitate
disseminated intravascular coagulation.|67406007

High potassium levels|75540009|365760004|371879000|365760004
may
lead|88488004
to potentially fatal disruptions|399166001|76555007
in heart rhythm.|251149006

Phosphate|259296007|350576006
binds|257768005
to calcium|5540006
from the circulation,|413854007
leading|236874000
to low calcium levels|62482003|71878006|371880002|71878006
in the blood.[3]|87612001|119273009

Rhabdomyolysis|240131006
may
cause|23981006|134198009
renal failure|42399005
by several mechanisms.|261028005|257544000

The most important problem|4757001|55607006
is
the accumulation
of myoglobin|82693003|33606006
in the kidney tubules.|58471003

Normally,
the blood protein haptoglobin|30159006|85294008
binds|257768005
circulating myoglobin|65929005|82693003|65929005|33606006
and
other heme-containing substances,|74964007|57813001|42504009|105590001
but
in rhabdomyolysis|240131006
the quantity|107651007
of myoglobin|82693003|33606006
exceeds
the binding capacity|258732003
of haptoglobin.|85294008

Myoglobinuria,|48165008
the presence|386397008
of myoglobin|82693003|33606006
in the urine,|78014005
occurs|272120004
when
the level|258395000|276625007
in plasma|419185008
exceeds
0.5?1.5 mg/dl|258797006
;
once plasma levels|419185008|258395000
reach|282679008
100 mg/dl,|258797006
the concentration|82742001
in the urine|78014005
becomes
sufficient|51117008
for it to
be
visibly
discolored.|47415006

About 200 grams|258682000
of muscle|91727004
needs|410525008|103325001
to
be
destroyed
for visible myoglobinuria to|24054004|48165008
occur.|272120004

As the kidneys|64033007|17373004
reabsorb
more water|242762006|11713004|242762006|119318008
from the filtrate,
myoglobin|82693003|33606006
interacts
with Tamm?
Horsfall protein|88878007
in the nephron to|54018001|361337001

(solid aggregates|35702001|18403000|78910004|18403000|421378002|18403000
)
that
obstruct|263821009
the normal flow|17621005|258744000
of fluid|32457005|33463005|255765007
;
the condition|260905004
is
worsened further|390772001|46053002|231877006|46053002
by high levels|75540009|258395000|371879000|258395000
of uric acid|1710001|86228006
and
acidification
of the filtrate,
which
increase|260366006
cast|118643004|413771002
formation.|11798007|255277001

Iron|3829006
released|68776005|129299003
from the heme|57813001
generates
reactive oxygen species,|11214006|24099007|69658003
damaging|37782003
the kidney cells.|64033007|4421005|17373004|4421005|181414000|4421005

In addition|260364009
to the myoglobinuria,|48165008
two other mechanisms|420797005|257544000
contribute
to renal impairment|236423003
:
low blood pressure|45007003
leads|88488004|236874000
to constriction|27551008
of the blood vessels|59820001
and
therefore
a relative lack|125677006|41277001|29920004|41277001
of blood flow|58190003
to the kidney,|64033007|17373004|181414000
and
finally uric acid|1710001|86228006
may
form|246176004
crystals|250448002|264297004|413935006
in the tubules|95568003|13336003
of the kidneys,|64033007|17373004
causing|23981006
obstruction.|26036001

Together,
these processes|415178003
lead|88488004
to acute tubular necrosis,|35455006
the destruction|64597002
of the cells|4421005
of tubules.|95568003|13336003

Glomerular filtration rate falls|80274001|1912002
and
the kidney|64033007|17373004|181414000
is
unable to|371151008
perform|398166005
its normal excretory functions.|45111007

This causes disruption|134198009|76555007
of electrolyte regulation,|276025008
leading|236874000
to a further rise|46053002
in potassium levels,|365760004
and
interferes|78235001
with vitamin D processing,|71516007|30178006
further|46053002
worsening|230993007|231877006
the low calcium levels.[3]|62482003|5540006|277735002|371880002|5540006|277735002

A diagnosis|439401001
of rhabdomyolysis|240131006
may
be
suspected|415684004
in anyone
who
has
suffered trauma,
crush injury|125665001
or
prolonged immobilization,|255224006|257884004
but
it
may
also
be
identified|7882003
at a later|260383002
stage|21191007|371508000|261612004
due to deteriorating kidney function|11953005
(abnormally
raised|260399008
or
increasing creatinine|260369004|15373003
and
urea levels,|365755003
falling|1912002
urine output|130953005|365678000
)
or
reddish-brown discoloration|371254008|47415006
of the urine.[1][3]|78014005

The most reliable test|4757001|269814003|4757001|4757001|272393004
in the diagnosis|439401001
of rhabdomyolysis|240131006
is
the level|258395000|276625007
of creatine kinase (CK)|75828004
in the blood.|87612001|119273009

This enzyme|90668006
is
released|68776005|129299003
by damaged muscle,
and
levels|258395000
above 5|264706000|264605009
times the upper limit of normal (ULN)|57615005|261183002|17621005|57615005|261183002|258744000
indicate|410535002
rhabdomyolysis.|240131006

Depending
on the extent|255590007
of the rhabdomyolysis,|240131006
concentrations|82742001
up to 100,000 U/l|258954009
are
not unusual.

CK concentrations|82742001
rise
steadily
for 12 hours|259028005|123035007
after the original muscle injury,|19535007|95847005|19535007|429340002
remain
elevated|75540009
for 1?3 days|260305007|258703001
and
then
fall|1912002
gradually.

Initial|884001|232714002
and
peak CK levels|255587001
have
a linear relationship|50009006|272151006
with the risk|30207005
of acute renal failure|14669001
:
the higher|75540009|371879000
the CK,
the more likely|242762006|2931005
it
is
that kidney damage|64033007|37782003|17373004|37782003|181414000|37782003
will
occur.|272120004

There
is
no specific concentration|69658003|82742001
of CK
above which renal impairment definitely|236423003
occurs|272120004
;
concentrations|82742001
below 20,000 U/l|258954009
are
unlikely to
be
associated|47429007
with a risk|30207005
of renal impairment,|236423003
unless
there
are
other contributing risk factors.|74964007|80943009

Mild rises|255604002
without renal impairment|236423003
are
referred|439980006
to
as
"hyperCKemia".

Myoglobin|82693003|33606006
has
a short half-life,|359530003|224130005|367450005|224130005
and
is
therefore less useful
as a diagnostic test|103693007
in the later stages.|260383002|261612004

Its detection
in blood|87612001|119273009
or
urine|78014005
is
associated|47429007
with a higher risk|15508007
of renal impairment.|236423003

Despite this,
use|277889008|419385000
of urine myoglobin measurement|32375007
is
not
supported|9096001|243114000
by evidence|18669006
as
it
lacks|41277001
specificity|69658003
and
the research studying|110465008|224699009
its utility|225927009
is
of poor quality.[14]|11403006|263496004|255351007|263496004

Elevated concentrations|75540009|82742001
of the enzyme lactate dehydrogenase (LDH)|90668006|259319003
may
be
detected.|260373001

Other markers|74964007
of muscle damage,
such as aldolase,|28598003
troponin,|102680009
carbonic anhydrase type 3|85717001|258199000

mainly
used|394850002

The transaminases,|130093006
enzymes|90668006
abundant
in
both
liver|10200004|181268008
and
muscle tissue,|91727004
are
also usually
increased|35105006|260366006
;
this
can
lead|88488004
to the condition|260905004
being
confused|286933003
with acute liver injury,|272118002|39400004
at least
in the early stages.|264499004|261612004

The incidence
of actual acute liver injury|272118002|39400004
is
25%
in people|125676002
with non-traumatic rhabdomyolysis|240132004
;
the mechanism|257544000
for this
is
uncertain.[1]|64957009

High potassium levels|75540009|365760004|371879000|365760004
tend
to
be
a feature
of severe rhabdomyolysis.|24484000|240131006

Electrocardiography (ECG)|29303009
may
show
whether
the elevated potassium levels|75540009|365760004
are
affecting|247591002|248448006
the conduction system|251089002|246333005|278252000|246333005
of the heart,|80891009|302509004

suggested
by the presence|386397008
of T wave changes|41011002|243326001|41011002|263703002

broadening
of the QRS complex.|164949005

Low calcium levels|62482003|71878006|371880002|71878006

due to binding|257768005
of free calcium|37837009|5540006
to damaged muscle cells.[1]|4421005

Urinalysis|167217005
by urine test strip|167217005|408097009
may
reveal|263857004
a positive result|258758003|394617004|10828004|394617004
for "blood",|87612001|119273009
even
though
no red blood cells|14089001|41898006|258759006|126242007
can
be
identified|7882003
on microscopy|117259009
of the urine|78014005
;
this
occurs|272120004
because
the reagent
on the test strip|269814003|408097009|408097009|272393004|408097009
reacts
with myoglobin.|82693003|33606006

The same phenomenon|262126009
may
happen
in conditions|260905004
that
lead|88488004
to hemolysis,|418983006|404227002|73320003

proves|277025001
its presence|386397008

direct measurement|255589003|272391002

and
other forms|74964007|246176004
of critical illness,|39104002

During an attack,|217315002|216299002
low levels|62482003|258395000|371880002|258395000

these abnormalities|276654001
revert
to normal|17621005|258744000
during convalescence.|105499002

Other tests|74964007|269814003|74964007|272393004
may
be
used|394850002
at that
stage|21191007|371508000|261612004
to
demonstrate
these disorders.|64572001

Disorders|64572001
of glycolysis
can
be
detected|260373001
by various means,|256220008|255586005
including|55919000
the measurement|272391002
of lactate|83036002
after exercise|61686008
;
a failure|76797004
of the lactate to|83036002
rise
may
be
indicative
of a disorder|64572001
in glycolysis,
[6]
while
an exaggerated response|260377000
is
typical
of mitochondrial diseases.

Electromyography (EMG)|42803009
may
show
particular patterns|272135003
in specific muscle diseases|69658003|129565002
;
for instance,
McArdle's disease|55912009
and
phosphofructokinase deficiency|89597008
show
a phenomenon
called
_cramp-|55300003
like contracture_.|55033002

There
are
genetic tests|405824009
available|103328004
for many|260396001
of the hereditary muscle|255404009|91727004
conditions|78326006|260905004

predispose
to myoglobinuria|48165008

rhabdomyolysis.[6][7]|240131006

Muscle biopsy|178263003|309507001
can
be
useful
if
an episode|272128006
of rhabdomyolysis|240131006
is
thought to|88952004
be
the result|394617004
of an underlying muscle disorder.|129565002

A biopsy sample|258415003
taken|419652001
during an episode|272128006
is
often uninformative,|70232002
as
it
will
show
only evidence|50607009|18669006|420295001|18669006
of cell death|4421005|419620001|4421005|268923008|362837007|419620001|362837007|268923008
or
may
appear
normal.|17621005|258744000

Taking|419652001
the sample|123038009
is
therefore
delayed
for several weeks|261028005|258705008
or
months.|258706009

The histopathological appearance|394597005|386548000|394597005|255412001
on the biopsy|86273004
indicates|410535002
the nature|277302009
of the underlying disorder.|64572001

For instance,
mitochondrial diseases
are
characterised
by _ragged red fibers_.|386713009|400293002|386713009|37202001|371240000|400293002|371240000|37202001

Biopsy sites|396991001
may
be
identified|7882003
by medical imaging,|278395004
such as magnetic resonance imaging,|113091000
as
the muscles|91727004
may
not
be
uniformly
affected.[11]|247591002|248448006

The main goal|63161005|410518001
of treatment|276239002|416118004
is
to
treat|395077000
shock|27942005
and
preserve|277405005
kidney function.|11953005

Initially|884001
this
is
done
through the administration|413454004|416118004
of generous amounts|107651007
of intravenous fluids,|118431008
usually isotonic saline|373757009
(0.9% weight|27113001|272102008|39857003
per volume sodium chloride solution|118565006|373757009|419569009|373757009
).

In victims
of crush syndrome|23697004
it
is
recommended to
administer|418283001
intravenous fluids even|118431008
before
they
are
extracted|62972009
from collapsed structures.|271787007|52071002

This
will
ensure
sufficient circulating volume to|51117008|65929005|118565006|51117008|65929005|419569009
deal
with the muscle cell swelling|298280009|4421005|298280009|362837007
(
which typically
commences
when
blood supply|87612001|425398004|119273009|425398004
is
restored
)
,
and
to
prevent
the deposition|46595003
of myoglobin|82693003|33606006
in the kidneys.|64033007|17373004

Amounts|107651007
of 6
to 12 liters|258770004
over 24 hours|123027009|259029002
are
recommended.

The rate
of fluid administration|32457005|413454004|32457005|416118004|33463005|413454004|33463005|416118004|255765007|413454004|255765007|416118004|413454004|416118004
may
be
altered
to
achieve
a high urine output|28442001
(200?300 ml/h|258989006
in adults|133936004
)
,
[6][20]
unless
there
are
other reasons|74964007|410666004
why
this
might
lead|88488004
to complications,|116223007
such as a history|392521001
of heart failure.[20]|84114007|42343007

While
many sources|260753009
recommend
additional intravenous agents to|260364009|260872001|260364009|255560000|260872001
reduce|260400001
damage|37782003
to the kidney,|64033007|17373004|181414000
most
of the evidence|18669006
supporting|9096001|243114000
this practice
comes
from animal studies,|387961004|110465008|387961004|224699009
and
is
inconsistent|260380004
and
conflicting.|15863006

Mannitol|387168006
acts
by osmosis to|47410001
enhance
urine production|78014005
and
is
thought to|88952004
prevent
myoglobin deposition|82693003|46595003|33606006|46595003
in the kidney,|64033007|17373004|181414000
but
its efficacy
has
not
been
shown
in studies|110465008|224699009
and
there
is
a risk|30207005
of worsening renal function.|230993007|11953005|231877006|11953005

The addition|260364009
of bicarbonate|68615006
to the intravenous fluids|118431008
may
alleviate
acidosis|51387008
(high acid level|75540009|34957004|258395000|75540009|34957004|276625007|371879000|34957004|258395000|371879000|34957004|276625007
of the blood|87612001|119273009
)
and
make
the urine more alkaline to|78014005
prevent
cast|118643004|413771002
formation|11798007|255277001
in the kidneys,|64033007|17373004
[2][6]|260306008
but
there
is
limited evidence|255469002|18669006
that
it
has
benefits
above saline alone,|373757009|105529008
and
it
can
worsen|230993007|390772001
hypocalcemia|5291005
by enhancing calcium|5540006
and
phosphate deposition|259296007|46595003|350576006|46595003
in the tissues.|85756007

If urine alkalinization|78014005
is
used,|394850002
the pH|27327002|264723009|264724003|264725002|365723003
of the urine|78014005
is
kept
at 6.5|260271001
or
above.|261183002

Furosemide,|387475002
a loop diuretic,|372691009
is
often|70232002
used to|394850002
ensure
sufficient urine production,|51117008|78014005
[1][3]|260305007
but
evidence|18669006
that
this
prevents|116699007
renal failure|42399005
is
lacking.[21]|41277001

In the initial stages,|884001|261612004|232714002|261612004
electrolyte levels|365758001
are
often abnormal|70232002|263654008
and
require
correction.

High potassium levels|75540009|365760004|371879000|365760004
can
be
life-threatening,|224130005
and
respond
to increased urine production|35105006|78014005|260366006|78014005
and
renal replacement therapy|398887003|276239002|64033007|182819002
(
see|281004000
below
).

Temporary measures|14803004|246445000|14803004|367346004
include|55919000
the administration|413454004|416118004
of calcium to|5540006
protect
against cardiac complications,|40172005
insulin|412222002
or
salbutamol to|372897005
redistribute
potassium|88480006
into cells,|4421005
and
infusions|447826007
of bicarbonate solution.[15]|68615006|8537005|68615006|77899000

Calcium levels initially|71878006|884001
tend
to
be
low,|62482003|371880002
but
as the situation
improves|385425000|3442003|385633008
calcium|5540006
is
released|68776005|129299003
from where
it
has
precipitated
with phosphate,|259296007|350576006
and
vitamin D production resumes,|71516007|30178006
leading|236874000
to hypercalcemia|66931009
(abnormally high calcium levels|371879000|71878006
).

This "overshoot"
occurs|272120004
in 20?30%
of those people|125676002
who
have
developed kidney failure.[1][7]|42399005

Kidney dysfunction typically|39539005
develops
1?2 days|303183002|258703001
after the initial muscle damage.|884001|232714002

If supportive treatment|276239002|416118004
is
inadequate to|71978007
manage|119270007
this,
renal replacement therapy (RRT)|398887003|276239002|64033007|182819002
may
be
required.

RRT
removes|127485006
excess potassium,|238142003
acid|34957004
and
phosphate|259296007|350576006
that
accumulate
when
the kidneys|64033007|17373004
are
unable to|371151008
function|246464006
normally
and
is
required
until kidney function|11953005
is
regained.[1]

Three main modalities|421291004|63161005
of RRT
are
available|103328004
:
hemodialysis,|302497006
continuous hemofiltration|233583007
and
peritoneal dialysis.|71192002

The former two|9130008|420797005
require
access|260507000
to the bloodstream
(
a dialysis catheter,|397849009
while
peritoneal dialysis|71192002
is
achieved
by instilling fluid|421538008|32457005|421538008|33463005|421538008|255765007|421538008
into the abdominal cavity|52731004|361294009
and
later
draining|32712000
it.

Hemodialysis,|302497006
which
is
normally
done
several|261028005
times a week|258705008|259038000
in chronic kidney disease,|46177005|236425005
is
often|70232002
required
on a daily basis|69620002|69620002|418836005
in rhabdomyolysis.|240131006

Its advantage
over continuous hemofiltration|233583007
is
that one machine|421379005|61284002
can
be
used|394850002
multiple|260396001
times a day,|258703001|259032004
and
that continuous administration|255238004|413454004|255238004|416118004
of anticoagulant drugs|372862008
is
not necessary.

Hemofiltration|233581009
is
more effective|242762006|255403003|242762006|254648000
at removing large molecules|127485006|255509001|290005005
from the bloodstream,
such as myoglobin,|82693003|33606006
[7]
but
this
does
not
seem
to
confer
any particular benefit.

Peritoneal dialysis|71192002
may
be
difficult|52925006
to administer|418283001
in someone
with severe abdominal injury,|24484000|128069005
[3]|260313008
and
it
may
be
less effective|276139006|255403003|276139006|254648000|263796003|255403003|263796003|254648000
than the other modalities.[1]|74964007

Compartment syndrome|111245009
is
treated|28995006
with surgery to|83578000
relieve|397855004
the pressure|279046003|13543005|257893003
inside the muscle compartment|91727004
and
reduce|260400001
the risk|30207005
of compression|71173004|263720003
on blood vessels|59820001
and
nerves|3057000
in
that area.|42798000

Fasciotomy|13885002
is
the incision|34896006
of the affected compartment.|247591002|248448006

Often,|70232002
multiple incisions|260396001|34896006
are
made
and
left|7771000
open|56116003
until the swelling|423666004|442672001
has
reduced.|260400001

At
that point,
the incisions|34896006
are
closed|29179001
,
often|70232002
requiring
debridement|36777000
(removal|118292001|128303001
of non-viable tissue|263927007|85756007
)
and
skin grafting|72456008|13853000
in the process.|415178003

The need|410525008|103325001
for fasciotomy|13885002
may
be
decreased|1250004|260400001|260371004
if mannitol|387168006
is
used,|394850002
as
it
can
relieve|397855004
muscle|91727004
swelling|423666004|442672001
directly.[19][20]

Disseminated intravascular coagulation generally|67406007
resolves
when
the underlying causes|134198009
are
treated|28995006
,
but
supportive measures|246445000|367346004
are
often|70232002
required.

For instance,
if
the platelet count|61928009|365632008
drops|426684005|404218003
significantly
and
there
is
resultant bleeding,|131148009
platelets|16378004
may
be
administered.[22]|418283001

The prognosis|20481000
depends
on the underlying cause|134198009
and
whether
any complications|116223007
occur.|272120004

Rhabdomyolysis|240131006
complicated|255302009
by acute kidney impairment|236424009
in patients|116154003
with traumatic injury
may
have
a mortality rate|409651001
of 20%.

Admission|32485007
to the intensive care unit|309904001
is
associated|47429007
with a mortality|409651001
of 22%
in the absence|2667000|418560003
of acute kidney injury,|14669001
and
59%
if
renal impairment|236423003
occurs.|272120004

Most people|125676002
who
have
sustained|263892007
renal impairment|236423003
due to rhabdomyolysis fully|240131006
recover|74822006
their renal function.[2]|11953005

The exact incidence
of rhabdomyolysis|240131006
is
difficult to|52925006
establish|263748003
,
because
different definitions|263735002
have
been
used.|394850002

In 1995,
hospitals
in the U.S.|223688001

reported|229059009|223458004
26,000 cases|398241000|413769002
of rhabdomyolysis.|240131006

Up to 85%
of people|125676002
with major traumatic injuries|255603008
will
experience
some degree|258395000|246173007
of rhabdomyolysis.|240131006

Of those with rhabdomyolysis,|20401003|240131006|421463005|240131006
10?50%
develop
acute kidney injury.|14669001

The risk|30207005
is
higher|75540009|371879000
in people|125676002
with a history|392521001
of illicit drug use,|307052004
alcohol misuse|419442005|53041004|430837008
or
trauma
when
compared
to muscle diseases,|129565002
and
it
is
particularly high|75540009|371879000
if
multiple contributing factors|260396001
occur|272120004
together.

Rhabdomyolysis|240131006
accounts
for 7?10%
of all cases|398241000|413769002
of acute kidney injury|14669001
in the U.S.[2][7]

Crush injuries|125665001
are
common|72906007
in major disasters,|255603008
but
especially so
in earthquakes.|8766005|217739005

The aftermath
of the 1988 Spitak earthquake|8766005|217739005
prompted
the establishment,
in 1995,
of the Renal Disaster Relief Task Force,|64033007|224978009|64033007|224978009|285653008
a working group|261041009|261586004|261041009|160481000|261041009|389109008
of the International Society of Nephrology|394589003
(
a worldwide body|279495008|123037004
of kidney experts|64033007|17373004|181414000
).

Its volunteer doctors|160772005|309343006|428024001|309343006
and
nurses|106292003
assisted|371152001
for the first time|255216001|410669006|232714002|410669006
in the 1999 ?zmit earthquake|8766005|217739005
in Turkey,|278900006|20657003
where 462 people|125676002
received
dialysis,|108241001|265764009
with positive results.|258758003|394617004|10828004|394617004

Treatment units|276239002|258666001|416118004|258666001
are
generally
established|263748003|385645004
outside the immediate disaster area,|88694003|42798000|49499008|42798000
as
aftershocks
could
potentially
injure
or
kill staff|248007002
and
make
equipment unusable.[1][19]|246137000

The Bible
may
contain|42504009
an early account|264499004
of rhabdomyolysis.|240131006

In Numbers 11|410680006|410681005
:
31?33,|264664006|264667004
the Pentateuch says|66049007
that
the Jews|160543007
demanded
wholesome food|255620007
while
traveling|420008001
in the desert|284565008
;
God sent quail
in response
to the complaints,|409586006
and
people|125676002
ate|48263008
large quantities|255509001|107651007
of quail meat.|28647000

A plague then|58750007
broke
out,|255529000
killing|248007002
numerous people.|260396001|125676002

Rhabdomyolysis|240131006
after consuming quail
was
described
in more recent times|242762006|6493001|410669006|242762006|6493001|417929005
and
called
_coturnism_
(
after
_Coturnix_,|396530007
the main quail genus|63161005|18511007
).

Migrating quail
consume
large amounts|255509001|107651007
of hemlock,|261299000
a known cause|36692007|134198009
of rhabdomyolysis.[1]|240131006

In modern times,|410669006|417929005
early|264499004
reports|229059009|223458004
from the 1908 Messina earthquake|8766005|217739005
and
World War I|42146005|22971001
on renal failure|42399005
after injury
were
followed|367409002
by studies|110465008|224699009
by London physicians Eric Bywaters|309343006
and
Desmond Beall,
working|261041009
at the Royal Postgraduate Medical School|74188005|257698009
and
the National Institute for Medical Research,|385437003|74188005
on four victims|421534005
of The Blitz
in 1941.

Myoglobin|82693003|33606006
was
demonstrated
in the urine|78014005
of victims
by spectroscopy,
and
it
was
noted
that
the kidneys|64033007|17373004
of victims
resembled
those
of patients|116154003
who
had
hemoglobinuria|68600005
(hemoglobin|38082009
rather than
myoglobin|82693003|33606006
being
the cause|134198009
of the kidney damage|64033007|37782003|17373004|37782003|181414000|37782003
).

In 1944 Bywaters
demonstrated
experimentally
that
the renal failure|42399005
was
mainly
caused|23981006|134198009
by myoglobin.|82693003|33606006

Already
during the war,
teams
of doctors|309343006

horses.|35354009

Horses|35354009
can
develop
a number|410680006|410681005
