)
is
a viral infectious disease|34014006
of the upper respiratory tract|58675001|361381009
which
affects|4065008
primarily
the nose.|260540009|181195007

Symptoms
include|55919000
coughing,|272039006
sore throat,|405737000|267102003
runny nose,|267101005
and
fever|386661006
which usually
resolve
in seven|420359007
to
ten|23067006|420258001
days,|258703001
with some symptoms
lasting
up to three weeks.|421291004|258705008

Well over 200 viruses|20572008|21481007|49872002
are
implicated
in the cause|134198009
of the common cold|82272006|54150009
;
the rhinoviruses|90389005
are
the most common.|4757001|72906007

Upper respiratory tract infections|54150009
are
loosely
divided|422033008
by the areas|42798000
they
affect|4065008
,
with the common cold primarily|82272006|54150009
affecting|247591002|248448006
the nose,|260540009|181195007
the throat|54066008|49928004|264231000
(pharyngitis,|405737000
and
the sinuses|2095001
(sinusitis.|36971009

Symptoms
are
mostly
due to the body's immune response|279495008|35024006|123037004|35024006
to the infection
rather than
to tissue destruction|85756007|64597002
by the viruses|49872002
themselves.

The primary method|63161005|260686004|63161005|272394005|261424001|260686004|261424001|272394005
of prevention|169443000
is
by
hand washing|258154008
with some evidence to|18669006
support|9096001|243114000
the effectiveness|255403003
of wearing face masks.|261382003

No cure
for the common cold|82272006|54150009
exists
,
but
the symptoms
can
be
treated.|28995006

It
is
the most frequent infectious disease|4757001|70232002|191415002
in humans|278412004
with the average adult contracting two|133936004|78558002|420797005
to three|421291004
colds|82272006
a year|258707000|259039008
and
the average child contracting|410601007|78558002|160499008|78558002
between six|422218008
and
twelve.|82809009

These infections
have
been
with humanity|278412004
since
antiquity.

The typical symptoms
of a cold|285686007|82272006|84162001
include|55919000
cough,|272039006
runny nose,|267101005
nasal congestion|68235000
and
a sore throat,|405737000|267102003
sometimes
accompanied
by muscle ache,|68962001
fatigue,|84229001
headache,|25064002
and
loss
of appetite.|33911006

A sore throat|405737000|267102003
is
present|52101004|246105001
in about 40%|259031006
of the cases|398241000|413769002
and
a cough|272039006
in about 50%,
[2]|260306008
while
muscle ache|68962001
occurs|272120004
in about half.

In adults,|133936004
a fever|386661006
is
generally
not
present|52101004|246105001
but
it
is
common|72906007
in infants|418119000
and
young children.|84422007|410601007|84422007|160499008

The cough|272039006
is
usually mild|255604002
compared
to that accompanying influenza.|6142004|396425006

While
a cough|272039006
and
a fever|386661006
indicate|410535002
a higher likelihood|75540009|2931005|371879000|2931005
of influenza|6142004|396425006
in adults,|133936004
a great deal|255509001|263768009
of similarity
exists
between these two conditions.|420797005|260905004

A number|410680006|410681005
of the viruses|49872002
that
cause|23981006|134198009
the common cold|82272006|54150009
may
also
result|394617004
in asymptomatic infections.|28456004

The color|263714004
of the sputum|45710003
or
nasal secretion|260540009|46242002|46242002
may
vary
from clear|263707001
to yellow|263935005
to green|371246006
and
does
not
predict
the class|258391009
of agent|260872001
causing|23981006
the infection.[7]

A cold usually|285686007|82272006|84162001
begins|255395001
with fatigue,|84229001
a feeling|285854004
of
being
chilled,|43724002
sneezing|162367006
and
a headache,|25064002
followed|367409002
in a couple
of days|258703001
by a runny nose|267101005
and
cough.|272039006

Symptoms
may
begin|255395001
within 16 hours|258702006
of exposure[8]|71677004|24932003
and
typically peak two|255587001|420797005
to four days|421534005|258703001
after onset.|77374008

They usually
resolve
in seven|420359007
to
ten|23067006|420258001
days|258703001
but
some
can
last
for
up to three weeks.|421291004|258705008

In children,|410601007|160499008
the cough lasts|272039006
for more
than ten days|23067006|258703001|420258001|258703001
in 35?40%|259031006
of the cases|398241000|413769002
and
continues|255238004
for more
than 25 days|258703001
in 10%.[11]

The common cold|82272006|54150009
is
a viral infection|34014006
of the upper respiratory tract.|58675001|361381009

The most commonly implicated virus|4757001|49872002|4757001
is
a rhinovirus|90389005
(30?80%
)
,
a type|261664005
of picornavirus|407344006|407345007
with 99 known serotypes.|36692007|276770009

Others|74964007
include|55919000
:
coronavirus|243608008
(10?15%
)
,
human parainfluenza viruses,|407498006
human respiratory syncytial virus,|6415009
adenoviruses,|424470006
enteroviruses,|243633006
and
metapneumovirus.|407501006

Frequently more|70232002
than one virus|421379005|49872002|421379005
is
present.|52101004|246105001

In total|258755000|255619001
over 200 different viral types|263735002|261664005
are
associated|47429007
with colds.[3]|82272006

The common cold virus|82272006|49872002|82272006|54150009|49872002|54150009
is
typically
transmitted|60117003|258150004
via airborne droplets
(aerosols|64242006|52262001
)
,
direct contact|255589003|11723008|255589003|70862002
with infected nasal secretions,|260540009|46242002|46242002
or
fomites
(contaminated objects|62604006|260787004
).

Which
of these routes
is
of primary importance|63161005|261424001
has
not
been
determined.

The viruses|49872002
may
survive
for prolonged periods|248966006
in the environment|276339004
and
can
be
picked
up
by people's hands|125676002|85562004
and
subsequently
carried|288345009
to their eyes|81745001
or
nose|260540009|181195007
where infection
occurs.|272120004

Transmission|258150004
is
common|72906007
in daycare
and
at school|257698009
due to the close proximity|29179001
of many children|410601007|160499008
with little immunity|58915005
and
frequently poor hygiene.|70232002|11403006|284779002|70232002|255351007|284779002

These infections
are
then brought home|68369002|261770009
to other members|74964007|394852005
of the family.|35359004

There
is
no evidence|18669006
that recirculated air|417696007
during commercial flight
is
a method|260686004|272394005
of transmission.|258150004

However,
people|125676002
sitting|33586001
in close proximity|29179001
appear
at greater risk.|263768009|30207005

Rhinovirus-caused colds|90389005|23981006|82272006|90389005|134198009|82272006
are
most infectious|4757001
during the first three days|255216001|421291004|258703001|232714002|421291004|258703001
of symptoms
;
they
are
much less infectious afterwards.[19]|242762006|4757001

The traditional folk theory|263901007
is
that
a cold|285686007|82272006|84162001
can
be
"caught"|30623001|282673009
by prolonged exposure|255224006|71677004|255224006|24932003
to cold weather|45893009
such as rain
or
winter conditions,|260905004
which
is
how
the disease got|64572001
its name.

The role
of body cooling|241741007
as a risk factor|80943009
for the common cold|82272006|54150009
is
controversial.

Some
of the viruses|49872002
that
cause|23981006|134198009
the common colds|82272006
are
seasonal,|21864008
occurring|272120004
more frequently|242762006|70232002
during cold|285686007|82272006|84162001
or
wet weather.|17461003

Some
believe
this to
be
due primarily|42752001
to increased time spent indoors|35105006|410669006|260366006|410669006
in close proximity|29179001
;[23] specifically children|264657009|410601007|264657009|160499008
returning|7528007
to school.|257698009

However,
it
may
also
be
related|272151006|262094002
to changes|243326001|263703002
in the respiratory system|20139000|278197002
that result|394617004
in greater susceptibility.|263768009|76522002|263768009|118588007

Low humidity|44974002
increases|260366006
viral transmission rates potentially|258150004
due to dry air|13880007|417696007
allowing
small viral droplets to|255507004
disperse|86902002
farther|46053002
and
stay
in the air longer.[24]|417696007|255511005

Herd immunity,|418788006|58915005
generated
from previous exposure|9130008|71677004|9130008|24932003
to cold viruses,|285686007|49872002|82272006|49872002|84162001|49872002
plays|300776002
an important role
in limiting viral spread,|255469002|410677005
as
seen
with younger populations|84422007|385436007
that
have
greater rates|263768009
of respiratory infections.|275498002

Poor immune function|11403006|255351007
is
also
a risk factor|80943009
for disease.|64572001

Insufficient sleep|71978007|258158006|423437008|258158006
and
malnutrition|248325000
have
been
associated|47429007
with a greater risk|263768009|30207005
of developing infection
following|255260001
rhinovirus exposure|90389005|71677004|90389005|24932003
;
this
is
believed to
be
due to their effects|253861007
on immune function.[27][28]

The symptoms
of the common cold|82272006|54150009
are
believed
to
be
primarily
related|272151006|262094002
to the immune response|35024006
to the virus.|49872002

The mechanism|257544000
of this immune response|35024006
is
virus specific.|49872002|69658003|69658003

For example,
the rhinovirus|90389005
is
typically
acquired|255396000
by direct contact|255589003|11723008|255589003|70862002
;
it
binds|257768005
to human ICAM-1 receptors|278412004|67164001|116647005
through unknown mechanisms to|261665006|257544000
trigger|410658008
the release|58000006|68776005|258760001|129299003|115956009
of inflammatory mediators.|49352002

These inflammatory mediators then|49352002
produce
the symptoms.

It
does
not generally
cause|23981006|134198009
damage|37782003
to the nasal epithelium.|260540009|31610004|31610004

The respiratory syncytial virus (RSV)
on the other hand|74964007|85562004|74964007|302539009
is
contracted|78558002
by
both
direct contact|255589003|11723008|255589003|70862002
and
air born droplets.|417696007

It then
replicates|1305003
in the nose|260540009|181195007
and
throat|54066008|49928004|264231000
before
frequently|70232002
spreading|410677005
to the lower respiratory tract.|82094008|281488008

RSV
does
cause epithelium damage.|134198009|31610004|37782003

Human parainfluenza virus typically|407498006
results|394617004
in inflammation|257552002
of the nose,|260540009|181195007
throat,|54066008|49928004|264231000
and
bronchi.|955009

In young children|84422007|410601007|84422007|160499008
when
it
affects|4065008
the trachea|44567001|181213009
it
may
produce
the symptoms
of croup|71186008
due to the small size|255507004|277049003
of their airway.[31]|43725001|264664006|89187006|264664006

The distinction
between different viral upper respiratory tract infections|263735002|281794004
is
loosely
based|418836005
on the location|246267002
of symptoms
with the common cold affecting primarily|82272006|247591002|82272006|248448006|54150009|247591002|54150009|248448006
the nose,|260540009|181195007
pharyngitis|405737000
the throat,|54066008|49928004|264231000
and
bronchitis|32398004
the lungs.|39607008

There however
can
be
significant overlap|386134007|24846002
and
multiple areas|260396001|42798000
can
be
affected.|247591002|248448006

The common cold|82272006|54150009
is
frequently|70232002
defined
as nasal inflammation|260540009|257552002|257552002
with varying amount|107651007
of throat inflammation.|405737000

Self-diagnosis|439401001
is
frequent.|70232002

Isolation|40174006|46651001
of the actual viral agent|260872001
involved|248448006
is
rarely|103356009
performed|398166005
,
[32]
and
it
is
generally
not possible to|371930009|60022001
identify|7882003
the virus type|277234002
through symptoms.[3]

Physical measures to|5880005|246445000|5880005|367346004|19388002|246445000|19388002|367346004
prevent
the

of cold viruses|285686007|49872002|82272006|49872002|84162001|49872002
have
been
deemed
the only potentially effective measures|50607009|255403003|246445000|50607009|255403003|367346004|50607009|254648000|246445000|50607009|254648000|367346004|420295001|255403003|246445000|420295001|255403003|367346004|420295001|254648000|246445000|420295001|254648000|367346004
for prevention.|169443000

These measures|246445000|367346004
include|55919000
primarily
hand washing|258154008
and
face masks|261382003
;
in the health care environment,|263775005|224793003
gowns|15922004

Efforts|19487008
such as quarantine|170499009
are
not possible|371930009|60022001
as the disease|64572001
is
so widespread|223528007|85333001
and

are
non-specific.|10003008

Vaccination
has
proved difficult|277025001|52925006
as
there
are
so many viruses|223528007|49872002
involved|248448006
and
they
change|243326001|263703002
rapidly.|418694008

Creation|410615009
of a broadly effective vaccine|255403003|398827000|254648000|398827000
is
thus highly improbable.[34]|75540009

Regular|17854005
hand washing|258154008

the transmission|258150004

Treatment thus|276239002|416118004
comprises
symptomatic relief.|264931009|224978009

reasonable conservative measures.|410666004|246445000|410666004|367346004

Much
of the benefit
from treatment|276239002|416118004
is
however
attributed|246061005
to the placebo effect.[40]|253861007|259031006

Treatments|276239002
that
help
alleviate symptoms|225353007
include|55919000
simple analgesics|13673007|373265006

antipyretics|76644002
such as ibuprofen[41]|387207008
and
acetaminophen/paracetamol.|387517004|387517004

Evidence|18669006
does
not
show
that cough medicines|372791003
are
any more effective|255403003|254648000
than simple analgesics[43]|13673007|373265006
and
they
are
not
recommended
for use|277889008|419385000
in children|410601007|160499008

of evidence supporting effectiveness|18669006|9096001|255403003|18669006|243114000|255403003
and
the potential|30207005
for harm.

In 2009,
Canada|223686002
restricted|263856008
the use|277889008|419385000

under
due to concerns
regarding
risks|30207005

In adults there|133936004
is

the use|277889008|419385000
of cough medications|272039006|410942007
in adults.|133936004

The misuse
of dextromethorphan|387114001
(
an over-the-counter cough medicine|80288002|272039006
)
has
led|88488004|236874000
to its ban
in a number|410680006|410681005
of countries.[47]|223369002

In adults|133936004
the symptoms
of a runny nose|267101005
can
be
reduced|260400001
by first-generation antihistamines|255216001|372806008|232714002|372806008
;
however,
they
are
associated|47429007
with adverse effects
such as drowsiness.|271782001

Other decongestants|74964007|417901007
such as pseudoephedrine|372900003|105313001
are
also effective|255403003|254648000
in this population.|385436007|389109008

Ipratropium nasal spray|372518007|385157007
may
reduce|260400001
the symptoms
of a runny nose|267101005
but
there
is
little effect|253861007
on stuffiness.

Second-generation antihistamines however|372624008
do
not
appear
to
be
effective.[50]|255403003|254648000

Due to lack|41277001
of studies,|110465008|224699009
it
is
not
known|36692007
whether increased fluid intake|249480002
improves|385425000|3442003|385633008

of heated humidified air.|88999006|417696007

One study|421379005|110465008|421379005|224699009
has
found chest vapor rub to|404684003|261179002|261179002
be
effective|255403003|254648000
at providing
some symptomatic relief|264931009|224978009
of nocturnal cough,|62548007

Antibiotics|255631004
have
no effect|253861007
against viral infections|34014006
and
thus
have
no effect|253861007
against the viruses|49872002
that
cause|23981006|134198009
the common cold.|82272006|54150009

Due to their side effects
they
cause|23981006|134198009
overall harm
;
however,
they
are
still frequently|70232002
prescribed.

Some
of the reasons|410666004
that antibiotics|255631004
are
so commonly|223528007
prescribed
include|55919000
:
people's expectations|125676002|410517006
for them,
physicians'|309343006
desire
to do
something,
and
the difficulty|371157007
in excluding complications|77765009|116223007
that
may
be
amenable
to antibiotics.|255631004

There
are
no effective antiviral drugs|255403003|372701006|254648000|372701006
for the common cold even|82272006|54150009
though
some preliminary research|261420005
has
shown
benefit.[39][57]

While
there
are
many alternative treatments|260396001|276239002
used|394850002
for the common cold,|82272006|54150009
there
is
insufficient scientific evidence to|71978007|18669006|423437008|18669006
support|9096001|243114000
the use|277889008|419385000
of most.

As of 2010 there
is
insufficient evidence to|71978007|18669006|423437008|18669006
recommend
for
or
against
either
honey|227598003|421498008
or
nasal irrigation.|260540009|67889009|67889009

Studies|110465008|224699009
suggested
that zinc,|86739005
if
taken|419652001
within 24 hours|123027009|259029002
of the onset|77374008
of symptoms,
reduces|260400001
the duration|103335007
and
severity|272141005
of the common cold|82272006|54150009
in healthy people.|263775005|125676002

Due to wide differences|90522003|263735002
between the studies,|110465008|224699009
further research|46053002
may
be
needed|410525008|103325001
to
determine
how
and
when
zinc|86739005
may
be
effective.|255403003|254648000

Vitamin C's effect|46123006|253861007
on the common cold|82272006|54150009
while
extensively
researched
is
disappointing,
except
in limited circumstances,|255469002

vigorously|419913006
in cold environments.|285123000

Evidence|18669006
about the usefulness
of echinacea|412179000
is
inconsistent.|260380004

Different types|263735002|261664005
of echinacea supplements|412179000|373453009
may
vary
in their effectiveness.|255403003

It
is
unknown|261665006
if garlic|59627001|411618001|260172004

effective.|255403003|254648000

A single trial|125681006|110465008|50607009|110465008

benefit.[65]|264695004

The common cold|82272006|54150009
is
generally mild|255604002
and
self-limiting|255469002
with most symptoms generally
improving|385633008
in a week.|258705008|259038000

Severe complications,|24484000|116223007
if
they
occur|272120004
,
are
usually
in the very old,|260358002|70753007

Secondary bacterial infections|2603003|301811001|81170007|301811001

The common cold|82272006|54150009

the most common human disease[66]|4757001|72906007|278412004|64572001
and
all peoples globally|125676002
are
affected.|247591002|248448006

Adults typically|133936004
have
two|420797005
to five infections annually[2][3]|421820001|53281000
and
children|410601007|160499008
may
have
six to ten|422218008|23067006|422218008|420258001

colds|82272006
a year|258707000|259039008

).

Rates
of symptomatic infections|264931009
increase|260366006
in the elderly|105436006
due to a worsening immune system.[25]|230993007|116003000|231877006|116003000

While
the cause|134198009
of the common cold|82272006|54150009
has
only
been
identified|7882003
since
the 1950s
the disease|64572001
has
been
with humanity|278412004
since
antiquity.

Its symptoms
and
treatment|276239002|416118004
are
described
in the Egyptian Ebers papyrus,|297308004|1919006
the oldest existing medical text,|70753007|74188005
written|12261009
before the 16th century BCE.

The name "common cold"|82272006|54150009
came
into use|277889008|419385000
in the 16th century,
due to the similarity
between its symptoms
and
those
of exposure|71677004|24932003
to cold weather.[71]|45893009|264699005

In the United Kingdom,|223860005
the Common Cold Unit|82272006|258666001|54150009|258666001
was
set up|255532002|353734004
by the Medical Research Council|74188005
in 1946
and
it
was
here
that
the rhinovirus|90389005
was
discovered
in 1956.

In the 1970s,
the CCU
demonstrated
that treatment|276239002|416118004
with interferon|49327004
during the incubation phase|21191007
of rhinovirus infection|41546002
protects
somewhat
against the disease,|64572001
[73]
but
no practical treatment|276239002|416118004
could
be
developed.

The unit|258666001
was
closed|29179001
in 1989,
two years|420797005|258707000
after
it
completed research|255594003
of zinc gluconate lozenges|420444000|385087003|420444000|429587008
in the prophylaxis|169443000
and
treatment|276239002|416118004
of rhinovirus colds,|90389005|82272006
the only successful treatment|50607009|182985004|420295001|182985004

The economic impact|134293005
of the common cold|82272006|54150009
is
not well understood|20572008|66216009
in much|242762006|4757001
of the world.

In the United States,|223688001
the common cold|82272006|54150009
leads|88488004|236874000
to 75?100 million physician|309343006
visits
annually|53281000
at a conservative cost estimate|414135002
of $7.7 billion
per year.|258707000|259039008

Americans
spend
$2.9 billion|260306008
on over-the-counter drugs|80288002
and
another $400 million
on prescription medicines|260885003|410942007
for symptomatic relief.|264931009|224978009

More
than one-third|421379005|70905002
of people|125676002
who
saw|281004000
a doctor|309343006
received
an antibiotic prescription,|255631004|260885003
which
has
implications
for antibiotic resistance.|255631004|30714006

An estimated 22?189 million school days|414135002|257698009|258703001
are
missed
annually|53281000
due to a cold.|285686007|82272006|84162001

As a result,|394617004
parents|40683002
missed
126 million workdays to
stay
home to|261770009
care
for their children.|410601007|160499008

added
to the 150 million workdays
missed

suffering
from a cold,|285686007|82272006|84162001
the total economic impact|258755000|134293005|255619001|134293005

exceeds
$20 billion
per year.|258707000|259039008

This accounts
for 40%|259031006
of time|410669006
lost
from work|261041009
in the United States.[77]|223688001
