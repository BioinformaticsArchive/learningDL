A
*
*monster|54900001
*
*
is
any fictional creature,
usually
found|404684003
in legends
or
horror fiction,
that
is
often hideous|70232002
and
may
produce
fear|1402001
or
physical harm|5880005|19388002
by
either
its appearance|386548000|255412001
or
its actions.|129264002

The word "monster"|255373000|54900001
derives
from Latin _monstrum_,
an aberrant occurrence,|260980007|272120004
usually biological,|12893009
that
was
taken|419652001
as a sign|72670004
that
something
was
wrong
within the natural order.[1]|510009

The word|255373000
connotes
something
wrong
or
evil
;
a monster|54900001
is
generally morally objectionable, physically
or
psychologically hideous,
and/or
a freak
of nature.|277302009

It
can
also
be
applied|410618006
figuratively
to a person|125676002
with similar characteristics
like a greedy person|125676002
or
a person|125676002
who
does
horrible things.

Ancient Greco-Roman,|223655008
Celtic,
Semitic,
Norse,
Chinese|297876005|33897005
and
Sumerian
folklore
all
had
a wealth|224166006
of legendary beasts.

During the age|424144002
of silent movies,|263872000
monsters|54900001
tended
to
be
human-sized,|278412004|277049003
e.g.
,
Frankenstein's monster,|54900001
the Golem,
werewolves
and
vampires.

The film _Siegfried_
featured
a dragon
that
was
actually
a giant puppet|80849007
on tracks.|257719005

A few movie dinosaurs|57176003
were
created
with the use|277889008|419385000
of stop-motion animated models,|422117008|56219004
as
in RKO's _King Kong_,
the first giant monster film|255216001|80849007|54900001|232714002|80849007|54900001
of the sound era.|68325009

Universal Studios|73548004
specialized|67995009
in monsters,|54900001
with Bela Lugosi's reprisal
of his stage role,|21191007|371508000|261612004
Dracula,
and
Boris Karloff playing Frankenstein's monster.|300776002|54900001

The studio also
made
several lesser films,|261028005|263796003
such as _Man-Made Monster_,|248153007|54900001|339947000|54900001|278412004|54900001
starring
Lon Chaney,
Jr.
as a carnival side|182353008
show
worker|106541005
who
is
turned|282987006
into an electrically charged killer|18213006
who
dispatches
victims merely
by touching|52962008
them,
causing|23981006
death|419620001|268923008
by electrocution.|6476001

There
was
also
a variant|40885006
of Dr.|309343006

Frankenstein,
the mad surgeon Dr.|304292004|309343006

Gogol
(
played|300776002
by Peter Lorre,
who
transplanted|263903005|24486003
hands|85562004
that
were
reanimated
with malevolent temperaments,|225654005
in the film _Mad Love_.|23682002

Werewolves
were
introduced|127487003
in films
during this period,|259037005
and
similar creatures
were
presented|246105001
in _Cat People_.|448169003|125676002|33384004|125676002|388626009|125676002

Mummies
were
cinematically
depicted
as fearsome monsters|54900001
as well.|20572008

As for giant creatures,|80849007
the _Flash Gordon_ serial|255459008
did
not
use|277889008|419385000
a costumed actor,|12919008
instead
used|394850002
real-life|224130005
lizards|2773008
to
depict
a large dragon|255509001
via use|277889008|419385000
of camera perspective.|14364002

The cinematic monster cycle eventually|257583003|54900001|44180009
wore
thin,|18043004
having
a comedic turn in _Abbott|282987006
and
Costello
Meet|229057006
Frankenstein_
(1948
).

In the post World War II era,|288563008
however,
giant monsters|80849007|54900001
returned|7528007
to the screen|20135006|360156006
with a vigor
that
has
been
causally
linked
to the development|278923009
of nuclear weapons,|38485002
often|70232002
pitting|77855009
the monstrous|54900001
against the scientific elite.

One early example|421379005|264499004
occurred|272120004
in the American film _
The Beast
from 20,000 Fathoms_,
which
was
about
a dinosaur
that
attacked|52684005
a lighthouse.

Subsequently,
there
were
Japanese film depictions,|414551003
(Godzilla,
Gamera,
British depictions
(Gorgo
)
,
and
even Danish depictions
(Reptilicus,
of giant monsters|80849007|54900001
attacking|52684005|217315002|216299002
cities.|284560003

A recent depiction|6493001
of a giant monster|80849007|54900001
is
the monster|54900001
in [J.

J.

Abrams]
(/wiki/J._J._Abrams
)
's
_Cloverfield_,
which
was
released|68776005|129299003
in theaters January 18,|257715004
2008.

The intriguing proximity
of other planets|74964007
brought|68369002
the notion
of extraterrestrial monsters|54900001
to the big screen,|255509001|20135006|255509001|255509001|360156006
some
of which
were
huge
in size,|277049003
(
such as King Ghidorah
and
Gigan,
while
others|74964007
were
of a more human scale.|242762006|278412004|19892000|242762006|278412004|278111002

During this period,|259037005
the fish-man monster Gill-man|90580008|248153007|54900001|39676003|90580008|339947000|54900001|39676003|90580008|278412004|54900001|39676003
was
developed
in the film series _Creature|13039001
from the Black Lagoon_.|315240009|413464008|15086000|371252007

Britain's Hammer Film Productions|51016001
brought|68369002
colour|263714004
to the monster movies|54900001
in the late 1950s.|260383002

Around this time,|410669006
the earlier Universal films|264499004|73548004
were
usually
shown
on American television|255712000
by independent stations|371153006|255323003
(
rather than
network stations|255323003
)
by
using|260676000
announcers
with strange personas,|125676002|71565002
who
gained|35105006|255396000|260366006|260369004|398092000
legions
of young fans.|84422007|261259003

Although
they
have
since
changed|243326001|263703002
considerably,
movie monsters|54900001
did
not entirely
disappear
from the big screen|255509001|20135006|255509001|255509001|360156006
as
they
did
in the late 1940s.|260383002

Occasionally,
monsters|54900001
are
depicted
as friendly
or
misunderstood creatures.

King Kong & Frankenstein's monster|54900001
are
two examples|420797005
of misunderstood creatures.

Frankenstein's monster|54900001
is
frequently|70232002
depicted
in this manner,
in films
such as _Monster Squad_|54900001
and
_Van Helsing_.|224832000

The Hulk
is
an example
of the "Monster|54900001
as Hero" archetype.

The theme
of the "Friendly Monster"|54900001
is
pervasive|85333001
in pop-culture.|252398009|61594008

Chewbacca,
Elmo,
and
Shrek
are
notable examples
of friendly "monsters".|54900001

The creatures
of _Monsters Inc._ scare children|54900001|410601007|54900001|160499008
in order to
create
energy|248272003
for running machinery,|418060005|20273004
while
the furry monsters|159966006|54900001
of _
The Muppets_
and
_Sesame Street_ live|257710009|419749002|398099009|419749002
in harmony
with animals|387961004
and
humans|278412004
alike.

Japanese culture also commonly|414551003|252398009|414551003|61594008
features
monsters|54900001
which
are
benevolent
and/or
likeable,
with the most famous examples|4757001
being
the _Pok?mon_ franchise
and
the pioneering anime _
My Neighbor Totoro_.|427568008

Monsters|54900001
are
commonly
used|394850002
in fantasy
or
role-playing games,|228585005|51491004
especially role-playing video games,|228585005|257194007|51491004|257194007
when
a large number|255509001|410680006|255509001|410681005
of enemies
to fight|248005005
against
are
needed.|410525008|103325001

However,
the idea|363878000
has
been
used|394850002
across every genre
to varying degrees.|246173007

These
can
include|55919000
aliens,
all types|261664005
of legendary creatures,
or
mutated versions|55446002|22303008
of regular animals.|17854005|387961004

However,
sentient fictional races|415229000
are
usually
not
referred|439980006
to
as
monsters.|54900001

Other times,|74964007|410669006|74964007|417929005
the term
can
carry|288345009
a neutral connotation,
such as
in the _Pok?mon_ franchise,
where
it
is
used to|394850002
refer|439980006
to fictional creatures
that
may
resemble
,
but
are
not,
real world animals.|387961004

Characters
in games
may
refer|439980006
to all animals|387961004
as "
monsters|54900001
".
