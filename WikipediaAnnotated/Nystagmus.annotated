*Nystagmus|563001
*
* /n??st??m?s/
is
a condition|260905004
of voluntary[1]|255375007
or
involuntary eye movement,|162227008|81745001|162227008|244486005|373642008
acquired|255396000
in infancy|3658006
or
later in life,|260383002|224130005
that
may
result|394617004
in reduced|260400001
or
limited vision.[2]|255469002|281004000

There
are
two key forms|420797005|246176004
of nystagmus|563001
:
pathological|394595002|29458008
and
physiological,|1360005
with variations|40885006
within each type.|261664005

Nystagmus|563001
may
be
caused|23981006|134198009
by congenital disorders,|66091009
acquired|255396000
or
central nervous system disorders,|23853001
toxicity,
pharmaceutical drugs|80288002
or
alcohol.|419442005|53041004|430837008

Previously
considered
untreatable,
in recent years several pharmaceutical drugs|6493001|258707000|80288002
have
been
identified|7882003
for treatment|276239002|416118004
of nystagmus.|563001

Nystagmus|563001
can
also
be
a sign|72670004
of vertigo.|399153001

Nystagmus|563001
is
very noticeable|260358002
but
little recognized.

Nystagmus|563001
can
be
clinically
investigated|116698004
by
using|260676000
a number|410680006|410681005
of non-invasive standard tests.|22762002|269814003|22762002|272393004

The simplest one|13673007|421379005
is
the caloric reflex test,|66608006|87572000|66608006|106146005
in which
one|421379005
external auditory meatus|84301002
is
irrigated
with warm
or
cold water|285686007|11713004|285686007|119318008|82272006|11713004|82272006|119318008|84162001|11713004|84162001|119318008
or
air.|417696007

The temperature gradient|105723007|272077000|246508008|272077000
provokes|410658008
the stimulation|122545008
of the horizontal semicircular canal|367616006
and
the consequent nystagmus.|103332005|563001

The resulting movement|42752001|255324009
of the eyes|81745001
may
be
recorded
and
quantified
by special devices|67995009|303607000|67995009|49062001
called
electronystagmograph (ENG),|59851008
a form|246176004
of electrooculography|398736007
(
an electrical method|18213006|260686004|18213006|272394005|258096005|260686004|258096005|272394005
of measuring eye movements|258104002|263571004
using|260676000
external electrodes,|261074009|16470007
[3]|260313008
or
even less invasive devices|10179008|303607000|10179008|49062001
called
videonystagmograph (VNG),
[4]|260308009
a form|246176004
of video-oculography (VOG)|257194007
(
a video-based method|257194007|260686004|257194007|272394005|257194007|418836005|260686004|257194007|418836005|272394005
of measuring eye movements|258104002|263571004
using|260676000
external small cameras|409903006|255507004
built
into head masks|69536005|261382003|302548004|261382003
)
by an audiologist.|309418004

Special swinging|67995009
chairs
with electrical controls|18213006|31509003|258096005|31509003
can
be
used|394850002
to
induce|16404004
rotatory nystagmus.[5]|44526006

Over the past forty years objective eye movement recording techniques|410513005|258707000|410518001|272394005|410513005|258707000|410518001|373642008|272394005|410513005|258707000|260224007|272394005|410513005|258707000|260224007|373642008|272394005
have
been
applied|410618006
to the study|110465008|224699009
of nystagmus,|563001
and
the results|394617004
have
led|88488004|236874000
to a greater accuracy|263768009|263656005
and
understanding|66216009
of the condition.|260905004

Orthoptists|159027001
may
also
use|277889008|419385000
an optokinetic drum,|421798009
or
electrooculography to|398736007
assess
their eye movements.

Nystagmus|563001
can
be
caused|23981006|134198009
by subsequent foveation|255260001
of moving objects,|260787004
pathology,|394595002
sustained rotation|263892007|70433009
or
substance use.|105590001|277889008|105590001|419385000

Nystagmus|563001
is
not to
be
confused|286933003
with other superficially similar-appearing disorders|74964007|64572001
of eye movements
(saccadic oscillations
)
such as opsoclonus|194177006
or
ocular flutter|33466002
that
are
composed
purely
of fast-phase|16985007|21191007|277748003|21191007
(saccadic
)
eye movements,
while
nystagmus|563001
is
characterised
by the combination|89780004
of a smooth pursuit,|91444001
which usually
acts
to
take|419652001
the eye|81745001|244486005
off the point
of regard,
interspersed
with the saccadic movement|255324009
that
serves
to
bring|68369002
the eye|81745001|244486005
back
on target.

Without the use|277889008|419385000
of objective recording techniques,|410518001|272394005|260224007|272394005
it
may
be
very difficult to|260358002|52925006
distinguish
between these conditions.|260905004

In medicine,|410942007
the presence|386397008
of nystagmus|563001
can
be
benign,|30807003
or
it
can
indicate|410535002
an underlying visual|255374006
or
neurological problem.[6]|299960009

Pathologic nystagmus|563001
is
characterized
by a biphasic ocular oscillation|1217004|12273009
alternating|49572008
a slow eye movement,|419443000|419443000|373642008
or
smooth pursuit,|91444001
in one direction|421379005|260672003
and
a fast eye movement,|16985007|16985007|373642008|277748003|277748003|373642008
or
saccadic movement,|255324009
in the other direction.|74964007|260672003

The velocity|272147009
of the slow phase eye velocity (SPEV)|419443000|21191007|81745001|272147009|419443000|21191007|244486005|272147009
and
the fast phase eye velocity (FPEV)|16985007|21191007|81745001|272147009|16985007|21191007|244486005|272147009|277748003|21191007|81745001|272147009|277748003|21191007|244486005|272147009
are
related|272151006|262094002
to each other
and
can
be
considered
as a measurement|272391002
of the efficiency|260375008
of the system stimulus/response.[7]|246333005|8927009

When
nystagmus|563001
occurs|272120004
without fulfilling
its normal function,|17621005|246464006|258744000|246464006
it
is
pathologic|29458008
(deviating|263739008
from the healthy|263775005
or
normal condition|81323004
).

Pathological nystagmus|563001
is
the result|394617004
of damage|37782003
to one|421379005
or
more components|242762006|246093002
of the vestibular system,|361533001
including|55919000
the semicircular canals,|279726004
otolith organs,|1610007|410653004
and
the vestibulocerebellum.|28949004

Pathological nystagmus generally|563001
causes|134198009
a degree|258395000|246173007
of vision impairment,|397540003
although
the severity|272141005
of such impairment|40226000
varies
widely.

Also,
many blind people|125676002|125676002
have
nystagmus,|563001
which
is
one|421379005
reason|410666004
that
some
wear
dark glasses.[8]|255419005|50121007

Physiological nystagmus|314541000
is
a form|246176004
of involuntary eye movement|162227008|81745001|162227008|244486005|373642008
that
is
part|260726005
of the vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR),|90906005
characterized
by alternating smooth pursuit|49572008|91444001
in one direction|421379005|260672003
and
saccadic movement|255324009
in the other direction.|74964007|260672003

The direction|260672003
of nystagmus|563001
is
defined
by the direction|260672003
of its quick phase|255358001|21191007
(_
e.g.
_
a
*
*right-beating nystagmus|24028007|563001
*
*
is
characterized
by a rightward-
moving
quick phase,|255358001|21191007
and
a
*
*left-beating nystagmus|7771000|563001
*
*
by a leftward-
moving
quick phase|255358001|21191007
).

The oscillations
may
occur|272120004
in the vertical,[10] horizontal|33096000|24020000
or
torsional planes,|264747002|260225008
or
in any combination.|89780004

The resulting nystagmus|42752001|563001
is
often|70232002
named|27468005
as a gross description|255344003
of the movement,|255324009
_
e.g.
_
*
*downbeat nystagmus|307676006
*
*,
*
*upbeat nystagmus|307677002
*
*,
*
*seesaw nystagmus|95782001
*
*,
*
*periodic alternating nystagmus|8134005
*
*.

These descriptive names
can
be
misleading
however,
as
many
were
assigned
historically,
solely
on the basis|418836005
of subjective clinical examination,|255362007|5880005
which
is
not sufficient to|51117008
determine
the eyes' true trajectory.|81745001|31874001

The cause|134198009
for pathological nystagmus|563001
may
be
congenital, idiopathic,|6160004|54690008|255399007|54690008
or
secondary|2603003|81170007
to a pre-existing neurological disorder.|236874000|118940003|272113006|118940003

It also
may
be
induced|16404004
temporarily
by disorientation|286933003|62476001
(
such as
on roller coaster rides
)
or
by certain drugs|17162000|410942007
(alcohol|419442005|53041004|430837008
and
other central nervous system depressants,|74964007|9680003|25087005|74964007|9680003|278196006
inhalant drugs,|243132000|410942007
stimulants,|373333006
psychedelic drugs,|255654008
and
dissociative drugs|410942007
).

*
*Early-onset nystagmus|264499004|77374008|563001
*
*
occurs|272120004
more frequently|242762006|70232002
than acquired nystagmus.|314935002

It
can
be
insular|36169008|288560006|279201009
or
accompany other disorders|64572001
(
such as micro-ophthalmic anomalies|19851009|19416009
or
Down Syndrome.|41040004

Early-onset nystagmus|264499004|77374008|563001
itself
is
usually mild|255604002
and
non-progressive.|255314001

The affected persons|247591002|125676002|248448006|125676002
are
not normally aware|312012004
of their spontaneous eye movements,|5054005
but
vision|281004000
can
be
impaired|260379002|40226000
depending
on the severity|272141005
of the movements.|255324009

Types|261664005
of early-onset nystagmus|264499004|77374008|563001
include|55919000
the following|255260001
:

X-linked infantile nystagmus|263934009|3658006|563001|263934009|263784005|563001
is
associated|47429007
with mutations|55446002
of the gene FRMD7,|67271001
which
is
located
on the X chromosome.[12][13]|55401003

Infantile nystagmus|3658006|563001|263784005|563001
is
also
associated|47429007
with two X-linked eye diseases|420797005|263934009|371405004
known|36692007
as complete congenital stationary night blindness (CSNB)|255594003|232061009
and
incomplete CSNB|255599008|255594003|232061009|255609007|255594003|232061009
(iCSNB
or
CSNB-2|255594003|232061009
)
,
which
are
caused|23981006|134198009
by mutations|55446002
of one|421379005
of two genes|420797005|67271001
located
on the X chromosome.|72837006

In CSNB,
mutations|55446002
are
found|404684003
in NYX
(nyctalopin.

CSNB-2
involves|248448006
mutations|55446002
of CACNA1F,
a voltage-gated calcium channel|115568009
that,
when
mutated|55446002
,
does
not
conduct|844005

may
be
acquired|255396000
from
:

Congenital nystagmus|64635004
has
traditionally
been
viewed|246516004
as non-treatable,
but
medications|410942007
have
been
discovered
in recent years|6493001|258707000
that
show
promise
in some patients.|116154003

In 1980,
researchers
discovered
that
a drug|410942007
called
baclofen|387342009
could
effectively
stop|422117008
periodic alternating nystagmus.|8134005

Subsequently,
gabapentin,|386845007
an anticonvulsant,|255632006
was
found|404684003
to
cause|23981006|134198009
improvement
in about half
the patients|116154003
who
received
it to
relieve|397855004
symptoms
of nystagmus.|563001

Other drugs|74964007|410942007
found|404684003
to
be
effective|255403003|254648000
against nystagmus|563001
in some patients|116154003
include|55919000
memantine,|406458000
[19] levetiracetam,|387000003
3,
4-diaminopyridine,|260308009
4-aminopyridine,|413355004
and
acetazolamide.|372709008

Several therapeutic approaches,|261028005|262202000|261028005|262202000|103379005
such as contact lenses,|57368009
[21] drugs,|410942007
surgery,|83578000
and
low vision rehabilitation|397540003|52052004|397540003|394602003
have
also
been
proposed.

Clinical trials|110465008
of a surgery to|83578000
treat|395077000
nystagmus|563001
(
known|36692007
as tenotomy|122484000|78545003
)
concluded
in 2001.

Tenotomy|122484000|78545003
is
being
performed regularly|398166005
at the University of Pittsburgh Children's Hospital|224871002|82242000

Explanations
as to
how acupuncture|44868003

affect|4065008
congenital nystagmus|64635004
are
lacking|41277001

A survey
conducted|844005
in Oxfordshire,|223896009
United Kingdom|223860005

one|421379005
in every 670 children|410601007|160499008

Authors|308004006
of another study|110465008|224699009
in the United Kingdom|223860005
estimated|414135002
an incidence
of 24
in 10,000
(~0.240 %

,
noting
an apparently higher rate|75540009|371879000
amongst white Europeans|413773004|414152003|413773004|185984009|414152003|185984009|371251000|414152003|371251000
