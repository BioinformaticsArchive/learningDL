*Hyperhidrosis|312230002
*
*
is
the condition|260905004
characterized
by abnormally increased perspiration,|35105006|74616000|35105006|161857006|260366006|74616000|260366006|161857006
[1]|260305007
in excess|260378005
of that
required
for regulation
of body temperature.|105723007

Hyperhidrosis|312230002
can
either
be
generalized|60132005
or
localized|255471002
to specific parts|69658003|260726005
of the body.|279495008|123037004

Hands,|85562004
feet,|56459004|259051005
armpits,|422543003
and
the groin area|255575008|42798000
are
among the most active regions|4757001|55561003|410673009
of perspiration|74616000|161857006
due to the relatively high concentration|75540009|82742001|371879000|82742001
of sweat glands.|10410005

When
excessive sweating|52613005
is
localized|255471002
it
is
referred to|439980006
as
primary|63161005|261424001
or
focal hyperhidrosis.|274674005

Generalized|60132005
or
secondary hyperhidrosis usually|2603003|312230002|81170007|312230002
involves|248448006
the body|279495008|123037004
as a whole|260232004
and
is
the result|394617004
of an underlying condition.|260905004

Hyperhidrosis|312230002
can
also
be
classified|73504009
depending
by onset,|77374008
either
congenital|6160004|255399007
or
acquired.|255396000

Primary|63161005|261424001
or
focal hyperhidrosis|274674005
is
found to|404684003
start|255395001
during adolescence|22396007
or
even before
and
seems
to
be
inherited|255404009
as an autosomal dominant genetic trait.|263681008|3950001|263681008|255395001

Primary|63161005|261424001
or
focal hyperhidrosis|274674005
must
be
distinguished
from secondary hyperhidrosis,|2603003|312230002|81170007|312230002
which
can
start|255395001
at any point
in life.|52101004|224130005|18720000|224130005

The latter form|246176004
may
be
due to a disorder|64572001
of the thyroid|69748006|61020000
or
pituitary glands,|56329008
diabetes mellitus,|73211009
tumors,|108369006
gout,|90560007
menopause,|161712005
certain drugs,|17162000|410942007
or
mercury poisoning._[citation|85180002

Hyperhidrosis|312230002
may
be
also
divided|422033008
into palmoplantar
(symptomatic sweating|264931009|161857006
of primarily
the hands|85562004
or
feet|56459004|259051005
)
,
gustatory|255306007
and
generalized hyperhidrosis.[1]|274673004

Alternatively,
hyperhidrosis|312230002
may
be
classified|73504009
according to the amount|107651007
of skin|119325001|39937001|181469002
affected|247591002|248448006
and
its possible causes.|371930009|134198009|60022001|134198009

In this approach,
excessive sweating|52613005
in an area|42798000
greater|263768009
than 100 cm2|259022006|373587001
(16 sq|282383003

)
(
up to
generalized|60132005
sweating|161857006
of the entire body|255503000|279495008|255503000|123037004|260232004|279495008|260232004|123037004
)
is
differentiated|263933003
from sweating|161857006
that
affects|4065008
only
a small area._[citation|255507004|42798000

The cause|134198009
of primary hyperhidrosis|63161005|312230002|261424001|312230002
is
unknown|261665006
,
although
some surgeons_[|304292004
who?_]
claim
it
is
caused|23981006|134198009
by sympathetic overactivity.|28277004

Nervousness
or
excitement|58901008
can
exacerbate|162473008
the situation
for many sufferers.

Other factors|74964007
can
play|300776002
a role
;
certain foods|17162000|255620007
and
drinks,|226465004
nicotine,|68540007
caffeine,|255641001
and
smells|397686008
can
trigger|410658008
a response.

A common complaint|72906007|409586006
of patients|116154003
is
they
get
nervous
because
they
sweat|74616000|161857006
,
then
sweat|74616000|161857006
more
because
they
are
nervous.

Hyperhidrosis|312230002
can
often|70232002
be
very effectively|260358002
managed._[citation|119270007

Aluminium chloride|387372003
is
used|394850002
in regular antiperspirants.|17854005|373747008

However,
hyperhidrosis sufferers|312230002
need|410525008|103325001
solutions|8537005
or
gels|385100002
with a much higher concentration|242762006|75540009|82742001|242762006|371879000|82742001|4757001|75540009|82742001|4757001|371879000|82742001
to effectively
treat|395077000
the symptoms
of the condition.|260905004

These antiperspirant solutions|373747008|8537005
or
hyperhidrosis gels|312230002|385100002
are
especially effective|255403003|254648000
for treatment|276239002|416118004
of axillary|422543003
or
underarm regions.|422543003|410673009

Normally
it
takes|419652001
around three to five days to|421291004|421820001|258703001

The main secondary effect|63161005|2603003|253861007|63161005|81170007|253861007
is
irritation|257553007
of the skin.|119325001|39937001|181469002

For severe cases|24484000|398241000|24484000|413769002
of plantar|57999000|264147007
and
palmar hyperhidrosis,|21547004|312230002|107631008|312230002
there

hyperhidrosis.|312230002

Oxybutynin|372717000

one|421379005
that

Sweat gland removal|10410005|118292001|10410005|128303001
or
destruction|64597002
is
one surgical option|421379005|83578000
available|103328004
for axillary hyperhidrosis.|422543003|312230002

There
are
multiple methods|260396001|260686004|260396001|272394005
for sweat gland removal|10410005|118292001|10410005|128303001
or
destruction|64597002
such as sweat gland suction,|10410005|274441001
retrodermal currettage,
and
axillary liposuction,|422543003|302441008
Vaser,
or
Laser Sweat Ablation.|74616000|161857006

Sweat gland suction|10410005|274441001
is
a technique|272394005
adapted
from liposuction.[8]|302441008

The other main surgical option|74964007|63161005|83578000
is
endoscopic thoracic sympathectomy (ETS),|423827005|57071006|57071006
which cuts,|283396008
burns,|125666000
or
clamps|46364009
the thoracic ganglion|36733007
on the main sympathetic chain|63161005|44909008|63161005|181099004
that
runs|282476009
alongside the spine.|421060004|44300000|243930007

Clamping|410025003
is
intended to|361269008
permit|958006
the reversal
of the procedure.|71388002

ETS
is
generally
considered
a "safe, reproducible,
and
effective procedure|255403003|71388002|254648000|71388002
and
most patients|116154003
are
satisfied
with the results|394617004
of the surgery".|83578000

Satisfaction rates
above 80%
have
been
reported|229059009|223458004
,
and
are
higher|75540009|371879000
for children.|410601007|160499008

The procedure|71388002
causes|134198009
relief|224978009
of excessive hand sweating|52613005|85562004|52613005|302539009
in about 85-95%
of patients.|116154003

ETS
may
be
helpful
in treating axillary hyperhidrosis,|28995006|422543003|312230002
facial blushing|89545001|20255002
and
facial sweating|89545001|161857006
;
however,
patients|116154003
with facial blushing|89545001|20255002
and/or
excessive facial sweating experience higher failure rates,|52613005|89545001|75540009|76797004|52613005|89545001|371879000|76797004
and
patients|116154003
may
be
more likely to|242762006|2931005
experience
unwanted side effects.[13]

ETS side effects
have
been
described
as ranging
from trivial
to devastating.

The most common secondary effect|4757001|72906007|2603003|253861007|4757001|72906007|81170007|253861007
of ETS
is
compensatory sweating,|161857006
sweating|161857006
in different areas|263735002|42798000
than
prior to the surgery.|83578000

Major drawbacks|255603008
related|272151006|262094002
to compensatory sweating|161857006
are
seen
in 20-80%.

Most people|125676002
find
the compensatory sweating to|161857006
be
tolerable
while
1-51%|260305007
claim
that
their quality|263496004
of life|224130005
decreased|1250004|260400001|260371004

to heat|88999006
has
been
reported|229059009|223458004
to
increase|260366006
after sympathectomy.[18]|57071006

Additionally,
the original sweating problem|19535007|52526003
may
recur|246455001
due to nerve regeneration,|3057000|34636005|3057000|278313005|256864008|34636005|256864008|278313005
sometimes
within 6 months|258706009
of the procedure.[15][16][19]|71388002

Other side effects|74964007
include|55919000
Horner's Syndrome|192915005|271730003
(about 1%
)
,
gustatory sweating|56046002
(less

and
on occasion very dry hands|84638005|260358002|13880007|85562004
(sandpaper hands|85562004
).

Some patients|116154003
have
also
been
shown
to
experience
a cardiac sympathetic denervation,|80891009|57071006
which
results|394617004
in a 10% lowered heartbeat|261122009|248646004|385440003|248646004
during
both
rest|258157001
and
exercise|61686008

Lumbar sympathectomy|72910005
is
a relatively new procedure|7147002|71388002
aimed
at those patients|116154003

With this procedure|71388002
the sympathetic chain|44909008|181099004
in the lumbar region|182343007
is
clipped|77720000|21147007|360017003

or
excessive foot sweating.|52613005|56459004|52613005|259051005|52613005|302545001

The success rate|385669000
is
about 97%|260309001|264708004
and
the operation|83578000
should
be
carried|288345009

other conservative measures.|74964007|246445000|74964007|367346004

This type|261664005
of sympathectomy|57071006

Percutaneous sympathectomy|103388001|57071006
is
a related minimally invasive procedure|272151006|441788009|262094002|441788009
similar
to the botulinum method,|419254007|260686004|419254007|272394005
in which
the nerve|3057000|256864008
is
blocked|26036001|112232007
by an injection|28289002|385218009|129326001
of phenol.|300070004|116613007

The procedure|71388002
allows
for temporary relief|14803004|224978009
in most cases.|398241000|413769002

Some medical professionals|74188005
advocate
the use|277889008|419385000
of this more conservative procedure|242762006|71388002
before the permanent surgical sympathectomy.|6934004|57071006

Vitamins|87708000
and
herbal extracts|62972009
are
successfully
used|394850002
to
reduce|260400001
sweating|161857006
in people|125676002

from hyperhidrosis.|312230002

It
is
important to
talk|87335007|286376008
to your health care provider
before trying
any therapy.|276239002

Herbs|256330001
such as sage,|227411006
chamomile,|411517001
valerian root|427339006
and
St.

John's wort
can
all
have
antihidrotic effects|253861007
when
appropriately
supplemented|373453009
into your diet[26].|41829006

Sage tea|227411006|16313001
is
a common remedy|72906007
used|394850002
to counter hyperhidrosis.|303502004|312230002

There
are
also herbal extracts|62972009

miraDry[27]
utilises
a controlled application|31509003|410618006
of microwave energy|64285002|248272003
through a hand-held unit|85562004|421139008|258666001|302539009|421139008|258666001
to heat sweat glands|88999006|10410005
and
destroy
them
through thermolysis.

This technique|272394005
is
implicitly non-invasive.|22762002

Damage|37782003
to the superficial dermis|26283006|53534000
is
prevented|116699007
through cooling
of the external surface|261074009|410678000
of the miraDry unit,|258666001
localising|255471002
the heating
and
cell destruction|4421005|64597002|362837007|64597002
to the lower, gland-containing strata.|261122009|362884007|42504009

Because sweat glands|10410005
do
not
regenerate
after treatment,|276239002|416118004
the results|394617004
are
lasting.[28]

Iontophoresis|91480001|32585009
was
originally
described
in the 1950s,
although
the exact mode
of action|129264002
remains
elusive.

The affected area|247591002|42798000|248448006|42798000
is
placed|257557008|421066005
in a device|303607000|49062001
that
has
two pails|420797005
of water|11713004|119318008
with a conductor
in each one.|421379005

The hand|85562004|302539009
or
foot|56459004|259051005|302545001
acts
like a conductor
between the positively-
and
negatively-charged pails.

As the low current passes|62482003|15240007|371880002|15240007
through the area,|42798000
the minerals|87918000
in the water clog|11713004|119318008
the sweat glands,|10410005
limiting|255469002
the amount|107651007
