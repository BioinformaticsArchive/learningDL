*Meningitis|7180009
*
*
is
inflammation|257552002
of the protective membranes|83097008
covering|255334000
the brain|12738006|258335003
and
spinal cord,|2748008|180959008
known|36692007
collectively
as the meninges.|363824000

The inflammation|257552002
may
be
caused|23981006|134198009
by infection
with viruses,|49872002
bacteria,|409822003
or
other microorganisms,|74964007|264395009
and
less commonly|276139006|263796003
by certain drugs.|17162000|410942007

Meningitis|7180009
can
be
life-threatening|224130005
because of the inflammation's proximity|257552002
to the brain|12738006|258335003
and
spinal cord|2748008|180959008
;
therefore
the condition|260905004
is
classified|73504009
as a medical emergency.[1][3]|74188005|25876001

The most common symptoms|4757001|72906007
of meningitis|7180009
are
headache|25064002
and
neck stiffness|161882006
associated|47429007
with fever,|386661006
confusion|286933003
or
altered consciousness,|3006004
vomiting|249497008
,
and
an inability to
tolerate
light|56242006|371268001
(photophobia|409668002
or
loud noises|24547000
(phonophobia.|313387002

Children often|410601007|70232002|160499008|70232002
exhibit
only nonspecific symptoms,|50607009|10003008|420295001|10003008
such as irritability|55929007
and
drowsiness.|271782001

If
a rash|271807003
is
present,|52101004|246105001
it
may
indicate|410535002
a particular cause|134198009
of meningitis|7180009
;
for instance,
meningitis|7180009
caused|23981006|134198009
by meningococcal bacteria|419013009|409822003
may
be
accompanied
by a characteristic rash.[1][4]|271807003

A lumbar puncture diagnoses|277762005|439401001|265232001|439401001
or
excludes|77765009
meningitis.|7180009

A needle|79068005
is
inserted|257867005
into the spinal canal to|61853006
extract|62972009
a sample|123038009
of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF),|65216001
that
envelops
the brain|12738006|258335003
and
spinal cord.|2748008|180959008

The CSF
is
examined|64049009
in a medical laboratory.|74188005|261904005

The first treatment|255216001|276239002|255216001|416118004|232714002|276239002|232714002|416118004
in acute meningitis|272118002|7180009
consists
of promptly administered antibiotics|418283001|255631004
and
sometimes antiviral drugs.|372701006

Corticosteroids|79440004
can
also
be
used|394850002
to
prevent
complications|116223007
from excessive inflammation.|260378005|257552002

Meningitis|7180009
can
lead|88488004
to serious long-term consequences|42745003|103332005
such as deafness,|343087000|8531006
epilepsy,|313307000
hydrocephalus|230745008
and
cognitive deficits,|260372006
especially
if
not
treated|28995006
quickly.

Some
forms|246176004
of meningitis|7180009
(
such as those
associated|47429007
with meningococci,|17872004
_Haemophilus influenzae_ type B,|103442008
pneumococci|9861002
or
mumps virus infections|50384007
)
may
be
prevented|116699007
by immunization.[1]|127785005

In adults,|133936004
the most common symptom|4757001|72906007
of meningitis|7180009
is
a severe headache,|24484000|25064002
occurring|272120004
in almost 90%|264705001|264703008
of cases|398241000|413769002
of bacterial meningitis,|95883001
followed|367409002
by nuchal rigidity|405947006
(
the inability to
flex|9964006
the neck|45048000|302550007
forward|255540008
passively
due to increased neck muscle tone|56731001|45048000|56731001|302550007
and
stiffness|271587009
).

The classic triad|255301002|255333006
of diagnostic signs|439401001|72670004|261004008|72670004
consists
of nuchal rigidity,|405947006
sudden high fever,|255363002|75540009|386661006|255363002|371879000|386661006
and
altered mental status|419284004
;
however,
all three features|421291004
are
present|52101004|246105001
in only 44?46%|50607009|420295001
of bacterial meningitis cases.|95883001|398241000|95883001|413769002

If none|260413007
of the three signs|421291004|72670004
is
present, meningitis|52101004|7180009|246105001|7180009
is
extremely unlikely.

Other signs commonly|74964007|72670004
associated|47429007
with meningitis|7180009
include|55919000
photophobia|409668002
(intolerance|29544009
to bright light|221668007|56242006|221668007|371268001
)
and
phonophobia|313387002
(intolerance|29544009
to loud noises|24547000
).

Small children often|255507004|410601007|70232002|255507004|160499008|70232002
do
not
exhibit
the aforementioned symptoms,
and
may
only
be
irritable|55929007
and
look|386548000
unwell.

The fontanelle|79361005|272681004
(
the soft spot|37378003|23840004
on the top|421812003
of a baby's head|418119000|69536005|418119000|302548004
)
can
bulge|442672001
in infants|418119000
aged|424144002|105436006
up to 6 months.|258706009

Other features|74964007
that
distinguish
meningitis|7180009
from less severe illnesses|276139006|24484000|39104002|263796003|24484000|39104002
in young children|84422007|410601007|84422007|160499008
are
leg pain,|10601006
cold extremities,|15336001
and
an abnormal skin color.[7][8]|47415006|119325001|47415006|39937001|47415006|181469002|263654008|276323006|263654008|364533002

Nuchal rigidity|405947006
occurs|272120004
in 70%
of bacterial meningitis|95883001
in adults.|133936004

Other signs|74964007|72670004
of meningism|437986008
include|55919000
the presence|386397008
of positive Kernig's sign|124743003
or
Brudzi?ski sign.|52773007|72670004

Kernig's sign|39051003
is
assessed
with the person|125676002
lying|40199007|255576009
supine,|40199007
with the hip|29836001|85710004
and
knee|304679005|49076000|361291001|72696002
flexed|9964006
to 90 degrees.|260312003|260345003|260315001

In a person|125676002
with a positive Kernig's sign,|124743003
pain|22253000
limits|255469002
passive extension|255536004
of the knee.|304679005|49076000|361291001|72696002

A positive Brudzinski's sign|258758003|72670004|10828004|72670004
occurs|272120004
when
flexion|9964006
of the neck|45048000|302550007
causes|134198009
involuntary flexion|9964006
of the knee|304679005|49076000|361291001|72696002
and
hip.|29836001|85710004

Although
Kernig's sign|39051003
and
Brudzinski's sign|72670004
are
both
commonly
used|394850002
to
screen|20135006|360156006
for meningitis,|7180009
the sensitivity|35209006|365705006
of these tests|269814003|272393004
is
limited.|255469002

They
do
,
however,
have
very good specificity|260358002|20572008|69658003
for meningitis|7180009
:
the signs rarely|72670004|103356009
occur|272120004
in other diseases.|74964007|64572001

Another test,|269814003|272393004
known|36692007
as the "jolt accentuation maneuver"
helps
determine
whether meningitis|7180009
is
present|52101004|246105001
in those reporting fever|223458004|386661006
and
headache.|25064002

A person|125676002
is
asked to rapidly|418694008
rotate|263861005
the head horizontally|69536005|302548004
;
if
this
does
not
make
the headache worse, meningitis|25064002|230993007|7180009|25064002|390772001|7180009|25064002|231877006|7180009
is
unlikely.[6]

Meningitis|7180009
caused|23981006|134198009
by the bacterium _Neisseria meningitidis_|409822003|17872004
(
known|36692007
as "meningococcal meningitis"|192644005
)
can
be
differentiated|263933003
from meningitis|7180009
with other causes|74964007|134198009
by a rapidly|418694008
spreading|410677005
petechial rash,|423716004
which
may
precede|236874000
other symptoms.|74964007

The rash|271807003
consists
of numerous small, irregular purple|260396001|255507004|49608001|264374004
or
red spots|386713009|271807003|386713009|285305004|371240000|271807003|371240000|285305004
("petechiae"|423716004
)
on the trunk,|22943007|262225004
lower extremities,|61685007
mucous membranes,|313268005
conjuctiva,
and
(occasionally
)
the palms|107631008
of the hands|85562004
or
soles|57999000
of the feet.|56459004|259051005

The rash|271807003
is
typically non-blanching
;
the redness|386713009|371240000
does
not
disappear
when
pressed
with a finger|7569003|302541005
or
a glass tumbler.|32039001

Although
this rash|271807003
is
not necessarily
present|52101004|246105001
in meningococcal meningitis,|192644005
it
is
relatively specific|69658003
for the disease|64572001
;
it
does
,
however,
occasionally
occur|272120004
in meningitis|7180009
due to other bacteria.|74964007|409822003

Other clues|74964007
on the cause|134198009
of meningitis|7180009
may
be
the skin signs|119325001|72670004|39937001|72670004|181469002|72670004
of hand,|85562004|302539009
foot and mouth disease|83894002
and
genital herpes,|33839006
both
of which
are
associated|47429007
with various forms|256220008|246176004
of viral meningitis.[10]|58170007

Additional problems|260364009|55607006
may
occur|272120004
in the early stage|264499004|21191007|264499004|371508000|264499004|261612004
of the illness.|39104002

These
may
require
specific treatment,|69658003|276239002|69658003|416118004
and
sometimes
indicate|410535002
severe illness|24484000|39104002
or
worse prognosis.|230993007|20481000|390772001|20481000|231877006|20481000

The infection
may
trigger|410658008
sepsis,|105592009|91302008
a systemic inflammatory response syndrome|238150007
of falling blood pressure,|1912002|75367002|1912002|392570002|1912002|386536003
fast heart rate,|3424008
high|75540009|371879000
or
abnormally low temperature,|285686007|371880002|105723007|371880002|246508008
and
rapid breathing.|271823003

Very low blood pressure|260358002|45007003
may
occur|272120004
at an early stage,|264499004|21191007|264499004|371508000|264499004|261612004
especially
but
not exclusively
in meningococcal meningitis|192644005
;
this
may
lead|88488004
to insufficient blood supply|71978007|87612001|425398004|71978007|119273009|425398004|423437008|87612001|425398004|423437008|119273009|425398004
to other organs.|74964007|410653004

Disseminated intravascular coagulation,|67406007
the excessive activation|260378005
of blood clotting,|75753009
may
obstruct|263821009
blood flow|58190003
to organs|410653004
and
paradoxically
increase|260366006
the bleeding risk.|131148009|30207005

Gangrene|372070002
of limbs|66019005
can
occur|272120004
in meningococcal disease.|23511006

Severe meningococcal|24484000|419013009
and
pneumococcal infections|16814004
may
result|394617004
in hemorrhaging|131148009
of the adrenal glands,|23451007
leading|236874000
to Waterhouse-Friderichsen syndrome,|36102002
which
is
often fatal.[11]|70232002|399166001

The brain tissue|256865009|280369009
may
swell,|423666004|442672001
pressure|279046003|13543005|257893003
inside the skull|89546000
may
increase|260366006
and
the swollen brain|442672001|12738006|442672001|258335003
may
herniate
through the skull base.|31467002

This
may
be
noticed
by a decreasing level|260371004|258395000|260371004|276625007
of consciousness,|106167005
loss
of the pupillary light reflex,|40137007|400921004
and
abnormal posturing.|43029002

The inflammation|257552002
of the brain tissue|256865009|280369009
may
also
obstruct|263821009
the normal flow|17621005|258744000
of CSF
around the brain|12738006|258335003
(hydrocephalus.|230745008

Seizures|91175000
may
occur|272120004
for various reasons|256220008|410666004
;
in children,|410601007|160499008
seizures|91175000
are
common|72906007
in the early stages|264499004|261612004
of meningitis|7180009
(
in 30%
of cases|398241000|413769002
)
and
do
not necessarily
indicate|410535002
an underlying cause.|134198009

Seizures|91175000
may
result|394617004
from increased pressure|51590001
and
from areas|42798000
of inflammation|257552002
in the brain tissue.|256865009|280369009

Focal seizures|29753000
(seizures|91175000

or
part|260726005
of the body|279495008|123037004
)
,
persistent seizures,|91175000
late-onset seizures|260383002|77374008|91175000
and
those that
are
difficult to|52925006
control|31509003
with medication|410942007
indicate|410535002
a poorer long-term outcome.[1]|11403006|394617004|255351007|394617004

Inflammation|257552002
of the meninges|363824000
may
lead|88488004
to abnormalities|276654001
of the cranial nerves,|25238003
a group|261586004|160481000|389109008
of nerves|3057000
arising|68727004
from the brain stem|15926001|180925009
that
supply|425398004
the head|69536005|302548004
and
neck area|45048000|42798000|302550007|42798000
and
which
control|31509003

among other functions,|74964007|246464006
eye movement,|373642008
facial muscles,|25903009
and
hearing.|47078008|118230007

Visual symptoms|162274004
and

of the brain.[1][4]|12738006|258335003

Meningitis|7180009
is
typically
caused|23981006|134198009
by an infection
with microorganisms.|264395009

Most infections
are
due to viruses,|49872002
[6]
with bacteria,|409822003
fungi,|414561005
and
protozoa|417396000
being
the next most common causes.|18769003|72906007|134198009|255260001|72906007|134198009

It
may
also
result|394617004
from various non-infectious causes.|256220008|134198009

The term _aseptic meningitis_ refers|301770000|439980006
to cases|398241000|413769002
of meningitis|7180009
in which
no bacterial infection|301811001
can
be
demonstrated.

This type|261664005
of meningitis|7180009
is
usually
caused|23981006|134198009
by viruses,|49872002
but
it
may
be
due to bacterial infection|301811001
that
has
already
been
partially
treated|28995006
,
when
bacteria|409822003
disappear
from the meninges,|363824000
or
pathogens|264418008
infect
a space
adjacent|18769003
to the meninges|363824000
(e.g.|258795003

sinusitis.|36971009

Endocarditis|56819008

may
cause|23981006|134198009
aseptic meningitis.|301770000

Aseptic meningitis|301770000
may
also
result|394617004
from infection
with spirochetes,|115169007|419328001|418489004

be
encountered
in cerebral malaria|53622003
(malaria|248437004

from freshwater sources.[2]|5024000|260753009

The types|261664005
of bacteria|409822003
that
cause|23981006|134198009
bacterial meningitis|95883001
vary
according to the infected individual's age group.|125676002|424144002|261586004|125676002|424144002|160481000|125676002|424144002|389109008|385435006|424144002|261586004|385435006|424144002|160481000|385435006|424144002|389109008

Recent skull trauma potentially|82070008|89546000
allows
nasal cavity bacteria to|279549004|409822003|263481003|409822003
enter|417985001
the meningeal space.|32111004

Similarly,
devices|303607000|49062001
in the brain|12738006|258335003
and
meninges,|363824000
such as cerebral shunts,|442119001|257351008|125319009
extraventricular drains|32712000
or
Ommaya reservoirs,|118426006
carry|288345009
an increased risk|35105006|30207005|260366006|30207005
of meningitis.|7180009

In these cases,|398241000|413769002
the persons|125676002
are
more likely to|242762006|2931005
be
infected
with Staphylococci,|65119002
Pseudomonas,|5274006
and
other Gram-negative bacteria.|74964007|81325006

These pathogens|264418008
are
also
associated|47429007
with meningitis|7180009
in people|125676002
with an impaired immune system.|260379002|116003000|40226000|116003000

An infection
in the head|69536005|302548004
and
neck area,|45048000|42798000|302550007|42798000
such as otitis media|65363002
or
mastoiditis,|52404001
can
lead|88488004
to meningitis|7180009
in a small proportion|255507004|8212001
of people.|125676002

Recipients
of cochlear implants|43252007|359612003
for hearing loss|343087000|15188001

more
a pneumococcal meningitis.[13]|51169003

Tuberculous meningitis,|58437007
which
is
meningitis|7180009
caused|23981006|134198009
by _Mycobacterium tuberculosis_,|113861009
is
more common|242762006|72906007
in people|125676002
from countries|223369002
where tuberculosis|371569005
is
endemic,
but
is
also
encountered
in persons|125676002
with immune problems,|255386009|55607006
such as AIDS.[14]|62479008

Recurrent bacterial meningitis|255227004|95883001
may
be
caused|23981006|134198009
by persisting anatomical defects,|36298004|6920004
either
congenital|6160004|255399007
or
acquired,|255396000
or
by disorders|64572001
of the immune system.|116003000

Anatomical defects|36298004|6920004
allow
continuity|277052006
between the external environment|261074009|276339004
and
the nervous system.|25087005|278196006

The most common cause|4757001|72906007|134198009
of recurrent meningitis|255227004|7180009
is
a skull fracture,|71642004
[15] particularly
fractures|125605004
that
affect|4065008
the base
of the skull|89546000
or
extend|255590007
towards the sinuses|2095001
and
petrous pyramids.|25516004

Approximately 59%|26175008
of recurrent meningitis cases|255227004|7180009|398241000|255227004|7180009|413769002
are
due to such anatomical abnormalities,|417893002
36%
are
due to immune deficiencies|255386009|260372006|255386009|248325000
(
such as complement deficiency,|24743004
which
predisposes
especially
to recurrent meningococcal meningitis|255227004|192644005
)
,
and
5%|264706000|264605009
are
due to ongoing infections|255238004
in areas|42798000
adjacent|18769003
to the meninges.[15]|363824000

Viruses|49872002
that
cause|23981006|134198009
meningitis|7180009
include|55919000
enteroviruses,|243633006
Herpes simplex virus type 2|13687007
(
and
less commonly type 1|276139006|258191002|263796003|258191002
)
,
Varicella zoster virus|19551004
(
known|36692007
for causing chickenpox|23981006|38907003
and
shingles,|4740000
mumps virus,|50384007
HIV,|19030005|86406008|402916007
and
LCMV.[10]|82518003

There
are
a number|410680006|410681005
of risk factors|80943009
for fungal meningitis,|24321005
including|55919000
the use|277889008|419385000
of immunosuppressants|372823004
(
such as
after
organ transplantation,|410653004|263903005
HIV/AIDS,|19030005|62479008|86406008|62479008|402916007|62479008
[16]
and
the loss
of immunity|58915005
associated|47429007
with aging.|248280005

It
is
uncommon|103356009
in those with a normal immune system[18]|20401003|17621005|116003000|20401003|258744000|116003000|421463005|17621005|116003000|421463005|258744000|116003000
but
has
occurred|272120004
with medication contamination.|410942007

Symptom onset|77374008
is
typically more gradual,|255343009
with headaches|25064002
and
fever|386661006
being
present|52101004|246105001
for
at least
a couple
of weeks|258705008
before diagnosis.|439401001

The most common fungal meningitis|4757001|72906007|24321005
is
cryptococcal meningitis|14232007
due to _Cryptococcus neoformans_.|42386007|67168003

In Africa,|223498002
cryptococcal meningitis|14232007
is
estimated to|414135002
be
the most common cause|4757001|72906007|134198009
of meningitis [21]|7180009
and
it
accounts
for 20?25%|419607004
of AIDS-related deaths|62479008|272151006|419620001|62479008|272151006|268923008|62479008|262094002|419620001|62479008|262094002|268923008
in Africa.|223498002

Other common fungal agents|74964007|72906007|105897007
include|55919000
_Histoplasma capsulatum_,|62969002|56596006
_Coccidioides immitis_,|23439005
_Blastomyces dermatitidis_,|65615007
and
_Candida_ species.[17]|372381007

A parasitic cause|134198009
is
often|70232002
assumed
when
there
is
a predominance
of eosinophils|14793004|365601007
(
a type|261664005
of white blood cell|52501007
)
in the CSF.

The most common parasites|4757001|72906007|37763007
implicated
are
_Angiostrongylus cantonensis_,|48708001
_Gnathostoma spinigerum_,|30429007
_Schistosoma_,|53583001
as well as
the conditions cysticercosis,|260905004|105684008
toxocariasis,|406619001
baylisascariasis,
paragonimiasis,|30369007
and
a number|410680006|410681005
of rarer infections|84638005|103356009
and
noninfective conditions.[23]|260905004|264657009

Meningitis|7180009
may
occur|272120004
as the result|394617004
of several non-infectious causes|261028005|134198009
:
spread|410677005
of cancer|363346000|372087000
to the meninges|363824000
(_malignant|21594007
or
neoplastic meningitis_|230156002|426128009
)
[24]
and
certain drugs|17162000|410942007
(mainly non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs,|372665008
antibiotics|255631004
and
intravenous immunoglobulins.|350344000

It
may
also
be
caused|23981006|134198009
by several inflammatory conditions,|261028005|260905004
such as sarcoidosis|31541009
(
which
is
then called neurosarcoidosis,|230193008
connective tissue disorders|105969002
such as systemic lupus erythematosus,|55464009
and
certain forms|17162000|246176004
of vasculitis|31996006
(inflammatory conditions|260905004
of the blood vessel wall|59820001|224727009|361097006|224727009
)
,
such as Beh?et's disease.|64572001

Epidermoid cysts|419603000
and
dermoid cysts|72277008
may
cause|23981006|134198009
meningitis|7180009
by releasing irritant matter|129299003|412453003|129299003|263789000
into the subarachnoid space.|35951006

Mollaret's meningitis|81981006
is
a syndrome
of recurring episodes|246455001|272128006|255227004|272128006
of aseptic meningitis|301770000
;
it
is
thought to|88952004
be
caused|23981006|134198009
by herpes simplex virus type 2.|13687007

Rarely,|103356009
migraine|37796009
may
cause|23981006|134198009
meningitis,|7180009
but
this diagnosis|439401001
is
usually only
made
when
other causes|74964007|134198009
have
been
eliminated.[2]

The meninges|363824000
comprise
three membranes|421291004|83097008
that,
together with the cerebrospinal fluid,|65216001
enclose|68947003
and
protect
the brain|12738006|258335003
and
spinal cord|2748008|180959008
(
the central nervous system.|21483005|278199004

The pia mater|23180006
is
a very|260358002
delicate
impermeable membrane|83097008
that firmly
adheres|102491009
to the surface|410678000
of the brain,|12738006|258335003
following|255260001
all the minor contours.|410599005|255606000

The arachnoid mater|75042008
(so|223528007
named|27468005
because of its spider-web-like appearance|420814007|76640006|386548000|420814007|76640006|255412001
)
is
a loosely
fitting|122467006
sac
on top|421812003
of the pia mater.|23180006

The subarachnoid space|35951006
separates|13184001|263869007
the arachnoid|75042008
and
pia mater membranes|23180006|83097008
and
is
filled
with cerebrospinal fluid.|65216001

The outermost membrane,|83097008
the dura mater,|18545000
is
a thick durable membrane,|246703001|83097008
which
is
attached|102491009
to
both
the arachnoid membrane|75042008|83097008
and
the skull.|89546000

In bacterial meningitis,|95883001
bacteria|409822003
reach|282679008
the meninges|363824000
by one|421379005
of two main routes|420797005|63161005
:
through the bloodstream
or
through direct contact|255589003|11723008|255589003|70862002
between the meninges|363824000
and
either
the nasal cavity|279549004|263481003
or
the skin.|119325001|39937001|181469002

In most cases,|398241000|413769002
meningitis|7180009
follows|367409002
invasion|370052007
of the bloodstream
by organisms|410653004
that
live|419749002
upon mucous|49909006|255433005
surfaces|410678000
such as the nasal cavity.|279549004|263481003

This
is
often in turn|70232002|282987006
preceded|236874000
by viral infections,|34014006
which break down|263690001
the normal barrier|17621005|258744000
provided
by the mucous surfaces.|49909006|410678000|255433005|410678000

Once bacteria|409822003
have
entered|417985001
the bloodstream,
they
enter|417985001
the subarachnoid space|35951006
in places|257557008
where the blood?brain barrier|20245001
is
vulnerable?
such as the choroid plexus.|80621003|264450003

Meningitis|7180009
occurs|272120004
in 25%
of newborns|133933007
with bloodstream infections|431193003
due to group B streptococci|43492007
;
this phenomenon
is
less common|276139006|72906007|263796003|72906007
in adults.|133936004

Direct contamination|255589003
of the cerebrospinal fluid|65216001
may
arise|68727004
from indwelling devices,|255307003|303607000|255307003|49062001
skull fractures,|71642004
or
infections
of the nasopharynx|264105008|181200003
or
the nasal sinuses|2095001
that
have
formed|35810008
a tract
with the subarachnoid space|35951006
(
see|281004000
above|261183002
)
;
occasionally,
congenital defects|276654001
of the dura mater|18545000
can
be
identified.[1]|7882003

The large-scale inflammation|255509001|19892000|257552002|255509001|278111002|257552002
that
occurs|272120004
in the subarachnoid space|35951006
during meningitis|7180009
is
not
a direct result|255589003|394617004
of bacterial infection|301811001
but
can
rather largely
be
attributed|246061005
to the response
of the immune system|116003000
to the entry
of bacteria|409822003
into the central nervous system.|21483005|278199004

When
components|246093002
of the bacterial cell membrane|285297004|83097008
are
identified|7882003
by the immune cells|255386009|4421005
of the brain|12738006|258335003
(astrocytes|78399007
and
microglia,|63483002
they
respond
by releasing large amounts|129299003|255509001|107651007
of cytokines,|75777003
hormone-like mediators|87568004
that
recruit
other immune cells|74964007|255386009|4421005
and
stimulate
other tissues to|74964007|85756007
participate
in an immune response.|35024006

The blood?brain barrier|20245001
becomes
more permeable,|242762006|82540007
leading|236874000
to "vasogenic" cerebral edema|230759001
(swelling|423666004|442672001
of the brain|12738006|258335003
due to fluid leakage|32457005|76676007|33463005|76676007|255765007|76676007|76676007
from blood vessels|59820001
).

Large numbers|255509001|410680006|255509001|410681005
of white blood cells|767002|52501007
enter|417985001
the CSF,
causing|23981006
inflammation|257552002
of the meninges|363824000
and
leading|236874000
to "interstitial" edema|423666004
(swelling|423666004|442672001
due to fluid|32457005|33463005|255765007
between the cells|4421005
).

In addition,|260364009
the walls|224727009
of the blood vessels|59820001
themselves
become
inflamed
(cerebral vasculitis|427020007
)
,
which
leads|88488004|236874000
to decreased blood flow|21762000
and
a third type|70905002|261664005
of edema,|423666004
"cytotoxic" edema.|423666004

The three forms|421291004|246176004
of cerebral edema|2032001
all
lead|88488004
to increased intracranial pressure|271719001
;
together with the lowered blood pressure often|45007003|70232002
encountered
in acute infection,|63171007
this means|255586005
that
it
is
harder|72505002
for blood to|87612001|119273009
enter|417985001
the brain,|12738006|258335003
consequently brain cells|12738006|4421005|258335003|4421005
are
deprived
of oxygen|24099007
and
undergo
apoptosis|20663007
(automated cell death.[1]|8359006|4421005|419620001|8359006|4421005|268923008|8359006|362837007|419620001|8359006|362837007|268923008

It
is
recognized
that administration|413454004|416118004
of antibiotics|255631004
may
initially|884001
worsen|230993007|390772001
the process|415178003
outlined
above,|261183002
by increasing|260369004
the amount|107651007
of bacterial cell membrane products|111117008|53982002
released|68776005|129299003
through the destruction|64597002
of bacteria.|409822003

Particular treatments,|276239002
such as the use|277889008|419385000
of corticosteroids,|79440004
are
aimed
at dampening
the immune system's response|35024006|246333005
to this phenomenon.[1][4]

In someone
suspected|415684004
of
having
meningitis,|7180009
blood tests|252275004
are
performed|398166005
for markers
of inflammation|257552002
(e.g.|258795003

C-reactive protein,|61425002|55235003
complete blood count,|26604007
as well as
blood cultures.[3][27]|30088009

The most important test|4757001|269814003|4757001|4757001|272393004
in identifying|7882003
or
ruling out meningitis|10828004|7180009
is
analysis|272389005
of the cerebrospinal fluid|65216001
through lumbar puncture|277762005|265232001
(LP,|277762005|7820009
spinal tap|277762005|265232001
).

However,
lumbar puncture|277762005|265232001
is
contraindicated|410536001
if there
is
a mass|300848003|118538004
in the brain (tumor|126952004
or
abscess|128477000
)
or
the intracranial pressure (ICP)|250844005
is
elevated,|75540009
as
it
may
lead|88488004
to brain herniation.|49453006

If
someone
is
at risk|410519009
for
either
a mass|300848003|118538004
or
raised ICP|260399008|235888006
(recent head injury,|82070008|69536005|82070008|302548004|6493001|82271004
a known immune system problem,|36692007|116003000|55607006
localizing|255471002
neurological signs,|1199008|72670004
or
evidence|18669006
on examination|5880005
of a raised ICP|260399008|235888006
)
,
a CT
or
MRI scan|113091000|373205008|113091000
is
recommended
prior to the lumbar puncture.|277762005|265232001

This applies|410618006|417924000
in 45%
of all adult cases.|133936004|398241000|133936004|413769002

If
a CT
or
MRI|113091000
is
required
before LP,|277762005|7820009
or
if LP|277762005|7820009
proves|277025001
difficult, professional guidelines|52925006
suggest
that antibiotics|255631004
should
be
administered|418283001
first to|255216001|232714002
prevent
delay in treatment,[3] especially|276239002|416118004
if
this
may
be
longer|255511005
than 30 minutes.|259030007

Often,|70232002
CT
or
MRI scans|113091000
are
performed|398166005
at a later
stage|21191007|371508000|261612004
to
assess
for complications|116223007
of meningitis.[1]|7180009

In severe forms|24484000|246176004
of meningitis,|7180009
monitoring|302805002
of blood electrolytes|87612001|86355000|119273009|86355000
may
be
important
;
for example,
hyponatremia|89627008
is
common|72906007
in bacterial meningitis,|95883001
due to a combination|89780004
of factors,
including|55919000
dehydration,|34095006
the inappropriate excretion|63911002
of the antidiuretic hormone|71338005
(SIADH|55004003
)
,
or
overly aggressive intravenous fluid administration.[4][30]|61372001|14152002|32457005|61372001|14152002|33463005|61372001|14152002|255765007|61372001|14152002|61372001|118431008|413454004|61372001|118431008|416118004|14152002|32457005|14152002|33463005|14152002|255765007|14152002|118431008|413454004|118431008|416118004

A lumbar puncture|277762005|265232001
is
done
by positioning|226048001|246449006|229824005
the person,|125676002
usually
lying|40199007|255576009
on the side,|182353008
applying|410618006|417924000
local anesthetic,|386761002|373477003
and
inserting|257867005|421532009
a needle|79068005
into the dural sac|18545000
(
a sac
around the spinal cord|2748008|180959008
)
to
collect cerebrospinal fluid (CSF).|65216001

When
this
has
been
achieved
,
the "opening pressure"|56116003|279046003|56116003|13543005|56116003|257893003
of the CSF
is
measured|258104002
using|260676000
a manometer.

The pressure|279046003|13543005|257893003
is
normally
between 6
and
18 cm water|11713004|119318008
(cmH2O|259019009
)
;[28]
in bacterial meningitis|95883001
the pressure|279046003|13543005|257893003
is
usually
elevated.|75540009

In cryptococcal meningitis,|14232007
intracranial pressure|250844005
is
markedly|46998006
elevated.|75540009

The initial appearance|884001|386548000|884001|255412001|232714002|386548000|232714002|255412001
of the fluid|32457005|33463005|255765007
may
prove|277025001
an indication|410666004
of the nature|277302009
of the infection
:
cloudy CSF|81858005
indicates|410535002
higher levels|75540009|258395000|371879000|258395000
of protein,|88878007
white|413773004|185984009|371251000
and
red blood cells|14089001|41898006|258759006|126242007
and/or
bacteria,|409822003
and
therefore
may
suggest
bacterial meningitis.[3]|95883001

The CSF sample|123038009
is
examined|64049009
for presence|386397008
and
types|261664005
of white blood cells,|767002|52501007
red blood cells,|14089001|41898006|258759006|126242007
protein content|88878007|276824008
and
glucose level.|36048009|365811003

Gram staining|385484003
of the sample|123038009
may
demonstrate
bacteria|409822003
in bacterial meningitis,|95883001
but
absence|2667000|418560003
of bacteria|409822003
does
not
exclude|77765009
bacterial meningitis|95883001
as
they
are
only
seen
in 60%
of cases|398241000|413769002
;
this figure
is
reduced|260400001
by a further 20%|46053002
if
antibiotics|255631004
were
administered|418283001
before the sample|123038009
was
taken.|419652001

Gram staining|385484003
is
also less reliable
in particular infections
such as listeriosis.|4241002

Microbiological culture|252398009|61594008
of the sample|123038009
is
more sensitive|242762006|83185005
(
it
identifies|7882003
the organism|410653004
in 70?85%
of cases|398241000|413769002
)
but
results|394617004
can
take up|419652001|255532002|419652001|353734004
to 48 hours to|255249005
become
available.|103328004

The type|261664005
of white blood cell predominantly|52501007
present|52101004|246105001
(
see|281004000
table|86407004
)
indicates|410535002
whether meningitis|7180009
is
bacterial|409822003
(usually neutrophil-predominant|116712007
)
or
viral
(usually lymphocyte-predominant|56972008
)
,
[3]|260313008
although
at the beginning|255395001
of the disease|64572001
this
is
not always
a reliable indicator.

Less commonly,|276139006|263796003
eosinophils|14793004|365601007
predominate|83296008
,
suggesting
parasitic
or
fungal etiology,|414561005|134198009
among others.[23]|74964007|264657009

The concentration|82742001
of glucose|67079006|72191006
in CSF
is
normally
above 40%|259031006
of that
in blood.|87612001|119273009

In bacterial meningitis|95883001
it
is
typically lower|261122009
;
the CSF glucose level|365815007
is
therefore
divided|422033008
by the blood glucose|33747003
(CSF glucose|69125006
to serum glucose ratio|22569008|118586006
).

A ratio ?0.4|118586006
is
indicative
of bacterial meningitis|95883001
;[28]
in the newborn,|133933007|46068001|255407002
glucose levels|365811003
in CSF
are
normally higher,|75540009|371879000
and
a ratio|118586006
below 0.6
(60%
)
is
therefore
considered
abnormal.|263654008

High levels|75540009|258395000|371879000|258395000
of lactate|83036002
in CSF
indicate|410535002
a higher likelihood|75540009|2931005|371879000|2931005
of bacterial meningitis,|95883001
as
does
a higher white blood cell count.|75540009|767002|75540009|365630000|371879000|767002|371879000|365630000

If lactate levels|425954005
are
less
than 35 mg/dl|258797006
and
the person|125676002
has
not previously received antibiotics then|255631004
this
may
rule|10828004
out bacterial meningitis.[32]|255529000|95883001

Various other specialized tests|256220008|67995009|269814003|256220008|67995009|272393004|256220008|269814003|256220008|272393004
may
be
used|394850002
to
distinguish
between different types|263735002|261664005
of meningitis.|7180009

A latex agglutination test|43657008
may
be
positive|258758003|10828004
in meningitis|7180009
caused|23981006|134198009
by _Streptococcus pneumoniae_,|9861002
_Neisseria meningitidis_,|17872004
_Haemophilus influenzae_,|44470000
_Escherichia coli_|112283007
and
_group B streptococci_|43492007
;
its routine use|50811001|277889008|50811001|419385000
is
not
encouraged
as
it rarely|103356009
leads|88488004|236874000
to changes|243326001|263703002
in treatment,|52101004|276239002|52101004|416118004|18720000|276239002|18720000|416118004
but
it
may
be
used|394850002
if other tests|74964007|269814003|74964007|272393004
are
not diagnostic.|439401001|261004008

Similarly,
the limulus lysate test|269814003|272393004
may
be
positive|258758003|10828004
in meningitis|7180009
caused|23981006|134198009
by Gram-negative bacteria,|81325006
but
it
is
of limited use|255469002|277889008|255469002|419385000
unless
other tests|74964007|269814003|74964007|272393004
have
been
unhelpful.

Polymerase chain reaction (PCR)|258066000
is
a technique|272394005
used|394850002
to
amplify
small traces|255507004|260405006
of bacterial DNA|409822003|24851008
in order to
detect|260373001
the presence|386397008
of bacterial|409822003
or
viral DNA|24851008
in cerebrospinal fluid|65216001
;
it
is
a highly sensitive|255383001
and
specific test|69658003|269814003|69658003|69658003|272393004
since
only trace amounts|50607009|260405006|420295001|260405006
of the infecting agent's DNA|260872001|24851008
is
required.

It
may
identify|7882003
bacteria|409822003
in bacterial meningitis|95883001
and
may
assist|116697009|119265000
in distinguishing
the various causes|256220008|134198009
of viral meningitis|58170007
(enterovirus,|243633006
herpes simplex virus 2|13687007
and
mumps|240526004
in those
not
vaccinated
for this
).

Serology|68793005
(identification|286672002|7882003
of antibodies|68498002
to viruses|49872002
)
may
be
useful
in viral meningitis.|58170007

If tuberculous meningitis|58437007
is
suspected,|415684004
the sample|123038009
is
processed|415178003
for Ziehl-Neelsen stain,|255813003|406979008
which
has
a low sensitivity,|62482003|35209006|62482003|365705006|371880002|35209006|371880002|365705006
and
tuberculosis culture,|371569005|252398009|371569005|61594008
which
takes|419652001
a long time|255511005|410669006
to process|415178003

Diagnosis|439401001
of cryptococcal meningitis|14232007
can
be
made
at low cost|62482003|371880002
using|260676000
an India ink stain|406972004
of the CSF
;
however,
testing|272393004
for cryptococcal antigen|103094002
in blood|87612001|119273009
or
CSF
is
more sensitive, particularly|242762006|83185005
in people|125676002
with AIDS.[33][34]|62479008|264667004

A diagnostic|439401001|261004008
and
therapeutic difficulty|262202000|371157007
is
"partially treated meningitis",|28995006|7180009
where there
are
meningitis symptoms|7180009
after receiving antibiotics|255631004
(
such as
for presumptive sinusitis.|36971009

When
this happens,
CSF findings|404684003
may
resemble
those
of viral meningitis,|58170007
but
antibiotic treatment|255631004|276239002|255631004|416118004
may
need|410525008|103325001
to
be
continued|255238004
until
there
is
definitive positive evidence|261002007|258758003|18669006|261002007|10828004|18669006
of a viral cause|134198009
(e.g.|258795003

a positive enterovirus PCR|258758003|243633006|258066000|258758003|243633006|103338009|10828004|243633006|258066000|10828004|243633006|103338009
).[10]

Meningitis|7180009
can
be
diagnosed|439401001
after death|419620001|268923008
has
occurred.|272120004

The findings|404684003
from a post mortem|168461002
are
usually
a widespread inflammation|85333001|257552002
of the pia mater|23180006
and
arachnoid layers|75042008
of the meninges.|363824000

Neutrophil granulocytes|116712007
tend
to
have
migrated
to the cerebrospinal fluid|65216001
and
the base
of the brain,|12738006|258335003
along
with cranial nerves|25238003
and
the spinal cord,|2748008|180959008
may
be
surrounded|355648006
with pus ?|11311000|119323008
as
may
the meningeal vessels.[35]|363824000|59820001

For some
causes|134198009
of meningitis,|7180009
protection
can
be
provided
in the long term
through vaccination,
or
in the short term
with antibiotics.|255631004

Some behavioral measures|844005|246445000|844005|367346004
may
also
be
effective.|255403003|254648000

Bacterial|409822003
and
viral meningitis|58170007
are
contagious
;
however,
neither
are
as
contagious
as the common cold|82272006|54150009
or
flu.|6142004

Both
can
be
transmitted|60117003|258150004
through droplets
of respiratory secretions|423662002
during close contact|29179001|11723008|29179001|70862002
such as kissing,|78962002
sneezing|162367006
or
coughing|272039006
on someone,
but
cannot
be
spread|410677005
by only|50607009|420295001
breathing|14910006|258162000
the air|417696007
where a person|125676002
with meningitis|7180009
has
been.

Viral meningitis|58170007
is
typically
caused|23981006|134198009
by enteroviruses,|243633006
and
is
most commonly|4757001
spread|410677005
through fecal contamination.|39477002

The risk|30207005
of infection
can
be
decreased|1250004|260400001|260371004
by changing|243326001|263703002
the behavior|844005
that
led|88488004|236874000
to transmission.|258150004

Since
the 1980s,
many countries|223369002
have
included immunization|55919000|127785005|55919000
against _Haemophilus influenzae_ type B|103442008
in their routine childhood vaccination schemes.|50811001|68433009

This
has
practically
eliminated
this pathogen|264418008
as a cause|134198009
of meningitis|7180009
in young children|84422007|410601007|84422007|160499008
in those countries.|223369002

In the countries|223369002
where the disease burden|64572001
is
highest, however,|75540009|371879000
the vaccine|398827000
is
still too expensive.

Similarly,
immunization|127785005
against mumps|240526004
has
led|88488004|236874000
to a sharp fall|410707003|1912002
in the number|410680006|410681005
of cases|398241000|413769002
of mumps meningitis,|44201003
which
prior to vaccination
occurred|272120004
in 15%
of all cases|398241000|413769002
of mumps.[10]|240526004

Meningococcus vaccines|424891007
exist
against
groups|261586004|160481000
A,
C,
W135|262274003
and
Y.

In countries|223369002
where the vaccine|398827000
for meningococcus group C|17872004|261587008
was
introduced|127487003
,
cases|398241000|413769002
caused|23981006|134198009
by this pathogen|264418008
have
decreased|1250004|260400001|260371004
substantially.

A quadrivalent vaccine now|398827000
exists
,
which
combines|20909006
all four vaccines.|421534005|398827000

Immunization|127785005
with the ACW135Y vaccine|398827000
against four strains|421534005|48532005|421534005|276768000
is
now
a visa requirement
for taking part|419652001|260726005
in Hajj.

Development|278923009
of a vaccine|398827000
against group B meningococci|261586004|17872004|160481000|17872004|389109008|17872004
has
proved|277025001
much more difficult,|242762006|52925006|4757001|52925006
as
its surface proteins|410678000|88878007
(
which
would
normally
be
used|394850002
to
make
a vaccine|398827000
)
only
elicit|263516000
a weak response|13791008|260407003
from the immune system,|116003000
or
cross-react|65145006
with normal human proteins.|17621005|278412004|88878007|258744000|278412004|88878007

Still,
some countries|223369002
(New Zealand,|223625001
Cuba,|223701004
Norway|223673006
and
Chile|223716001
have
developed vaccines|398827000
against local strains|255470001|48532005|255470001|276768000
of group B meningococci|261586004|17872004|160481000|17872004|389109008|17872004
;
some
have
shown
good results|20572008|394617004
and
are
used|394850002
in local immunization schedules.|255470001|127785005|416151008|255470001|127785005|410538000|255470001|127785005|416774000|255470001|416151008|255470001|410538000|255470001|416774000

In Africa,|223498002
until
recently,|6493001
the approach
for prevention|169443000
and
control|31509003
of meningococcal epidemics|419013009
was
based|418836005
on early detection|264499004
of the disease|64572001
and
emergency reactive mass vaccination|25876001|11214006|300848003|25876001|11214006|118538004
of the at-risk population|410519009|385436007|410519009|389109008
with bivalent A/C
or
trivalent
A/C/W135 polysaccharide vaccines,|262274003|71544008|398827000
[41]
though
the introduction|107733003
of MenAfriVac
(meningococcus group A vaccine|424891007|272414007
)
has
demonstrated effectiveness|255403003
in young people|84422007|125676002
and
has
been
described
as a model
for product development partnerships|278923009
in resource-limited settings.[42][43]|255469002

Routine vaccination|50811001
against _Streptococcus pneumoniae_|9861002
with the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV),|398730001|76698003
which
is
active|55561003
against seven common serotypes|420359007|72906007|276770009
of this pathogen,|264418008
significantly
reduces|260400001
the incidence
of pneumococcal meningitis.|51169003

The pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine,|70447008
which
covers|255334000
23 strains,|264657009|48532005|264657009|276768000
is
only
administered|418283001
to certain groups|17162000|261586004|17162000|160481000
(e.g.|258795003

those
who
have
had
a splenectomy,|234319005
the surgical removal|118292001|128303001|128304007
of the spleen|78961009|181279003
)
;
it
does
not
elicit|263516000
a significant immune response|386134007|35024006
in all recipients,
e.g.|258795003

small children.|255507004|410601007|255507004|160499008

Childhood vaccination|68433009
with Bacillus Calmette-Gu?rin|44762009|1017006
has
been
reported|229059009|223458004
to significantly
reduce|260400001
the rate
of tuberculous meningitis,|58437007
but
its waning effectiveness|255403003
in adulthood|41847000
has
prompted
a search
for a better vaccine.[37]|3442003|398827000

Short-term antibiotic prophylaxis|422181004
is
another method|260686004|272394005
of prevention,|169443000
particularly
of meningococcal meningitis.|192644005

In cases|398241000|413769002
of meningococcal meningitis,|192644005
prophylactic treatment|169443000
of close contacts|29179001|11723008|29179001|70862002
with antibiotics|255631004
(e.g.|258795003

rifampicin,|387159009
ciprofloxacin|392412000
or
ceftriaxone|372670001
can
reduce|260400001
their risk|30207005
of contracting|78558002
the condition,|260905004
but
does
not
protect
against future infections.

Resistance|30714006
to rifampicin|387159009
has
been
noted
to
increase|260366006
after use,|277889008|419385000
which
has
caused|23981006|134198009
some to
recommend
considering other agents.|260872001

While
antibiotics|255631004
are
frequently|70232002
used|394850002
in an attempt to
prevent
meningitis|7180009
in those with a basilar skull fracture there|20401003|24063002|421463005|24063002
is
insufficient evidence to|71978007|18669006|423437008|18669006
determine
whether
this
is
beneficial
or
harmful.

This applies|410618006|417924000
to those with|20401003|421463005
or
without a CSF leak.[46]|87952002

Meningitis|7180009
is
potentially life-threatening|224130005
and
has
a high mortality rate|75540009|409651001|371879000|409651001
if
untreated|25265005
;[3]|260313008
delay
in treatment|52101004|276239002|52101004|416118004|18720000|276239002|18720000|416118004
has
been
associated|47429007
with a poorer outcome.|11403006|394617004|255351007|394617004

Thus,
treatment|276239002|416118004
with wide-spectrum antibiotics|90522003|255631004
should
not
be
delayed
while
confirmatory tests|269814003|272393004
are
being
conducted.|844005

If meningococcal disease|23511006
is
suspected|415684004
in primary care,|63161005|261424001
guidelines
recommend
that benzylpenicillin|78507004
be
administered|418283001
before transfer|302265009
to hospital.|285201006

Intravenous fluids|118431008
should
be
administered|418283001
if hypotension|45007003
(low blood pressure|45007003
)
or
shock|27942005
are
present.|52101004|246105001

Given|419582001
that meningitis|7180009
can
cause|23981006|134198009
a number|410680006|410681005
of early severe complications,|30593001|24484000
regular medical review|17854005|74188005
is
recommended to
identify|7882003
these complications early[29]|30593001
and
to
admit|32485007
the person|125676002
to an intensive care unit|309904001
if
deemed necessary.[4]

Mechanical ventilation
may
be
needed|410525008|103325001
if
the level|258395000|276625007
of consciousness|106167005
is
very low,|260362008
or
if there
is
evidence|18669006
of respiratory failure.|409622000

If there
are
signs|72670004
of raised intracranial pressure,|271719001
measures|246445000|367346004
to
monitor|13288007
the pressure|279046003|13543005|257893003
may
be
taken|419652001
;
this
would
allow
the optimization
of the cerebral perfusion pressure|250846007
and
various treatments to|256220008|276239002
decrease|260400001|260370003
the intracranial pressure|250844005
with medication|410942007
(e.g.|258795003

mannitol.|387168006

Seizures|91175000
are
treated|28995006
with anticonvulsants.|255632006

Hydrocephalus|230745008
(obstructed flow|263821009
of CSF
)
may
require
insertion|71861002|257867005
of a temporary|14803004
or
long-term drainage device,|307488001|303607000|307488001|49062001|122462000|303607000|122462000|49062001
such as a cerebral shunt.[4]|442119001|257351008|125319009

Empiric antibiotics|255631004
(treatment|276239002|416118004
without exact diagnosis|439401001
)
should
be
started|385652002
immediately,|49499008
even
before the results|394617004
of the lumbar puncture|277762005|265232001
and
CSF analysis|272389005
are
known.|36692007

The choice
of initial treatment|884001|276239002|884001|416118004|232714002|276239002|232714002|416118004
depends
largely
on the kind|261664005
of bacteria|409822003
that cause meningitis|134198009|7180009
in a particular place|257557008|421066005
and
population.|385436007|389109008

For instance,
in the United Kingdom empirical treatment|223860005|276239002|223860005|416118004
consists
of a third-generation cefalosporin|372859005
such as cefotaxime|372704003
or
ceftriaxone.|372670001

In the USA,|223688001
where resistance|30714006
to cefalosporins|373262009
is
increasingly
found|404684003
in streptococci,|58800005
addition|260364009
of vancomycin|372735009
to the initial treatment|884001|276239002|884001|416118004|232714002|276239002|232714002|416118004
is
recommended.

Chloramphenicol,|372777009
either
alone|105529008
or
in combination|89780004
with ampicillin,|387170002
however,
appears
to
work|261041009
equally well.[47]|20572008

Empirical therapy|371018001
may
be
chosen
on the basis|418836005
of the person's age,|125676002|424144002
whether
the infection
was
preceded|236874000
by a head injury,|82271004
whether
the person|125676002
has
undergone recent neurosurgery|6493001|394610002|6493001|16545005
and
whether
or
not
a cerebral shunt|442119001|257351008|125319009
is
present.|52101004|246105001

In young children|84422007|410601007|84422007|160499008
and
those over 50 years|21481007|258707000
of age,|424144002
as well as
those who
are
immunocompromised|370391006
,
the addition|260364009
of ampicillin|387170002
is
recommended to
cover|255334000
_Listeria monocytogenes_.|36094007

Once the Gram stain results|385484003|394617004|62777006|394617004
become
available,|103328004
and
the broad type|90522003|261664005
of bacterial cause|409822003|134198009
is
known,|36692007
it
may
be
possible to|371930009|60022001
change|243326001|263703002
the antibiotics|255631004
to those likely to|2931005
deal
with the presumed group|261586004|160481000|389109008
of pathogens.|264418008

The results|394617004
of the CSF culture generally|275855006
take|419652001
longer to|255511005
become
available|103328004
(24?48 hours|123027009|259029002
).

Once
they
do
,
empiric therapy|371018001
may
be
switched
to specific antibiotic therapy|69658003|281789004
targeted
to the specific causative organism|69658003|410653004
and
its sensitivities|365705006
to antibiotics.|255631004

For an antibiotic to|255631004
be
effective|255403003|254648000
in meningitis|7180009
it
must
not only
be
active|55561003
against the pathogenic bacterium|264418008|409822003
but
also
reach|282679008
the meninges|363824000
in adequate quantities|51117008|107651007|88323005|107651007
;
some antibiotics|255631004
have
inadequate penetrance|71978007|53568006
and
therefore
have
little use|277889008|419385000
in meningitis.|7180009

Most
of the antibiotics|255631004
used|394850002
in meningitis|7180009
have
not
been
tested|272393004
directly
on people|125676002
with meningitis|7180009
in clinical trials.|110465008

Rather,
the relevant knowledge|225795001
has
mostly
derived
from laboratory|261904005
studies|110465008|224699009
in rabbits.|88818001

Tuberculous meningitis|58437007
requires
prolonged treatment|255224006|276239002|255224006|416118004
with antibiotics.|255631004

While
tuberculosis|371569005
of the lungs|39607008
is
typically
treated|28995006
for six months,|422218008|258706009
those
with tuberculous meningitis|58437007
are
typically
treated|28995006
for a year|258707000|259039008
or
longer.[14]|255511005

Adjuvant treatment|427067006|276239002|427067006|416118004
with corticosteroids|79440004
(usually dexamethasone|372584003
has
shown
some benefits,
such as a reduction|58294000|260400001|289928003
of hearing loss,|343087000|15188001
[48]
and
better short term neurological outcomes[49]|3442003|1199008|394617004
in adolescents|133937008
and
adults|133936004
from high income countries|75540009|223369002|371879000|223369002
with low rates|62482003|371880002
of HIV.|19030005|86406008|402916007

Some research
has
found|404684003
reduced rates|260400001
of death[50]|419620001|268923008
while
other research|74964007
has
not.

They also
appear
to
be
beneficial
in those with tuberculosis meningitis,|20401003|58437007|421463005|58437007
at least
in those
who
are
HIV negative.[51]|165815009

Professional guidelines therefore
recommend
the commencement
of dexamethasone|372584003
or
a similar corticosteroid just|79440004
before the first dose|255216001|277406006|255216001|408102007|232714002|277406006|232714002|408102007
of antibiotics|255631004
is
given,|419582001
and
continued|255238004
for four days.|421534005|258703001

Given|419582001
that
most
of the benefit
of the treatment|276239002|416118004
is
confined
to those with pneumococcal meningitis,|20401003|51169003|421463005|51169003
some guidelines
suggest
that dexamethasone|372584003
be
discontinued|410546004
if
another cause|134198009
for meningitis|7180009
is
identified.|7882003

The likely mechanism|2931005|257544000
is
suppression|80633008|258761002
of overactive inflammation.[52]|263829006|257552002

Adjuvant corticosteroids|427067006|79440004
have
a different role|263735002
in children|410601007|160499008
than
in adults.|133936004

Though
the benefit
of corticosteroids|79440004
has
been
demonstrated
in adults|133936004
as well as
in children|410601007|160499008
from high-income countries,|75540009|223369002|371879000|223369002
their use|277889008|419385000
in children|410601007|160499008
from low-income countries|223369002|424860001|223369002
is
not
supported|9096001|243114000
by the evidence|18669006
;
the reason|410666004
for this discrepancy|110287002
is
not
clear.|263707001

Even
in high-income countries,|75540009|223369002|371879000|223369002
the benefit
of corticosteroids|79440004
is
only
seen
when
they
are
given|419582001
prior to the first dose|255216001|277406006|255216001|408102007|232714002|277406006|232714002|408102007
of antibiotics,|255631004
and
is
greatest|4757001
in cases|398241000|413769002
of _H.|89177007|258322007|286551008

influenzae_ meningitis,|6142004|7180009
[3][53]|260313008
the incidence
of which
has
decreased|1250004|260400001|260371004
dramatically
since
the introduction|107733003
of the Hib vaccine.|412374001

Thus,
corticosteroids|79440004
are
recommended
in the treatment|276239002|416118004
of pediatric meningitis|394537008|7180009
if
the cause|134198009
is
_H.|89177007|258322007|286551008

influenzae_,|6142004
and
only
if
given|419582001
prior to the first dose|255216001|277406006|255216001|408102007|232714002|277406006|232714002|408102007
of antibiotics|255631004
;
other uses|74964007|277889008|74964007|419385000
are
controversial.[3]

Viral meningitis typically only|58170007
requires
supportive therapy|243114000
;
most viruses|49872002
responsible|394851003
for causing meningitis|23981006|7180009
are
not amenable
to specific treatment.|69658003|276239002|69658003|416118004

Viral meningitis|58170007
tends
to
run|418060005|282476009
a more benign course|242762006|30807003|288524001
than bacterial meningitis.|95883001

Herpes simplex virus|314797000
and
varicella zoster virus|19551004
may
respond
to treatment|276239002|416118004
with antiviral drugs|372701006
such as aciclovir,|425884003
but
there
are
no clinical trials|110465008
that
have
specifically
addressed|397635003
whether
this treatment|276239002|416118004
is
effective.|255403003|254648000

Mild cases|255604002|398241000|255604002|413769002
of viral meningitis|58170007
can
be
treated|28995006
at home|261770009
with conservative measures|246445000|367346004
such as fluid,|32457005|33463005|255765007
bedrest,|225316001|17535004
and
analgesics.[54]|373265006

Fungal meningitis,|24321005
such as cryptococcal meningitis,|14232007
is
treated|28995006
with long courses|255511005|288524001
of high dose antifungals,|261829003|373219008
such as amphotericin B|77703004
and
flucytosine.|387155003

Raised intracranial pressure|271719001
is
common|72906007
in fungal meningitis,|24321005
and
frequent|70232002
(ideally daily|69620002
)
lumbar punctures to|277762005
relieve|397855004
the pressure|279046003|13543005|257893003
are
recommended
,
[33]|264667004
or
alternatively
a lumbar drain.[31]|182343007|32712000|264664006

Untreated|25265005
,
bacterial meningitis|95883001
is
almost always fatal.|399166001

Viral meningitis,|58170007
in contrast,
tends
to
resolve
spontaneously
and
is
rarely fatal.|103356009|399166001

With treatment,|276239002|416118004
mortality (risk|409651001|30207005
of death|419620001|268923008
)
from bacterial meningitis|95883001
depends
on the age|424144002
of the person|125676002
and
the underlying cause.|134198009

Of newborns,|133933007
20?30%
may
die|419620001|399069006|419099009
from an episode|272128006
of bacterial meningitis.|95883001

This risk|30207005
is
much lower|242762006|261122009|4757001|261122009
in older children,|31114009
whose mortality|409651001
is
about 2%,
but
rises
again to about 19?37%
in adults.|133936004

Risk|30207005
of death|419620001|268923008
is
predicted
by various factors|256220008
apart from age,|424144002
such as the pathogen|264418008
and
the time|410669006
it
takes|419652001
for the pathogen to|264418008
be
cleared|84989007
from the cerebrospinal fluid,|65216001
[1]|260305007
the severity|272141005
of the generalized illness,|60132005|39104002

of consciousness|106167005
or
an abnormally low count|371880002|258734002
of white blood cells|767002|52501007
in the CSF.

Meningitis|7180009
caused|23981006|134198009
by _H.|89177007|258322007|286551008

influenzae_|6142004
and
meningococci|17872004
has
a better prognosis|3442003|20481000
than cases|398241000|413769002
caused|23981006|134198009
by group B streptococci,|43492007
coliforms and _S.|77309002

pneumonia_.|205237003

In adults,|133936004
too,
meningococcal meningitis|192644005
has
a lower mortality|261122009|409651001
(3?7%|260313008
)
than pneumococcal disease.[4]|9861002|64572001|70447008|64572001

In children there|410601007|160499008
are
several potential disabilities|261028005|30207005|21134002
which
may
result|394617004
from damage|37782003
to the nervous system,|25087005|278196006
including|55919000
sensorineural hearing loss,|60700002
epilepsy,|313307000
learning|69998004
and
behavioral difficulties,|844005|371157007
as well as
decreased intelligence.|1250004|22851009|260400001|22851009|260371004|22851009

These
occur|272120004
in about 15%
of survivors.

Some
of the hearing loss|343087000|15188001
may
be
reversible.|35174006

In adults,|133936004
66%
of all cases|398241000|413769002
emerge
without disability.|21134002

The main problems|63161005|55607006
are
deafness|343087000|8531006
(
in 14%
)
and
cognitive impairment|386806002
(
in 10%
).[4]|260308009

Although
meningitis|7180009
is
a notifiable disease|64572001
in many countries,|223369002
the exact incidence rate
is
unknown.|261665006

Bacterial meningitis|95883001
occurs|272120004
in about 3 people|125676002
per 100,000 annually|53281000
in Western countries.|223369002

Population-wide studies|385436007|90522003|110465008|385436007|90522003|224699009|389109008|90522003|110465008|389109008|90522003|224699009
have
shown
that viral meningitis|58170007
is
more common,|242762006|72906007
at 10.9
per 100,000,
and
occurs|272120004
more often|242762006|70232002
in the summer.

In Brazil,|223715002
the rate
of bacterial meningitis|95883001
is
higher,|75540009|371879000
at 45.8
per 100,000 annually.|53281000

Sub-Saharan Africa|409988000
has
been
plagued|58750007
by large epidemics|255509001
of meningococcal meningitis|192644005
for over|21481007
a century,
[58]
leading|236874000
to it
being
labeled
the "meningitis belt".|7180009|74094004

Epidemics typically
occur|272120004
in the dry season|13880007|21864008
(December
to June
)
,
and
an epidemic wave
can
last
two|420797005
to three years,|421291004|258707000
dying|399069006
out
during the intervening rainy seasons.|21864008

Attack rates|217315002|216299002
of 100?800 cases|398241000|413769002
per 100,000
are
encountered
in this area,|42798000
[60]
which
is
poorly|556001
served
by medical care.|74188005

These cases|398241000|413769002
are
predominantly
caused|23981006|134198009
by meningococci.|17872004

The largest epidemic ever|255509001|263768009
recorded
in history swept|392521001
across the entire region|255503000|410673009|260232004|410673009
in 1996?1997,
causing|23981006
over 250,000 cases|398241000|413769002
and
25,000 deaths.[61]|419620001|268923008

Meningococcal disease|23511006
occurs|272120004
in epidemics
in areas|42798000
where many people|260396001|125676002
live|419749002
together
for the first time,|255216001|410669006|232714002|410669006
such as army barracks
during mobilization,|183376001
college campuses[1]|224864007
and
the annual Hajj pilgrimage.|53281000

Although
the pattern|272135003
of epidemic cycles|44180009
in Africa|223498002
is
not well understood, several factors|20572008|66216009
have
been
associated|47429007
with the development|278923009
of epidemics
in the meningitis belt.|7180009|74094004

They
include|55919000
:
medical conditions|74188005|260905004
(immunological susceptibility|37523008|76522002|37523008|118588007
of the population|385436007|389109008
)
,
demographic conditions|260905004
(travel|420008001
and
large population displacements|255509001|385436007|263739008|255509001|389109008|263739008
)
,
socioeconomic conditions|260905004
(overcrowding
and
poor living conditions|11403006|4683004|255351007|4683004
)
,
climatic conditions|260905004
(drought
and
dust storms|33008008
)
,
and
concurrent infections|68405009
(acute respiratory infections|195647007
).[60]

There
are
significant differences|386134007|263735002
in the local distribution|255470001|255464007
of causes|134198009
for bacterial meningitis.|95883001

For instance,
while

most disease episodes|64572001|272128006
in Europe,|223502009
group A|272414007
is
found|404684003
in Asia|223500001
and
continues|255238004
to
predominate|83296008
in Africa,|223498002
where
it
causes|134198009
most
of the major epidemics|255603008
in the meningitis belt,|7180009|74094004
accounting
for about 80%
to 85%
of documented meningococcal meningitis cases.[60]|397934002|192644005|398241000|397934002|192644005|413769002

Some
suggest
that Hippocrates
may
have
realized
the existence
of meningitis,|7180009
[6]
and
it
seems
that meningism|437986008
was

to
pre-|236874000|272113006
Renaissance physicians|309343006
such as Avicenna.

The description
of tuberculous meningitis,|58437007
then
called "dropsy|423666004
in the brain",|12738006|258335003
is
often|70232002
attributed|246061005
to Edinburgh physician Sir Robert Whytt|309343006
in a posthumous
report|229059009|223458004
that
appeared
in 1768,
although
the link
with tuberculosis|371569005
and
its pathogen|264418008
was
not
made
until the next century.[62][63]|18769003|255260001

It
appears
that epidemic meningitis|192644005
is
a relatively recent phenomenon.|6493001

The first|255216001|232714002
recorded major outbreak|255603008|443684005
occurred|272120004
in Geneva
in 1805.

Several other epidemics|261028005
in Europe|223502009
and
the United States|223688001
were
described
shortly afterward,
and
the first report|255216001|229059009|255216001|223458004|232714002|229059009|232714002|223458004
of an epidemic
in Africa|223498002
appeared
in 1840.

African epidemics|413464008
became
much more common|242762006|72906007|4757001|72906007
in the 20th century,
starting|255395001|385652002
with a major epidemic sweeping Nigeria|255603008|223565009
and
Ghana|223557006
in 1905?1908.[64]

The first report|255216001|229059009|255216001|223458004|232714002|229059009|232714002|223458004
of bacterial infection underlying meningitis|95883001|301811001|7180009
was
by the Austrian bacteriologist Anton Weichselbaum,|68486007|18537005
who
in 1887
described
the _meningococcus_.|17872004

Mortality|409651001
from meningitis|7180009
was
very high|260360000
(over 90%|21481007|264705001|21481007|264703008
)
in early reports.|264499004|229059009|264499004|223458004

In 1906,
antiserum|398655004
was
produced
in horses|35354009
;
this
was
developed
further|46053002
by the American scientist Simon Flexner|308027003|262144001
and
markedly decreased mortality|46998006|1250004|409651001|46998006|260400001|409651001|46998006|260371004|409651001
from meningococcal disease.|23511006

In 1944,
penicillin|373270004
was
first|255216001|232714002
reported to|229059009|223458004
be
effective|255403003|254648000
in meningitis.|7180009

The introduction|107733003
in the late 20th century|260383002
of _Haemophilus_ vaccines|71268004|398827000
led|88488004|236874000
to a marked fall|46998006|1912002
in cases|398241000|413769002
of meningitis|7180009
associated|47429007
with this pathogen,|264418008
[38]|264670000
and
in 2002,
evidence|18669006
emerged
that treatment|276239002|416118004
with steroids|116566001
could
improve|385425000|3442003|385633008
the prognosis|20481000
of bacterial meningitis.[52][49][68]|95883001|264697007
