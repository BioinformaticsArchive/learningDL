*Oligodendrogliomas|73348003
*
*
are
a type|261664005
of glioma|393564001|416500007
that
are
believed
to
originate
from the oligodendrocytes|66254009
of the brain|12738006|258335003
or
from a glial precursor cell.|2156000

They
occur|272120004
primarily
in adults|133936004
(9.4%
of all primary brain|63161005|12738006|63161005|258335003|261424001|12738006|261424001|258335003
and
central nervous system tumors|126951006
)
but
are
also
found|404684003
in children|410601007|160499008
(4%|260308009
of all primary brain tumors|63161005|126952004|261424001|126952004
).

The average age|424144002
at diagnosis|439401001
is
35 years.[1]|258707000

The etiology|134198009
of oligodendrogliomas|73348003
is
unknown.|261665006

Some
studies|110465008|224699009
have
linked oligodendroglioma|73348003
with a viral cause.|134198009

A 2009 Oxford Neurosymposium study|110465008|224699009
illustrated
a 69% correlation|264698002
between NJDS gene mutation|67271001|55446002
and
the tumor initiation|108369006|312009002
shown
by Kevin Smith.|308323009

A single case report|125681006|398241000|229059009|125681006|398241000|223458004|50607009|398241000|229059009|50607009|398241000|223458004

linked oligodendroglioma|73348003
to irradiation|359549004|108290001

In anywhere
from fifty
to eighty percent|118582008
of cases,|398241000|413769002
the first symptom|255216001|232714002
of an oligodendroglioma|73348003
is
the onset|77374008
of seizure activity.|91175000|48761009|91175000|55561003|91175000|258745004|91175000|257733005

They
occur|272120004
mainly
in the frontal lobe thus|83251001|180920004
affecting|247591002|248448006
personality.|71565002

Headaches|25064002
combined|89780004
with increased intracranial pressure|271719001
are
also
a common symptom|72906007
of oligodendroglioma.|73348003

Depending
on the location|246267002
of the tumor,|108369006
any neurological deficit|264552009
can
be
induced|16404004
,
from visual loss,|397540003
motor weakness|13791008|260407003
and
cognitive decline.|386806002

A Computed Tomography (CT)|77477000
or
Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scan|113091000
is
necessary to
characterize
the anatomy|91723000
of this tumor (size,|263605001
location,|246267002
heter/homogeneity
).

However,
final diagnosis|89100005
of this tumor,|108369006
like most tumors,|108369006
relies
on histopathologic examination|394597005
(biopsy examination|86273004|5880005
).

Oligodendrogliomas|73348003
cannot
currently|15240007
be
differentiated|263933003
from other brain lesions solely|74964007|301766008
by their clinical|58147004
or
radiographic appearance.|258106000|386548000|258106000|255412001

As
such,
a brain biopsy|12738006|86273004|258335003|86273004
is
the only method|50607009|260686004|50607009|272394005|420295001|260686004|420295001|272394005
of definitive diagnosis.|261002007|439401001|261002007

Oligodendrogliomas|73348003
recapitulate
the appearance|386548000|255412001
of the normal resident oligodendroglia|17621005|405277009|66254009|258744000|405277009|66254009
of the brain.|12738006|258335003

(
Their name
derives
from the Greek roots 'oligo' meaning ?|1451003|2338009|23243007
few?
and
'dendro' meaning ?trees?.|22097005
)
They
are
generally
composed
of cells|4421005
with small to slightly|255507004|425404009
enlarged|260376009|118452000
round nuclei|42700002|84640000
with dark,|255419005
compact nuclei|84640000
and
a small amount|255507004|107651007
of eosinophilic cytoplasm.|14793004|365601007|191357009|419455006|419769007

They
are
often|70232002
referred to|439980006
as
"
fried|227282006
egg" cells|263828003
due to their histologic appearance.|67151002|386548000|67151002|255412001

They
appear
as a monotonous population|385436007|389109008
of mildly|255604002
enlarged|260376009|118452000
round cells|42700002|4421005
infiltrating|47351003
normal brain parenchyma|17621005|12738006|17621005|258335003|258744000|12738006|258744000|258335003
and
producing vague nodules.|25615006|27925004|25615006|279365004

Although
the tumor|108369006
may
appear
to
be
vaguely
circumscribed|355648006
,
it
is
by definition
a diffusely infiltrating tumor.|47351003|108369006

Classically
they
tend
to
have
a vasculature
of finely branching capillaries|77796000|20982000
that
may
take|419652001
on a ?chicken wire? appearance .|409910000|63112008|386548000|409910000|63112008|255412001|226955001|63112008|386548000|226955001|63112008|255412001

When
invading
grey matter
structures
such as cortex,|40146001
the neoplastic oligodendrocytes|108369006|66254009
tend
to
cluster
around neurons|47220008
exhibiting
a phenomenon
referred|439980006
to
as ?perineuronal satellitosis?.|52214007

Oligodendrogliomas|73348003
may
invade
preferentially
around vessels|59820001
or
under the pial surface|410678000
of the brain.|12738006|258335003

Oligodendrogliomas|73348003
must
be
differentiated|263933003
from the more common astrocytoma.|242762006|72906007|254938000

Non-classical variants|255333006|40885006|260997001|40885006
and
combined tumors|89780004|108369006
of
both
oligodendroglioma|73348003
and
astrocytoma differentiation|254938000
are
seen
,
making
this distinction
controversial
between different neuropathology groups.|263735002|394599008|261586004|263735002|394599008|160481000

In the
US,
in general, neuropathologists|60132005|11661002
trained|118629009|62193008
on the West Coast
are
more liberal|242762006
in the diagnosis|439401001
of oligodendroliomas
than
either
East Coast
or
Midwest trained neuropathologists|118629009|11661002|62193008|11661002
who
render
the diagnosis|439401001
of oligodendroglioma|73348003
for only classic variants.|50607009|255301002|40885006|50607009|255333006|40885006|420295001|255301002|40885006|420295001|255333006|40885006

Molecular diagnostics|290005005|439401001|290005005|261004008
may
make
this differentiation
obsolete|41228009
in the future.

Other glial|74964007|2156000
and
glioneuronal tumors|108369006
with which
they
are
often|70232002
confused|286933003
due to their monotonous round cell appearance|42700002|4421005|386548000|42700002|4421005|255412001|42700002|362837007|386548000|42700002|362837007|255412001
include|55919000
pilocytic astrocytoma,|128854008
central neurocytoma,|128858006
the so-called dysembryoplastic neuroepithelial tumor,|223528007|128788005
or
occasionally ependymoma.|443643007

The histopathologic grading|394597005|258349007|394597005|371469007
of oligodendrogliomas|73348003
is
controversial.

Currently|15240007
the most commonly|4757001
used|394850002
grading schema|258349007|371469007
is
based|418836005
on year 2007 World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines.|258707000|263775005|21139007|259039008|263775005|21139007

Oligodendrogliomas|73348003
are
generally
dichotomized
into grade II|1663004
(low grade
)
and
grade III|263843001
(high grade|24484000
)
tumors.|108369006

The designation|118522005
of grade III oligodendroglioma|263843001|73348003|73348003
(high grade|24484000
)
generally
subsumes
the previous diagnoses|48318009
of anaplastic|263918006
or
malignant oligodendroglioma.|3102004

Unfortunately,
the
WHO guidelines
include|55919000
subjective criteria|255362007
in differentiating grade II|263933003|1663004
and
grade III tumors|263843001|108369006|108369006
including|55919000
the appreciation
of ?significant? hypercellularity|386134007|76197007
and
pleomorphism|4916000
in the higher grade lesion.|24484000

In addition,|260364009
the presence|386397008
of low mitotic activity,|62482003|48761009|62482003|55561003|62482003|258745004|62482003|257733005|371880002|48761009|371880002|55561003|371880002|258745004|371880002|257733005
vascular proliferation
and
necrosis,|6574001
including|55919000
pseudopallisading necrosis|6574001
are
insufficient|71978007|423437008
by themselves to
elevate|75540009
the grade|258349007|371469007
of these tumors.|108369006

This
leads|88488004|236874000
to inevitable interobserver variability|255372005
in diagnosis|439401001
by pathologists.|61207006

The ultimate responsibility
for making treatment decisions|247583006|276239002|247583006|416118004
and
interpretation|280452008
of these diagnoses|439401001
lies|40199007|255576009
with the oncologist
in consultation|11429006
with the patient|116154003
and
their family.|35359004

It
has
been
proposed
that
WHO guidelines
should
contain|42504009
a category
for grade IV oligodendrogliomas|258349007|73348003|371469007|73348003
which essentially
appear
to
be
glial neoplasms|393564001
with overwhelming features
of glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) arising|393563007|68727004
from known lower grade oligodendrogliomas|36692007|73348003
or
GBM|393563007
with a significant proportion|386134007|8212001
of oligodendroglial differentiation.|66254009

The diagnostic utility|439401001|225927009|261004008|225927009
of this latter category
is
uncertain|64957009
as these tumors|108369006
may
behave
either
like glioblastoma|63634009
or
grade III oligodendrogliomas.|263843001|73348003|73348003

As
such,
this
is
an exceptionally unusual diagnosis.|439401001

The updated
WHO guidelines
published
in 2007 recommends
classifying|73504009
such tumors|108369006
for the time|410669006
being
as ?glioblastoma|63634009
with oligodendroglioma component?.|73348003|246093002

It
remains
to
be
established|263748003|385645004
whether
or
not
these tumors|108369006
carry|288345009
a better prognosis|3442003|20481000
than standard glioblastomas.|63634009

By far,|46053002
the most common structural deformity|4757001|72906007|276654001|4757001|72906007|127560004|4757001|72906007|417893002
found|404684003
is
co-deletion
of chromosomal arms 1p|263550009
and
19q.

The high frequency|27732004
of co-deletion
is
a striking feature
of this glial tumour|393564001
and
is
considered
as a "genetic signature"|3950001|255395001
of oligodendroglioma.|73348003

Allelic losses
on 1p
and
19q,
either
separately
or
combined,|89780004
are
more common|242762006|72906007
in classic oligodendrogliomas|255301002|73348003|255333006|73348003
than
in
either
astrocytomas|254938000
or
oligoastrocytomas.|253072003

In one study,|421379005|110465008|421379005|224699009
classic oligodendrogliomas|255301002|73348003|255333006|73348003
showed
1p loss
in 35
of 42
(83%
)
cases,|398241000|413769002
19q loss
in 28
of 39
(72%
)
,
and
these
were
combined|89780004
in 27
of 39
(69%|264698002
)
cases|398241000|413769002
;
there
was
no significant difference|386134007|263735002
in 1p/19q loss
of heterozygosity status|14556007|263490005
between low-grade
and
anaplastic oligodendrogliomas.|3102004

1p/19q co-deletion
has
been
correlated
with
both
chemosensitivity
and
improved prognosis|385425000|20481000|3442003|20481000
in oligodendrogliomas.|73348003

The gene products|88878007
lost
as a consequence|103332005
of this codeletion
may
include|55919000
mediators
of resistance|30714006
to genotoxic therapies.|276239002

Alternatively,
1p/19q loss
might
be
an early oncogenic lesion|264499004|88376000
promoting
the formation|11798007|255277001
of glial neoplasms,|393564001
which
retain|397909002
high sensitivity|75540009|35209006|75540009|365705006|371879000|35209006|371879000|365705006
to genotoxic stress.|262188008

Most larger cancer treatment centers routinely|255509001|363346000|276239002|26216008|255509001|363346000|416118004|26216008|255509001|372087000|276239002|26216008|255509001|372087000|416118004|26216008|263768009|363346000|276239002|26216008|263768009|363346000|416118004|26216008|263768009|372087000|276239002|26216008|263768009|372087000|416118004|26216008
check|360160009
for the deletion
of 1p/19q
as part|260726005
of the pathology report|371528001
for oligodendrogliomas.|73348003

The status|263490005
of the 1p/19q loci
can
be
detected|260373001
by FISH,|90580008
loss of heterozygosity (LOH) analysis|14556007|272389005
or
virtual karyotyping.|312948004

Virtual karyotyping|312948004
has
the advantage
of assessing
the entire genome|255503000|18470003|260232004|18470003
in one assay,|421379005|58779000|421379005|272392009
as well as
the 1p/19q loci.

This
allows
assessment|386053000
of other key loci|74964007
in glial tumors,|393564001
such as EGFR
and
TP53 copy number status.|410680006|263490005|410681005|263490005

Whereas
the prognostic relevance
of 1p
and
19q deletions
is
well established|20572008|263748003|20572008|385645004
for anaplastic oligodendrogliomas|3102004
and
mixed oligoastrocytomas,|253071005
the prognostic relevance
of the deletions
for low-grade gliomas|428954009
is
more controversial.|242762006

In terms
of low-grade gliomas,|428954009
a recent study also|6493001|110465008|6493001|224699009
suggests
that 1p/19q co-deletion
may
be
associated|47429007
with a (1
;19
)
(q10
;p10
)
translocation|15897004
which,
like the combined 1p/19q deletion,|89780004
is
associated|47429007
with superior overall survival|261183002
and
progression-free survival|246453008|37837009|246450006|37837009
in low-grade glioma patients.|428954009|116154003

Oligodendrogliomas|73348003
show
only rarely mutations|50607009|103356009|55446002|420295001|103356009|55446002
in the p53 gene,|67271001
which
is
in contrast
to other gliomas.|74964007|393564001

Epidermal growth factor receptor amplification|86960007
and
whole 1p/19q codeletion|260232004
are
mutually exclusive
and
predictive
of completely different outcomes,|263735002|394617004
with EGFR amplification
predicting
poor prognosis.|170969009

There
is
a strong correlation|260404005
between 1p/19q codeletion
and
the expression|10012005
of proneural genes,|67271001
suggesting
that gliomas|393564001
with a 1p19q codeletion
represent
a subgroup
of proneural gliomas.[9]|393564001

Oligodendrogliomas|73348003
are
generally
felt|285854004
to
be
incurable
using|260676000
current treatments.|15240007|276239002

However
compared
to the more common astrocytomas,|242762006|72906007|254938000
they
are
slowly|419443000
growing
with prolonged survival.|255224006

In one series,|421379005|13039001
median survival times|399488007|445320007|260528009|445320007
for oligodendrogliomas|73348003
were
11.6 years|258707000
for grade II|1663004
and
3.5 years|260280001|258707000
for grade III.[10]|263843001

However,
such figures
can
be
misleading
since
they
do
not factor
in the types|261664005
of treatment|276239002|416118004
nor
the genetic signature|3950001|255395001
of the tumors.|108369006

A recent study analyzed survival|6493001|110465008|6493001|224699009
based|418836005
on chromosomal deletions
and
the effects|253861007
of radiation|30821001|82107009|108290001
or
chemotherapy|416608005|367336001
as treatment,|276239002|416118004
with the following results|255260001|394617004
(
both
low-grade
and
anaplastic oligodendrogliomas|3102004
)
:
1p/19q deletion
with radiation|30821001|82107009|108290001
= 121 months|258706009
(mean|255586005

and
no 1p/19q deletion
with chemotherapy|416608005|367336001
= 75 months|258706009
(mean|255586005

Another study divided anaplastic oligodendrogliomas|110465008|422033008|3102004|224699009|422033008|3102004
into the following four clinically relevant groups|255260001|421534005|261586004|255260001|421534005|160481000
of histology|67151002
with the following results|255260001|394617004
:
combined 1p/19q loss|89780004
= median survival|399488007|260528009
was
>123 months|258706009
(
not yet
reached|282679008

,
1p loss only
= median survival|399488007|260528009

1p
intact|11163003
with TP53 mutation|55446002

and
1p

with no TP53 mutation|55446002
= median survival|399488007|260528009
was
16 months.[12]|258706009

Because of the indolent nature|277302009
of these tumors|108369006
and
the potential morbidity|30207005
associated|47429007
with neurosurgery,|394610002|16545005
chemotherapy|416608005|367336001
and
radiation therapy,|108290001
most neurooncologists
will
initially|884001
pursue
a course|288524001
of watchful waiting|103705002
and
treat|395077000
patients symptomatically.|116154003

Symptomatic treatment often|264931009|276239002|70232002|264931009|416118004|70232002
includes|55919000
the use|277889008|419385000
of anticonvulsants|255632006
for seizures|91175000
and
steroids|116566001
for brain swelling.|2032001

PCV chemotherapy|416608005|367336001
(Procarbazine,|387474003
CCNU
and
Vincristine|387126006
has
been
shown
to
be
effective|255403003|254648000
and
was
the most commonly used chemotherapy regimen|4757001|394850002|367336001
used|394850002
for treating anaplastic oligodendrogliomas,|28995006|3102004
[13]
but
is
now
being
superseded
by a newer drug|7147002|410942007
:
Temozolomide.|387009002

Temozolomide|387009002
is
a common chemotherapeutic drug|72906007|416608005|410942007|72906007|367336001|410942007
to which oligodendrogliomas|73348003
appear
to
be
quite sensitive.|83185005

It
is
often|70232002
used|394850002
as a first line therapy,|255216001|50009006|276239002|232714002|50009006|276239002
especially
because of its relatively mild side effects|255604002
when
compared
to other chemotherapeutic drugs.[14]|74964007|416608005|410942007|74964007|367336001|410942007

Nevertheless,
a retrospective study|110465008|224699009
on 1054 patients|116154003
with anaplastic oligodendroglioma,|3102004
presented|246105001
during the 2009 ASCO Annual Meeting,|53281000|229057006
suggests
that PCV therapy|276239002
may
be
superior|261183002
in efficacy
to the newer temozolomide therapy.|7147002|387009002|276239002

Median time|399488007|410669006|260528009|410669006
to progression|246453008|246450006
for patients|116154003
with 1p19q co-deletion
was
longer|255511005
following|255260001
PCV
alone|105529008
(7.6 years|258707000
)
than
with temozolomide|387009002
alone|105529008
(3.3 years|260313008|258707000
)
;
median overall survival|399488007|260528009
was
also longer|255511005
with PCV treatment|276239002|416118004
versus
temozolomide treatment|387009002|276239002|387009002|416118004
(
not
reached|282679008
,
vs.

7.1 years|258707000
).[15]

The standard dosing schedule|277406006|408102007
of temozolomide|387009002
is
5 consecutive days|264706000|258703001|264605009|258703001
of daily dosing|69620002
during 28 day cycles.|258703001|44180009|259032004|44180009

However,
different dosing schedules|263735002|277406006|263735002|408102007
may
produce
better results,|3442003|394617004
such as continuous daily dosing|255238004|69620002
using|260676000
lower amounts|261122009|107651007
of drug|410942007
(e.g.|258795003

21 day dosing|258703001|259032004
during 28 day cycles|258703001|44180009|259032004|44180009
).

As an example
of an altered dosing schedule,|277406006|408102007
promising
results|394617004
have
been
shown
using|260676000
lower|261122009
daily doses|69620002|277406006
on each day|258703001|259032004
for 7 weeks,|258705008
followed|367409002
by a 4 week|260308009|258705008|260308009|259038000
off periods.|259037005

Regarding
the duration|103335007
of dosing,
for oligodendrogliomas|73348003
the duration|103335007
prescribed
by oncologists
varies
considerably
and
seems
to range
from 6 cycles to over 32 cycles|44180009|21481007
(i.e.|42146005|22971001

over 3 years|260313008|258707000
).

In one study,|421379005|110465008|421379005|224699009
researchers
compared
patients|116154003
who
received
temozolomide|387009002
for
at least 12 months|276139006|258706009|263796003|258706009
on the 5/28 day cycle,|264706000|258703001|44180009|264706000|259032004|44180009|264605009|258703001|44180009|264605009|259032004|44180009
dividing|422033008
such patients|116154003
into two groups|420797005|261586004|420797005|160481000
:
"short term" patients|116154003
receiving
temozolomide|387009002
for 12-18 cycles|44180009
and
those "long term" patients|116154003
receiving
19
or
more
cycles
(range
was
19
to 32 cycles|44180009
).

Researches
found|404684003
that there
was
a statistically significant advantage|386134007
for "long term" treatment|276239002|416118004
(median progression free survival|399488007|246453008|37837009|399488007|246450006|37837009|260528009|246453008|37837009|260528009|246450006|37837009
for "short term" patients|116154003
was
95 weeks|258705008
(follow up|308273005
of 73 weeks|258705008
)
,
but
for "long term" patiets
the median progression free survival|399488007|246453008|37837009|399488007|246450006|37837009|260528009|246453008|37837009|260528009|246450006|37837009
was
not yet
reached|282679008
(follow up|308273005
of 134 weeks|258705008

).[17][18]

Because of their diffusely
infiltrating|47351003
nature,|277302009
oligodendrogliomas|73348003
cannot
be
completely
resected|118292001
and
are
not curable
by surgical excision.|128303001

If
the tumor mass|108369006|300848003|108369006|118538004
compresses|37204000
adjacent brain structures,|18769003|12738006
a neurosurgeon|45544007
will
typically
remove|127485006
as much|242762006|4757001
of the tumor|108369006
as
he
or
she
can
without damaging other critical, healthy brain structures.|2470005|263775005

Surgery|83578000
may
be
followed|367409002
up
by chemotherapy,|416608005|367336001
radiation,|30821001|82107009|108290001
or
a mix|26242008|421826007
of both,
but
recent studies|6493001|110465008|6493001|224699009
suggest
that radiation|30821001|82107009|108290001
does
not
improve|385425000|3442003|385633008
overall survival
(even
when
age,|424144002
clinical data,|58147004
histological grading,|67151002|258349007|67151002|371469007
and
type|261664005
of surgery|83578000
are
considered
)
,
and
should
be
avoided
when
treating oligodendrogliomas.|28995006|73348003

However,
it
is
possible|371930009|60022001
that radiotherapy|419815003|108290001
may
prolong|255224006
the overall time|410669006
to progression.[11][15]|246453008|246450006

Oligodendrogliomas,|73348003
like all other infiltrating gliomas,|74964007|47351003|393564001
have
a very high|260360000
(
almost uniform|27617004
)
rate
of recurrence|246455001
and
gradually
increase|260366006
in grade|258349007|371469007
over time.|410669006

Recurrent tumors|25173007
are
generally
treated|28995006
with more aggressive chemotherapy|242762006|61372001|416608005|242762006|61372001|367336001|242762006|416608005|242762006|367336001
and
radiation therapy.|108290001

Recently,|6493001
stereotactic surgery|313226005|83578000
has
proven successful|277025001|385669000
in treating small tumors|28995006|272418005
that
have
been
diagnosed|439401001
early.|264499004

Long-term survival
is
reported|229059009|223458004
in a minority|410599005|255606000
of patients.|116154003

With aggressive treatment|61372001|276239002|61372001|416118004|276239002|416118004
and
close monitoring,|29179001|302805002
it
is
possible to|371930009|60022001
outlive
the typical life expectancies|224130005|410517006
for
both
low grade
and
high grade oligodendrogliomas.|24484000|73348003

Westergaard?s study|110465008|224699009
(1997
)
showed
that patients|116154003
younger|84422007
than 20 years|258707000
had
a median survival|399488007|260528009
of 17.5 years.|258707000

Another study|110465008|224699009
shows
a 34% survival rate
after 20 years.|258707000

However,
as
discussed
above,
such figures
can
be
misleading
since
they
do
not factor
in the types|261664005
of treatment|276239002|416118004
nor
the genetic signature|3950001|255395001
of the tumors.|108369006

As well,|20572008
such historic data|392521001
loses
significance|386134007
due to the relatively long survival|255511005
of patients|116154003
(
compared
to other types|74964007|261664005
of brain tumors|126952004
)
and
the introduction|107733003
of newer treatment options|7147002|276239002|7147002|416118004
