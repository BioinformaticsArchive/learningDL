*Tetraplegia|11538006
*
*,
also
known|36692007
as
*
*quadriplegia|11538006
*
*,
is
paralysis|44695005
caused|23981006|134198009
by illness|39104002
or
injury
to a human|278412004
that results|394617004
in the partial|255609007
or
total loss|258755000|255619001
of use|277889008|419385000
of all
their limbs|66019005
and
torso|22943007
;
paraplegia|60389000
is
similar
but
does
not
affect|4065008
the arms.|40983000

The loss
is
usually sensory|262139008
and
motor,
which means|255586005
that
both
sensation|106148006|271712005|272144002
and
control|31509003
are
lost._[citation
needed|410525008|103325001
_]

It
is
caused|23981006|134198009
by damage|37782003
to the brain|12738006|258335003
or
the spinal cord|2748008|180959008
at a high level C1?C7?|75540009|258395000|75540009|276625007|371879000|258395000|371879000|276625007
in particular, spinal cord injuries|90584004
secondary|2603003|81170007
to an injury
to the cervical spine.|122494005|260488005

The injury,
which
is
known|36692007
as a lesion,
causes|134198009
victims to
lose
partial|255609007
or
total function|258755000|246464006|255619001|246464006
of all four limbs,|421534005|66019005
meaning|255586005
the arms|40983000
and
the legs.|30021000

Tetraplegia|11538006
is
defined
in many ways
;
C1?C4 usually
affects|4065008
arm movement more so|40983000|255324009|53120007|255324009|182245002|255324009|302538001|255324009
than a C5?C7 injury
;
however,
all tetraplegics
have
or
have
had
some kind|261664005
of finger dysfunction.|7569003|386585008|302541005|386585008

So,|223528007
it
is
not uncommon to|103356009
have
a tetraplegic
with fully functional arms|40143009|40983000|246464006|40983000
but
no nervous control|31509003
of their fingers|7569003|259052003
and
thumbs.|76505004

Typical causes|134198009
of this damage|37782003
are
trauma
(
such as a traffic collision,|37169002
diving|63498000
into shallow water,|11713004|119318008
a fall,|1912002
a sports injury
)
,
disease|64572001
(
such as transverse myelitis|16631009
or
polio|398102009
or
congenital disorders,|66091009
such as muscular dystrophy|73297009
or
multiple sclerosis.|24700007

It
is
possible to|371930009|60022001
suffer
a broken neck|45048000|302550007
without
becoming
tetraplegic,
such as
when
the vertebrae|420345000
are
fractured|125605004
or
dislocated|263736001
but
the spinal cord|2748008|180959008
is
not
damaged.|37782003

Conversely,
it
is
possible to|371930009|60022001
injure
the spinal cord|2748008|180959008
without breaking
the spine,|421060004|44300000|243930007
such as
when
a ruptured disc|415747007|263862003
or
bony spur|88998003
on the vertebra|420345000|181817002
protrudes|112639008
into the spinal column.|421060004|44300000

The condition|260905004
is
termed _tetraplegia_|11538006
or
_quadriplegia_.|11538006

Both
terms mean "paralysis|255586005|44695005
of four limbs"|421534005|66019005
;
tetraplegia|11538006
is
more commonly|242762006
used|394850002
in Europe|223502009
than
in the
US.

In 1991,
when
the American Spinal Cord Injury Classification system|90584004|73504009
was
revised|261560009
,
it
was
recommended
that
the term tetraplegia|11538006
be
used|394850002
to
improve|385425000|3442003|385633008
consistency|107646001
("tetra",|372809001
like "plegia",|44695005
has
a Greek root,|1451003|85077000|1451003|2338009
whereas
"quadra"
has
a Latin root|85077000|2338009
).[1]|260305007

Spinal cord injuries|90584004
are
classified|73504009
as complete|255594003
and
incomplete|255599008|255609007
by the American Spinal Injury Association (ASIA) classification.|262521009|263534001|73504009|262521009|272151006|73504009

The ASIA scale|223500001|19892000|223500001|278111002
grades|258349007
patients|116154003
based|418836005
on their functional impairment|40143009|40226000|246464006|40226000
as a result|394617004
of the injury,
grading|258349007|371469007
a patient|116154003
from A to D.

(
see|281004000
table 1|86407004
for criteria
)
This
has
considerable consequences|103332005
for surgical planning|83578000|312011006|83578000|397943006
and
therapy.[2]|276239002

Table 1|86407004
:
ASIA impairment scale[2]|223500001|40226000|19892000|223500001|40226000|278111002

Pathophysiologically,
the spinal cord|2748008|180959008
of the tetraplegic patient|116154003
can
be
divided|422033008
into three segments|421291004|264193005
which
can
be
useful
for classifying|73504009
the injury.

First there|255216001|232714002
is
an injured functional medullary segment.|40143009|38254008|264193005|40143009|26519002|264193005|246464006|38254008|264193005|246464006|26519002|264193005

This segment|264193005
has
unparalysed
,
functional muscles|40143009|91727004|246464006|91727004
;
the action|129264002
of these muscles|91727004
is
voluntary,|255375007
not permanent|6934004
and
strength|260404005
can
be
evaluated
by the British Medical Research Council (BMRC) scale.|74188005|19892000|74188005|278111002

This scale|19892000|278111002
is
used|394850002
when
upper limb surgery|53120007|83578000|182245002|83578000
is
planned,|397943006
as
referred to|439980006
in the 'International Classification|73504009
for hand surgery|112746006
in tetraplegic patients'|116154003
(
see|281004000
table 2|86407004
).[3]|260313008

A lesional segment|264193005
(
or
an injured metamere
)
consists
of denervated corresponding muscles.|91727004

The lower motor neuron (LMN)|91770004
of these muscles|91727004
is
damaged.|37782003

These muscles|91727004
are
hypotonic, atrophic|399979006|13331008
and
have
no spontaneous contraction.|5054005|78558002

The existence
of joint contractures|7890003
should
be
monitored.[3]|302805002|13288007

Below the level|258395000|276625007
of the injured metamere there
is
an injured sublesional segment|264193005
with intact lower motor neuron,|11163003|91770004
which means|255586005
that medullary reflexes|38254008|87572000|38254008|106146005|26519002|87572000|26519002|106146005
are
present,|52101004|246105001
but
the upper cortical control|261183002|68594002|31509003|261183002|40146001|31509003|261183002|50403003|31509003
is
lost.

These muscles|91727004
show
some increase|260366006
in tone|223628004|258691001
when
elongated
and
sometimes spasticity,|397790002
the trophicity|87276001|384759009
is
good.[3]|20572008

Incomplete spinal cord injuries|255599008|90584004|255609007|90584004
result|394617004
in
varied post injury presentations.|288563008|246105001

There
are
three main syndromes|421291004|63161005
described
,
depending
on the exact site|10546003
and
extent|255590007
of the lesion.

The central cord syndrome|282787000
:
most
of the cord lesion
is
in the gray matter
of the spinal cord,|2748008|180959008
sometimes
the lesion
continues|255238004
in the white matter.|413773004|185984009|371251000

The results|394617004
of tendon transfers|264983002
for patients|116154003
with complete injuries|255594003
are
predictable.

On the other hand,|74964007|85562004|74964007|302539009
it
is
well known|20572008|36692007
that muscles|91727004
lacking|41277001
normal excitation|17621005|258744000
perform|398166005
unreliably
after surgical tendon transfers.|83578000|264983002

Despite the unpredictable aspect
in incomplete lesions tendon transfers|255599008|264983002|255609007|264983002
may
be
useful.

The surgeon|304292004
should
be
confident|225486005
that
the muscle to|91727004
be
transferred|129347002
has
enough power|33300005
and
is
under good voluntary control.|20572008|255375007|31509003

Pre-operative assessment|262068006|386053000
is
more difficult to|242762006|52925006
assess
in incomplete lesions.|255599008|255609007

Patients|116154003
with an incomplete lesion also often|255599008|70232002|255609007|70232002
need|410525008|103325001
therapy|276239002
or
surgery|83578000
before the procedure to|71388002
restore
function|246464006
to correct
the consequences|103332005
of the injury.

These consequences|103332005
are
hypertonicity/spasticity,|56731001|397790002
contractures,|55033002
painful hyperesthesias|22253000|14151009
and
paralyzed|44695005
proximal upper limb muscles|40415009|53120007|91727004|40415009|182245002|91727004
with distal muscle sparing.|46053002|91727004

Spasticity|397790002
is
a frequent consequence|70232002|103332005
of incomplete injuries.|255599008|255609007

Spasticity often|397790002|70232002
decreases|260370003
function,|246464006
but
sometimes
a patient|116154003
can
control|31509003
the spasticity|397790002
in a way
that
it
is
useful
to their function.|246464006

The location|246267002
and
the effect|253861007
of the spasticity|397790002
should
be
analyzed
carefully
before
treatment|276239002|416118004
is
planned.|397943006

An injection|28289002|385218009|129326001
of Botulinum toxin (Botox)|419254007|404909007
into spastic muscles|263875003|91727004
is
a treatment to|276239002|416118004
reduce|260400001
spasticity.|397790002

This
can
be
used|394850002
to
prevent
muscle shorting|91727004|228211007|91727004|359530003|91727004|367450005
and
early contractures.[4]|264499004|55033002

Over the last ten years|23067006|258707000|420258001|258707000
an increase|260366006
in traumatic incomplete lesions|263904004|255599008|263904004|255609007
is
seen,
due to the better protection|3442003
in traffic.

Although
the most obvious symptom|4757001
is
impairment|40226000
to the limbs,|66019005
functioning|246464006
is
also
impaired|260379002|40226000
in the torso.|22943007

This
can
mean|255586005
a loss
or
impairment|40226000
in controlling bowel|54776003|261093006|31509003|261093006
and
bladder,|89837001|302512001
sexual function,|76859005
digestion,|106079008
breathing|14910006|258162000
and
other autonomic functions.|74964007|72167002|246464006

Furthermore,
sensation|106148006|271712005|272144002
is
usually
impaired|260379002|40226000
in affected areas.|247591002|42798000|248448006|42798000

This
can
manifest|250255003
as numbness,|398026008|44077006
reduced sensation|398026008
or
burning neuropathic pain._[citation|247398009|90673000|247398009|62404004|247398009

_]

Secondarily,
because of their depressed functioning|366979004|246464006
and
immobility,|102491009
tetraplegics
are
often more vulnerable to pressure sores,|70232002|420226006
osteoporosis|64859006
and
fractures,|125605004
frozen joints,|111227009
spasticity,|397790002
respiratory complications|62907002
and
infections,
autonomic dysreflexia,|129618003
[5] deep vein thrombosis,|264706000|128053003|264706000|404223003|264605009|128053003|264605009|404223003
and
cardiovascular disease.[6]|49601007

Severity|272141005
depends
on both
the level|258395000|276625007
at which
the spinal cord|2748008|180959008
is
injured
and
the extent|255590007
of the injury.

An individual|125676002|385435006
with an injury
at C1
(
the highest cervical vertebra,|75540009|122494005|75540009|181820005|371879000|122494005|371879000|181820005
at the base
of the skull|89546000
)
,
will
probably
lose
function|246464006
from the neck|45048000|302550007
down
and
be
ventilator-dependent.|371154000|23562009|371154000

An individual|125676002|385435006
with a C7 injury
may
lose
function|246464006
from the chest|261179002
down
but
still
retain|397909002
use|277889008|419385000
of the arms|40983000
and
much
of the hands.|85562004

The extent|255590007
of the injury
is
also important.

A complete severing|255594003
of the spinal cord|2748008|180959008
will
result|394617004
in complete loss|255594003
of function|246464006
from that vertebra|420345000|181817002
down.

A partial severing|255609007
or
even
bruising|125667009
of the spinal cord|2748008|180959008
results|394617004
in varying degrees|246173007
of mixed function|26242008|246464006
and
paralysis.|44695005

A common misconception|72906007
with Tetraplegia|11538006
is
that
the victim
cannot
move|302000008|384598002|370125004
legs,|30021000
arms|40983000
or
any
of the major function|255603008|246464006
;
this
is
often|70232002
not
the case.|398241000

Some tetraplegic individuals|125676002|385435006
can
walk|129006008
and
use|277889008|419385000
their hands,|85562004
as though
they
did
not
have
a spinal cord injury,|90584004
while
others|74964007
may
use|277889008|419385000
wheelchairs|58938008
and
they
can
still
have
function|246464006
of their arms|40983000
and
mild finger movement,|255604002|7569003|255324009|255604002|302541005|255324009
again,
that
varies
on the spinal cord damage.|2748008|37782003|180959008|37782003

It
is
common to|72906007
have
movement|255324009
in limbs,|66019005
such as the ability to|371150009
move|302000008|384598002|370125004
the arms|40983000
but
not
the hands|85562004
or
to
be
able to|371150009
use|277889008|419385000
the fingers|7569003|259052003
but
not
to the same extent,|262126009|255590007
as
before
the injury.

Furthermore,
the deficit|260372006|248325000
in the limbs|66019005
may
not
be
the same|262126009
on
both
sides|182353008
of the body|279495008|123037004
;
either
left|7771000
or
right side|24028007
may
be
more
affected|247591002|248448006
,
depending
on the location|246267002
of the lesion
on the spinal cord.|2748008|180959008

There
are
about 5,000 cervical spinal cord injuries|405754008
per year|258707000|259039008
in the United States|223688001
(~1|260305007
in 60,000?
assuming
a population|385436007|389109008
of 300 million
)
,
and
about 1,000
per year|258707000|259039008
in the UK
(also ~1
in 60,000?
assuming
a population|385436007|389109008
of 60 million
).

In 1988,
it
was
estimated|414135002
that lifetime care
of a 27-year-old rendered tetraplegic|258707000|70753007|259039008|70753007
was
about
US $1 million|260305007
and
that
the total national costs|258755000|255619001
were
US $5.6 billion|260271001
per year._[citation|258707000|259039008
needed|410525008|103325001
_]
It currently|15240007
costs
between $520,000
to $550,000
per year to|258707000|259039008
care
for a ventilator dependent tetraplegic.[7]|371154000|23562009|371154000

Upper limb paralysis refers|53120007|44695005|439980006|182245002|44695005|439980006
to the loss
of function|246464006
of the elbow|127949000|16953009|76248009
and
hand.|85562004|302539009

When
upper limb function|53120007|246464006|182245002|246464006
is
absent|2667000
as a result|394617004
of a spinal cord injury|90584004
it
is
a major barrier to|255603008
regain
autonomy.|72167002

There
are
possibilities
for tetraplegic hand|85562004|302539009
and
elbow surgery|45009000
which
allow
restoration|260938008
of upper limb function.|53120007|246464006|182245002|246464006

At the 2007 world congress
in reconstructive hand surgery|122465003|85562004|122465003|302539009|112746006
and
rehabilitation|52052004|394602003
in tetraplegia|11538006
a resolution
was
presented|246105001
and
accepted|385645004
that
indicates|410535002
that
every person|125676002
with tetraplegia|11538006
should
be
examined|64049009
and
informed|410938009|223458004
concerning
the options
for reconstructive surgery|122465003
of the tetraplegic arms|40983000
and
hands.|85562004

With this resolution
it
becomes
clear|263707001
that
it
is
necessary to
increase|260366006
the awareness|312012004
on this subject.

These surgical procedures|83578000
are
further|46053002
discussed
in Upper-limb surgery|53120007|83578000|182245002|83578000
in tetraplegia.|11538006

Delayed diagnosis|439401001
of cervical spine injury|262522002
has
grave consequences|103332005
for the victim.

About one|421379005
in 20 cervical fractures|125606003
are
missed
and
about two-thirds|420797005|70905002
of these patients|116154003
have
further spinal-cord damage|46053002|2748008|37782003|46053002|180959008|37782003
as a result.|394617004

About 30%
of cases|398241000|413769002
of delayed diagnosis|439401001
of cervical spine injury|262522002
develop
permanent neurological deficits.|6934004|264552009

In high-level cervical injuries,|75540009|258395000|261064006|75540009|276625007|261064006|371879000|258395000|261064006|371879000|276625007|261064006

can
result.|394617004

(C4
and
higher|75540009|371879000

will
likely|2931005
need|410525008|103325001
constant care
and
assistance|116697009
in activities|257733005
of daily living,|69620002
such as getting
dressed|333453004|3895009|228204008|165235000|129003000

eating|48263008

slight movement|255510006|255324009|255604002|255324009

be
regained
through "rewiring" neural connections,|3057000|263538003|256864008|263538003
