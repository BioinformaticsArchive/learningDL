*Hereditary stomatocytosis|14087004

describes
a number|410680006|410681005
of inherited autosomal dominant human conditions|255404009|263681008|278412004|260905004
which
affect|4065008
the red blood cell,|41898006
in which
the membrane|83097008
or
outer coating|261074009
of the cell '|4421005|362837007
leaks|87952002
' sodium|39972003
and
potassium ions.|88480006|48006008

Osmosis|47410001
leads|88488004|236874000
to the red blood cell|41898006
having
a constant tendency
to swell|423666004|442672001
and
burst.|255331008

This tendency
is
countered|303502004
by manipulating|129408000
the flow
of sodium|39972003
and
potassium ions.|88480006|48006008

A '
pump|44668000
'
forces
sodium|39972003
out of the cell|4421005|362837007
and
potassium|88480006
in,
and
this action|129264002
is
balanced|78933003
by a process|415178003
called '
the passive leak'.|87952002

In the hereditary stomatocytoses,|14087004
the passive leak|87952002
is
increased|35105006|260366006
and
the cell|4421005|362837007
becomes
swamped|111059006
with salt|387390002
and
water.|11713004|119318008

The cell lyses|4421005|371757000|362837007|371757000
and
a haemolytic anaemia results.|61261009|394617004

For
as yet unknown reasons,|261665006|410666004
the cells|4421005
take|419652001
on an abnormal shape,|20967005
resembling
a mouth|74262004|123851003|21082005|181220002
or
'stoma'.|245857005

Haematologists|40204001
have
identified|7882003
a number|410680006|410681005
of variants.|40885006

These
can
be
classified|73504009
as
below.

There
are
other families|74964007|35359004
that
do
not
fall|1912002
neatly
into any
of these classifications.[1]|73504009

Stomatocytosis|3272007
is
also
found|404684003
as a hereditary disease|32895009
in Alaskan malamute|53228008
and
miniature schnauzer dogs.[2]|300004|448771007|300004

At present there|52101004|246105001
is
no specific treatment.|69658003|276239002|69658003|416118004

Many patients|260396001|116154003
with haemolytic anaemia|61261009
take|419652001
folic acid|63718003|104660009
(vitamin B9|104660009
)
since
the greater turnover|263768009|261032004
of cells|4421005
consumes
this vitamin.|87708000

During crises transfusion|32937002|32937002|303955003|32937002|116859006|32937002|5447007
may
be
required.

Clotting problems|55607006
can
occur|272120004
for which anticoagulation|372862008
may
be
needed.|410525008|103325001

The cause|134198009
for these hereditary conditions|255404009|260905004
is
now
understood|66216009
to
be
various mutations|256220008|55446002
in the erythrocyte membrane protein,|41898006|83097008|88878007
band 3.|77541009|255281001

It
is
this protein|88878007
which
mediates|73510009
the cation leaks|31046007|87952002
which
are
characteristic
of this disease.[3]|64572001
