*Priapism|6273006
*
*
(/?pra??p?z?m/[1][2]
)
is
a potentially painful medical condition,|22253000|74188005|260905004
in which
the erect penis|18911002|265793009
or
clitoris[3]|65439009|181442003
does
not
return|7528007
to its flaccid state,|264938003|398070004
despite
the absence|2667000|418560003
of
both
physical|5880005|19388002
and
psychological stimulation,|60224009|122545008
within four hours.|421534005|258702006

There
are
two types|420797005|261664005
of priapism|6273006
:
low-flow|62482003|371880002
and
high-flow|75540009|371879000
;
80%
to 90%|264705001|264703008
of clinically presented priapisms|246105001|6273006
are
low flow disorders.|62482003|64572001|371880002|64572001

Low-flow|62482003|371880002
involves|248448006
the blood|87612001|119273009
not adequately
returning|7528007
to the body|279495008|123037004
from the organ.|410653004

High-flow|75540009|371879000
involves|248448006
a
short-circuit|359530003|367450005
of the vascular system partway|59820001|246333005
along the organ.|410653004

Treatment|276239002|416118004
is
different|263735002
for each type.|261664005

Priapism|6273006
is
considered
a medical emergency,|74188005|25876001
which
should
receive
proper treatment|276239002|416118004
by a qualified medical practitioner.|158965000

Early treatment|264499004|276239002|264499004|416118004
can
be
beneficial
for a functional recovery.|40143009|246464006

The duration|103335007
of a normal erection|17621005|60704006|258744000|60704006
before
it
is
classifiable
as priapism|6273006
is
still controversial.

Ongoing|255238004
penile erections|60704006
for more
than 6 hours|123033000
can
be
classified|73504009
as priapism.[4]|6273006

The name
comes
from the Greek god Priapus|1451003
(Ancient Greek|1451003
: ???????
)
,
a fertility god often|397594008|70232002|8619003|70232002|87727006|70232002
represented
with a disproportionately large|255509001
and
permanent erection.|6934004|60704006

The causative mechanisms|257544000
are
poorly|556001
understood|66216009
but
involve|248448006
complex neurological|103360007|1199008
and
vascular factors.|59820001

Priapism|6273006
may
be
associated|47429007
with haematological disorders,|34093004
especially sickle-cell disease,|417357006
sickle-cell trait,|16402000
and
other conditions|74964007|260905004
such as leukemia,|87163000
thalassemia,|40108008
and
Fabry's disease,|16652001
and
neurologic disorders|118940003
such as spinal cord lesions|2748008|180959008
and
spinal cord trauma|90584004
(priapism|6273006
has
been
reported|229059009|223458004
in hanging victims
;
see|281004000
death erection.|419620001|60704006|268923008|60704006

Priapism|6273006
may
also
be
associated|47429007
with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency,|124134002
which
leads|88488004|236874000
to decreased NADPH.|1250004|131144006|260400001|131144006|260371004|131144006

NADPH|131144006
is
a co-factor
involved|248448006
in the formation|11798007|255277001
of nitric oxide,|409378005
therefore glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency|124134002
will
lower|261122009
nitric oxide levels,|409378005|258395000
which
may
result|394617004
in priapism.|6273006

Recent breakthroughs|6493001|255298001
in research
of the disease|64572001
have
pointed
to a raised level|260399008|258395000|260399008|276625007
of the biochemical adenosine|80534008|35431001
being
the cause|134198009
of the condition.|260905004

This
seems
to
cause|23981006|134198009
blood vessels to|59820001
dilate|255381004
and
has
the potential to|30207005
influence
blood flow|58190003
into the penis.[6]|18911002|265793009

Sickle cell disease often|417357006|70232002
presents|52101004|246105001
special treatment obstacles.|67995009|276239002|67995009|416118004

Hyperbaric oxygen therapy|18678000
has
also
been
used|394850002
with success|385669000
in some patients.|116154003

Priapism|6273006
is
also
found|404684003
to
occur|272120004
in extreme cases|12565001|398241000|12565001|413769002
of rabies.|14168008|396437008

Priapism|6273006
can
also
be
caused|23981006|134198009
by reactions|263851003
to medications.|410942007

The most common medications|4757001|72906007|410942007
that
cause|23981006|134198009
priapism|6273006
are
intra-cavernous injections|272114000|76196003|28289002|272114000|76196003|129326001
for treatment|276239002|416118004
of erectile dysfunction|397803000
(papaverine,|372784001

Priapism|6273006
has
also
been
linked
to achalasia._[citation|45564002|48531003
needed|410525008|103325001
_] Priapism|6273006
is
also
known|36692007
to
occur|272120004
from bites|3404009
of the Brazilian wandering spider|106862001
and
the black widow spider.|285590003

PDE-5 inhibitors|407313002
have
been
evaluated
as preventive treatment|169443000
for recurrent priapism.[8][9]|442584007

Recently,|6493001
the vibration|271421005|33679000
of BMW motorcycles|90748009
manufactured
in 1993,
coupled
with a Corbin aftermarket seat,
has
been
claimed
as the cause|134198009
for Priapism|6273006
for one California resident.[10]|421379005|224043007|405277009|421379005|25997004|405277009

Potential complications|30207005|116223007
include|55919000
ischemia,|52674009
clotting
of the blood|87612001|119273009
retained|397909002
in the penis|18911002|265793009
(thrombosis,|118927008
and
damage|37782003
to the blood vessels|59820001
of the penis|18911002|265793009
which
may
result|394617004
in an impaired erectile function|260379002|60704006|246464006|40226000|60704006|246464006
or
impotence.|397803000

In serious cases,|42745003|398241000|42745003|413769002
the ischemia|52674009
may
result|394617004
in gangrene,|372070002
which
could
necessitate
penis removal.|18911002|118292001|18911002|128303001|265793009|118292001|265793009|128303001

Medical advice|74188005|420227002
should
be
sought
immediately|49499008
for cases|398241000|413769002
of erection|60704006
beyond four hours.|421534005|258702006

Generally,
this
is
done
at an emergency department.|225728007

In sickle cell patients|49938009|116154003
with priapism,|6273006
the first step in management|255216001|398298007|413454004|255216001|398298007|119270007|232714002|398298007|413454004|232714002|398298007|119270007
is
a blood exchange transfusion,|39188002
not
a surgical intervention.|83578000

For other patients,|74964007|116154003
orally administered pseudoephedrine|260548002|418283001|372900003|260548002|418283001|105313001
may
be
effective, pseudoephedrine|255403003|372900003|255403003|105313001|254648000|372900003|254648000|105313001
being
an alpha-agonist,|263660008|102498003
agent|260872001
that
exert|19487008
a constriction effect|27551008|253861007
on smooth muscle|122447002
of corpora cavernosum,|9284003|245468004
that in turn|282987006
facilitate
venous outflow.|29092000|263925004

Likewise,
other sympathomimetic drugs|74964007|372884008
of the amphetamine class|373338002|258391009|258391009
have
been
observed
to
induce|16404004
erectile dysfunction,|397803000
although
in a small number|255507004|410680006|255507004|410681005
of cases|398241000|413769002
they
may
have
the opposite effect.|253861007

Otherwise,
the therapy|276239002
at this stage|21191007|371508000|261612004
is
to
aspirate|119295008
blood|87612001|119273009
from the corpus cavernosum|9284003|245468004
under local anaesthetic.|386761002|373477003

If
this
is
still insufficient, then intracavernosal injections|71978007|28289002|71978007|129326001|423437008|28289002|423437008|129326001
of phenylephrine|372771005
are
administered.|418283001

This
should
only
be
performed|398166005
by a specialist|309395003
trained|118629009|62193008
in the procedure,|71388002
with the patient|116154003
under constant hemodynamic monitoring,|48428001
as
phenylephrine|372771005
can
cause|23981006|134198009
severe hypertension,|24484000|38341003
bradycardia,|48867003
tachycardia,|3424008|6285003
and
arrhythmia.

Terbutaline|372745006
being
a beta-2 agonist|52095000|102498003|260989008|102498003
causes|134198009
smooth muscle relaxation|372894003
;
in priapism|6273006
it probably
acts
by relaxation
of the stretched corporeal smooth muscles,|386781001|279495008|122447002|386781001|123037004|122447002|122546009|279495008|122447002|122546009|123037004|122447002
or
increasing permeability|260369004|82540007
of erectile cavernous tissue|60704006|76196003|85756007
permitting|958006
easy flow|36203004
of fluid|32457005|33463005|255765007
from sinusoids|263871007
into the venous system.|119553000

In priapism,|6273006
it
was
suggested
to
be
administered|418283001
orally.[11]|260548002

Methylene blue|6725000
is
used intracavernously to|394850002
treat|395077000
priapism,|6273006
but
it
should
not
be
used|394850002
in treatment|52101004|276239002|52101004|416118004|18720000|276239002|18720000|416118004
of recurrent priapism|442584007
or
fibrosis|263756000
because
it
can
induce|16404004
penile necrosis.|18911002|6574001

Temporary blue discoloration|14803004|405738005|47415006
of the penis|18911002|265793009
is
also
of concern.[11]

If aspiration|14910006|278847003|129316008|68052005
fails
and
tumescence recurs,|442672001|246455001
surgical shunts|83578000|442119001|83578000|257351008|83578000|125319009
are
next|18769003|255260001
attempted.

These attempt to
reverse
the priapic state|6273006|398070004
by shunting blood|88834003|87612001|88834003|119273009
from the rigid corpora cavernosa|16046003|9284003|261026009|9284003
into the corpus spongiosum|279712008|25270003
(
which
contains|42504009
the glans
and
the urethra.|264255005|302513006

Distal shunts|46053002|442119001|46053002|257351008|46053002|125319009
are
the first step,|255216001|398298007|232714002|398298007
followed|367409002
by more proximal shunts.|242762006|40415009|442119001|242762006|40415009|257351008|242762006|40415009|125319009

Distal shunts,|46053002|442119001|46053002|257351008|46053002|125319009
such as the Winter's,
_[clarification
needed|410525008|103325001
_]
involve|248448006
puncturing|11639007|85921004
the glans
(
the distal part|46053002|260726005
of the penis|18911002|265793009
)
into one|421379005
of the cavernosa,
where
the old,|70753007
stagnant blood|87612001|119273009
is
held.|421139008

This
causes|134198009
the blood to|87612001|119273009
leave|7771000|90737002
the penis|18911002|265793009
and
return|7528007
to the circulation.|413854007

This procedure|71388002
can
be
performed|398166005
by a urologist|24590004
at the bedside.

Winter's shunts|442119001|257351008|125319009
are
often|70232002
the first invasive technique|255216001|10179008|272394005|232714002|10179008|272394005
used|394850002
,
especially
in hematologic induced priapism,|16404004|6273006|57407000|16404004|6273006
as
it
is
relatively simple|13673007
and
repeatable|27582007
over time.[12]|410669006

Proximal shunts,|40415009|442119001|40415009|257351008|40415009|125319009
such as the Quackel's,
_[clarification

are
more
involved|248448006
and
entail operative dissection|122459003
in the perineum|261157007|243990009
to where
the corpora|23952005
meet|229057006
the spongiosum,
making
an incision|34896006
in both,
and
suturing|18557009
both
openings together.[13]|56116003

Shunts|442119001|257351008|125319009

between corpora cavernosa|9284003
and
saphenous vein|362072009|60734001
called
Grayhack shunt|442119001|257351008|125319009
can
be
done
though
rarely._[citation|103356009

As the complication|116223007|263718001
of shortened,|359530003
indurated
and
non-erectile penis|60704006|18911002|60704006|265793009
is
high|75540009|371879000
in prolonged priapism,|255224006|6273006
early penile prosthesis implantation|264499004|47411002
can
be
performed.|398166005

Apart from early resumption|264499004
of sexual activity,|365952006
early implantation|264499004|71861002|264499004|25602002
can
avoid
the formation|11798007|255277001
of dense fibrosis|255596001|263756000
