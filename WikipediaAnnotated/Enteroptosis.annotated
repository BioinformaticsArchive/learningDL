of the abdominal viscera|19203006|361295005
(internal organs|260521003|410653004
)
below their natural position.|510009|246449006

Any
or
all
of the organs|410653004

of muscular tone,|6918002
particularly
of the abdominal muscles,|28720001
intestinal autointoxication,|261093006|61767007

the viscera|276434005
in place.|257557008|421066005
