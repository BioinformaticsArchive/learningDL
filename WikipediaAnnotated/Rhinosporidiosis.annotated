is
an infection
caused|23981006|134198009
by _Rhinosporidium seeberi_.[1][2]|48600001

This organism|410653004
was
previously
considered
to
be
a fungus,|414561005
and
rhinosporidiosis|18140003
is
classified|73504009
as a fungal disease|3218000
under ICD-10.|70199000

It
is
now
considered
to
be
a parasite,|37763007
[3]|260313008
classified|73504009
under Mesomycetozoea.[4]|370571000

Authors|308004006
of detailed studies|110465008|224699009
have
revealed superficial similarities|263857004|26283006
between _Dermocystidium_
and
_Rhinosporidium_|65470001
when
using|260676000
light microscopy,|104157003
but
substantial morphological differences|116676008|263735002|72724002|263735002
between the groups|261586004|160481000
exist.[5]

There
is
some evidence|18669006
that DNA|24851008
extracted|62972009
from purified uncontaminated round bodies|42700002|279495008|42700002|123037004
(Rhinosporidium seeberi|48600001
)
is
of cyanobacterium origin.[6]|415101005|255395001

Rhinosporidiosis|18140003
is
a granulomatous disease|128561003
affecting|247591002|248448006
the mucous membrane|313268005
of nasopharynx,|264105008|181200003
oropharynx,|31389004|263376008
conjunctiva,|29445007|181161008
rectum|34402009|181261002
and
external genitalia.|45292006|77142006

Though
the floor
of the nose|260540009|181195007
and
inferior turbinate|6553002
are
the commonest sites,|72906007|10546003
the lesions
may
appear
in elsewhere too.

Traumatic inoculation|263904004
from one site|421379005|10546003
to others|74964007
is
common.|72906007

Laryngeal rhinosporidiosis [7] too|261115001|18140003|420185003|18140003
has
been
described
and
may
be
due to inoculation
from the nose|260540009|181195007
during endotracheal intubation.|112798008

After inoculation
the organism|410653004
replicate|1305003|27582007
locally
resulting|42752001
in the hyperplasia|76197007
of host tissue|85756007
and
localised immune response.|255471002|35024006

Disease|64572001
endemic
in South India,|223600005
Sri Lanka,|223604001
South America|223504005
and
Africa.|223498002

It
is
presumed to
be
transmitted|60117003|258150004
by exposure|71677004|24932003
to the pathogen|264418008
when
taking|419652001
a bath
in stagnant water pools.|11713004|69297003|119318008|69297003
