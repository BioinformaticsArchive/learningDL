Historically,
probably
the most commonly studied cases|4757001|398241000|4757001|413769002
of two-phase flow|420797005|21191007
are
in large-scale power systems.|255509001|19892000|33300005|246333005|255509001|278111002|33300005|246333005

Coal|34323004
and
gas-fired power stations|257203002|284558000
used|394850002
very large boilers to|258262008|15873008
produce
steam|27177009
for use|277889008|419385000
in turbines.

In such cases,|398241000|413769002
pressurised water|11713004|119318008
is
passed
through heated pipes|88999006
and
it
changes|243326001|263703002
to
steam|27177009
as
it
moves|302000008
through the pipe.

The design
of boilers|15873008
requires
a detailed understanding|66216009
of two-phase flow heat-transfer|420797005|21191007|88999006|302265009
and
pressure drop behaviour,|279046003|404218003|844005|13543005|404218003|844005|257893003|404218003|844005
which
is
significantly different|263735002
from the single-phase case.|125681006|21191007|398241000|50607009|21191007|398241000

Even more critically,
nuclear reactors|66096004
use|277889008|419385000
water to|11713004|119318008
remove|127485006
heat|88999006
from the reactor core|260235002
using|260676000
two-phase flow.|420797005|21191007

A great deal|255509001|263768009
of study|110465008|224699009
has
been
performed|398166005
on the nature|277302009
of two-phase flow|420797005|21191007
in such cases,|398241000|413769002
so
that engineers|106269003
can
design
against possible failures|371930009|76797004|60022001|76797004
in pipework,
loss
of pressure,|279046003|13543005|257893003
and
so|223528007
on
(
a loss-of-coolant accident (LOCA)|55566008
).[1]|260305007

Another case|398241000
where two-phase flow|420797005|21191007
can
occur|272120004
is
in pump cavitation.|44668000|2483006

Here
a pump|44668000
is
operating
close|29179001
to the vapor pressure|285402002
of the fluid|32457005|33463005|255765007
being
pumped.|44668000

If pressure drops further,|279046003|426684005|46053002|279046003|404218003|46053002|13543005|426684005|46053002|13543005|404218003|46053002|257893003|426684005|46053002|257893003|404218003|46053002
which
can
happen locally
near the vanes|224832000
for the pump,|44668000
for example,
then
a phase change|21191007|243326001|21191007|263703002
can
occur|272120004
and
gas|308698004|74947009
will
be
present|52101004|246105001
in the pump.|44668000

Similar effects|253861007
can
also
occur|272120004
on marine propellors
;
wherever
it
occurs|272120004
,
it
is
a serious problem|42745003|55607006
for designers.

When
the vapor bubble collapses,|16277007
it
can
produce
very large pressure spikes,|258262008|279046003|258262008|13543005|258262008|257893003
which over time|21481007|410669006
will
cause|23981006|134198009
damage|37782003
on the propellor
or
turbine.

The above two-phase flow cases|261183002|420797005|21191007|398241000|261183002|420797005|21191007|413769002
are
for a single fluid|125681006|32457005|125681006|33463005|125681006|255765007|125681006|50607009|32457005|50607009|33463005|50607009|255765007|50607009
occurring|272120004
by itself
as
two different phases,|420797005|263735002|272108007
such as steam|27177009
and
water.|11713004|119318008

The term 'two-phase flow'|420797005|21191007
is
also
applied|410618006
to mixtures|272163001
of different fluids|263735002|32457005|263735002|33463005
having
different phases,|263735002|272108007
such as air|417696007
and
water,|11713004|119318008
or
oil|21847005|421890007
and
natural gas.|2698003

Sometimes even _three_-phase flow|421291004|21191007
is
considered,
such as
in oil|21847005|421890007
and
gas pipelines|308698004|74947009
where there
might
be
a significant fraction|386134007|278277004
of solids.|35702001|78910004

Other interesting areas|74964007|225469004|42798000
where two-phase flow|420797005|21191007
is
studied|110465008|224699009
includes|55919000
in climate systems|246333005
such as clouds,|81858005
[1]|260305007
and
in groundwater flow,
in which
the movement|255324009
of water|11713004|119318008
and
air|417696007
through the soil|415555003
is
studied.|110465008|224699009

Other examples|74964007
of two-phase flow|420797005|21191007
include|55919000
bubbles,
rain,
waves
on the sea,|225742004
foam,|421166008
fountains,
mousse,|227734001
cryogenics,
and
oil slicks.|21847005|421890007

Several features|261028005
make
two-phase flow|420797005|21191007
an interesting|225469004
and
challenging branch|127484005
of fluid mechanics|32457005|261018001|33463005|261018001|255765007|261018001|261018001
:

Gurgling|24436009
is
a characteristic sound|68325009
made
by unstable two-phase fluid flow,|263922001|420797005|21191007|32457005|263922001|420797005|21191007|33463005|263922001|420797005|21191007|255765007|263922001|420797005|21191007
for example,
as
liquid|33463005|264312008
is
poured
from a bottle,|68276009|419672006
or
during gargling.|31105004

Modelling
of two phase flow|420797005|21191007

under development.|278923009
