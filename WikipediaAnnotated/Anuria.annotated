*Anuria|2472002
*
* means nonpassage|255586005
of urine,|78014005
[1] in practice|260305007
is
defined
as passage|255592004
of less|276139006|263796003
than 50 milliliters|258773002
of urine|78014005
in a day.|258703001|259032004

Anuria|2472002
is
often|70232002
caused|23981006|134198009
by failure|76797004
in the function|246464006
of kidneys.|64033007|17373004

It
may
also
occur|272120004
because of some severe obstruction|24484000|26036001
like kidney stones|95570007|444717006
or
tumours.|108369006

It
may
occur|272120004
with end stage renal disease.|46177005|433146000

It
is
a more extreme reduction|242762006|12565001|58294000|242762006|12565001|260400001|242762006|12565001|289928003
than oliguria,|83128009
sometimes
called
anuresis.

Failure|76797004
of kidney function,|11953005
which
can
have
multiple causes|260396001|134198009
including|55919000
medications|410942007
or
toxins|80917008
(
e.g.
,
antifreeze|311922005
)
;
diabetes|73211009
;
high blood pressure.|38341003

Stones|384600008
or
tumours|108369006
in the urinary tract|122489005
can
also
cause|23981006|134198009
it
by creating
an obstruction|26036001
to urinary flow.|162182005

High blood calcium,|75540009|312472004|371879000|312472004
oxalate,|430774002
or
uric acid,|1710001|86228006
can
contribute
to the risk|30207005
of stone formation.|384600008|11798007|384600008|255277001

In males,|248153007
an enlarged prostate gland|30746006|263847000|30746006|181422007|249607009|362884007|260376009|263847000|118452000|263847000
is
a common cause|72906007|134198009
of obstructive anuria.|263821009|2472002

Acute anuria,|272118002|2472002
where
the decline
in urine production|78014005
occurs|272120004
quickly,
is
usually
a sign|72670004
of obstruction|26036001
or
acute renal failure.|14669001

Acute renal failure|14669001
can
be
caused|23981006|134198009
by factors
not
related|272151006|262094002
to the kidney,|64033007|17373004|181414000
such as heart failure,|84114007|42343007
mercury poisoning,|85180002
infection,
and
other conditions|74964007|260905004
that
cause|23981006|134198009
the kidney to|64033007|17373004|181414000
be
deprived
of blood flow.|58190003

Anuria|2472002
itself
is
a symptom,
not
a disease.|64572001

It
is
often|70232002
associated|47429007
with other symptoms|74964007
of kidney failure,|42399005
such as lack|41277001
of appetite,|33911006
weakness,|13791008|260407003
nausea|422587007
and
vomiting.|249497008

These
are
mostly
the result|394617004
of buildup
of toxins|80917008
in the blood|87612001|119273009
which
would
normally
be
removed|127485006
by healthy kidneys.|263775005|64033007|263775005|17373004

Treatment|276239002|416118004
is
dependent|371154000
on the underlying cause|134198009
of this symptom.

The most easily treatable cause|4757001|36203004|134198009
is
obstruction|26036001
of urine flow,|17328006
which
is
often|70232002
solved
by insertion|71861002|257867005
of a urinary catheter|20568009
into the urinary bladder.|89837001

Mannitol|387168006
is
a medicine|410942007
that
is
used to|394850002
increase|260366006
the amount|107651007
of water|11713004|119318008
removed|127485006
from the blood|87612001|119273009
and
thus
improve|385425000|3442003|385633008
the blood flow|58190003
to the kidneys.|64033007|17373004

However,
mannitol|387168006
is
contraindicated|410536001
in anuria|2472002
secondary|2603003|81170007
to renal disease,|90708001
severe dehydration,|24484000|34095006
intracranial bleeding|1386000
(
unless
during craniotomy|25353009
)
,
severe pulmonary congestion,|24484000|67599009
or
pulmonary edema.|19242006

Dextrose|67079006
and
Dobutamine|387145002
are
both
used|394850002
to
increase|260366006
blood flow|58190003
to the kidney|64033007|17373004|181414000
and
act
within 30
to 60 minutes.|258701004|255507004|356624006
