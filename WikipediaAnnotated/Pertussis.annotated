k?f/ ?|372639009
is
a highly contagious bacterial disease|75540009|191415002|409822003
caused|23981006|134198009
by _Bordetella pertussis_.|5247005

In some countries,|223369002
this disease|64572001
is
called
the 100 days' cough|258703001|272039006
or
cough|272039006
of 100 days.[1]|258703001

Symptoms
are
initially mild,|884001|255604002
and
then
develop
into severe coughing fits,|24484000|43025008
which
produce
the namesake high-pitched "whoop" sound|51406002|60537006|51406002|60537006|68325009
in infected babies|418119000
and
children|410601007|160499008
when
they
inhale|421134003
air|417696007
after coughing.|272039006

The coughing stage lasts approximately six weeks|272039006|21191007|26175008|422218008|258705008|272039006|371508000|26175008|422218008|258705008|272039006|261612004|26175008|422218008|258705008
before subsiding.

Prevention|169443000
by vaccination
is
of primary importance|63161005|261424001
given|419582001
the seriousness|42745003
of the disease|64572001
in children.|410601007|160499008

Although
treatment|276239002|416118004
is
of little direct benefit|255589003
to the person|125676002
infected
,
antibiotics|255631004
are
recommended
because
they
shorten|129350004|359530003
the duration|103335007
of infectiousness.

It
is
estimated|414135002
that
the disease currently|64572001|15240007
affects|4065008
48.5 million people yearly,|125676002|53281000
resulting|42752001
in nearly 295,000 deaths.[4]|419620001|268923008

The classic signs|255301002|72670004|255333006|72670004
of pertussis|27836007
are
a paroxysmal cough,|43025008
inspiratory whoop,|14910006|60537006
and
vomiting|249497008
after coughing.|272039006

The cough|272039006
from pertussis|27836007
has
been
documented|397934002
to
cause|23981006|134198009
subconjunctival hemorrhages,|78768009
rib fractures,|33737001
urinary incontinence,|165232002
hernias,|414403008
post-cough fainting,|272039006|271594007
and
vertebral artery dissection.|230730001

If there
is
vomiting|249497008
after a coughing spell|272039006|83166007
or
an inspiratory whooping sound|14910006|60537006|14910006|60537006|68325009
on coughing,|272039006
the likelihood|2931005
that
the illness|39104002
is
pertussis|27836007
is
nearly
doubled.|1305003

On the other hand,|74964007|85562004|74964007|302539009
the absence|2667000|418560003
of a paroxysmal cough|43025008
or
posttussive emesis|249497008
makes
it almost half
as likely.[5]|2931005

The incubation period|406646006
is
typically seven|420359007
to
ten|23067006|420258001
days|258703001
in infants|418119000
or
young children,|84422007|410601007|84422007|160499008
after
which there
are
usually mild respiratory symptoms,|255604002|161920001
mild coughing,|255604002|272039006
sneezing,|162367006
or
runny nose.|267101005

This
is
known|36692007
as the catarrhal stage.|21191007|371508000|261612004

After
one|421379005
to two weeks,|420797005|258705008
the coughing classically|272039006
develops
into uncontrollable fits,|91175000
each
with five to|421820001
ten|23067006|420258001
forceful coughs,|272039006|289114008|285653008|272039006|285653008|289114008
followed|367409002
by a high-pitched "whoop" sound|51406002|60537006|51406002|60537006|68325009
in younger children,|74489007
or
a gasping sound|23141003|23141003|68325009
in older children,|31114009
as
the patient|116154003
struggles
to
breathe|14910006|258162000
in afterwards
(paroxysmal stage|26593000|21191007|26593000|371508000|26593000|261612004
).

Fits|91175000
can
occur|272120004
on their own
or
can
be
triggered|410658008
by yawning,|248626009
stretching|122546009
,
laughing|51078006
,
eating|48263008
or
yelling
;
they usually
occur|272120004
in groups,|261586004|160481000
with multiple episodes|288528003
every hour|258702006|286551008
around the clock.

This stage usually|21191007|371508000|261612004
lasts
two|420797005
to eight weeks,|421825006|258705008
or
sometimes longer.|255511005

A gradual transition then|255343009
occurs|272120004
to the convalescent stage,|21191007|371508000|261612004
which usually
lasts
one|421379005
to two weeks.|420797005|258705008

This stage|21191007|371508000|261612004
is
marked|46998006
by a decrease|260400001|260370003
in paroxysms|26593000
of coughing,|272039006
both
in frequency|260864003|272123002
and
severity,|272141005
and
a cessation
of vomiting.|249497008

Methods|260686004|272394005
used|394850002
in laboratory diagnosis|52101004|46159000|18720000|46159000
include|55919000
culturing|252398009|61594008
of nasopharyngeal swabs|258500001
on Bordet-Gengou medium,|255508009
polymerase chain reaction (PCR),|258066000
direct immunofluorescence|127796002
(DFA
)
,
and
serological methods.|27377004|260686004|27377004|272394005

The bacteria|409822003
can
be
recovered|74822006
from the patient only|116154003
during the first three weeks|255216001|421291004|258705008|232714002|421291004|258705008
of illness,|39104002
rendering
culturing|252398009|61594008
and
DFA useless
after this period,|259037005
although
PCR|258066000|103338009
may
have
some limited usefulness|255469002
for an additional three weeks.|260364009|421291004|258705008

For most adults|133936004
and
adolescents,|133937008
who often|70232002
do
not
seek
medical care|74188005
until several weeks|261028005|258705008
into their illness,|39104002
serology|68793005
may
be
used|394850002
to
determine
whether antibody|68498002|112133008
against pertussis toxin|255834005
or
another component|246093002
of _B.

pertussis_|27836007
is
present|52101004|246105001
at high levels|75540009|258395000|371879000|258395000
in the blood|87612001|119273009
of the patient.|116154003

By this stage|21191007|371508000|261612004
they
have
been
contagious
for some weeks|258705008
and
may
have
spread|410677005
the infection
to many people.|125676002

Because of this,
adults,|133936004
who
are
not
in great danger|255509001|263768009
from pertussis,|27836007
are
increasingly
being
encouraged to
be
vaccinated.

A similar, milder disease|255604002|64572001
is
caused|23981006|134198009
by _[B.

parapertussis]
(/wiki/Bordetella_parapertussis|26183002
)
_.[6]

The primary method|63161005|260686004|63161005|272394005|261424001|260686004|261424001|272394005
of prevention|169443000
for pertussis|27836007
is
vaccination.

There
is
insufficient evidence to|71978007|18669006|423437008|18669006
determine
the effectiveness|255403003
of antibiotics|255631004
in those
who
have
been
exposed|24932003
but
are
without symptoms.

Prophylactic antibiotics,
however,
are
still frequently|70232002
used|394850002
in those
who
have
been
exposed|24932003
and
are
at high risk|15508007
of severe disease|24484000|64572001
(
such as infants|418119000
).[3]|260313008

Pertussis vaccines|396433007
are
effective,[8] routinely|255403003|254648000
recommended
by the World Health Organization[9]|263775005|21139007
and
the Center for Disease Control|26216008|64572001|31509003
and
Prevention,|169443000
[10]
and
saved
over half
a million
lives|224130005
in 2002.

The multi-component acellular pertussis vaccine,|260396001|246093002|396433007
for example,
is
between 71-85% effective|264699005|255403003|264699005|254648000
with greater effectiveness|263768009|255403003
for more severe disease.[8]|242762006|24484000|64572001

The duration|103335007
of protection
is
between five|421820001
to ten years.|23067006|258707000|420258001|258707000

This
covers|255334000
childhood,|68433009
which
is
the time|410669006
of greatest exposure|4757001|71677004|4757001|24932003
and
greatest risk|4757001|30207005
of death|419620001|268923008
from pertussis.|27836007

For children,|410601007|160499008
the immunizations|127785005
are
commonly
given|419582001
in combination|89780004
with immunizations|127785005
against tetanus,|76902006
diphtheria,|397428000
polio|398102009
and
haemophilus influenzae type B,|103442008
at ages two,|424144002|420797005
four,|421534005
six,|422218008
and
15?18 months.|258706009

A single later booster|125681006|260383002|50607009|260383002
is
given|419582001
at four|421534005
to six years|422218008|258707000
of age.|424144002

(
US
schedule|416151008|410538000|416774000
).

In the UK,
pertussis vaccinations|39343008
are
given|419582001
at 2,
3
and
4 months,|260308009|258706009
with a pre-school booster|161116001
at 3yrs 4 months|258706009

A 2011 study|110465008|224699009
by the CDC
indicated|410535002
that
the duration|103335007
of protection
may
only
last
three|421291004
to six years.|422218008|258707000

Dr.|309343006

Paul Offit,
chief
of the Director
of the Vaccine Education Center|398827000|266981003|26216008|398827000|409073007|26216008
at the Children's Hospital|82242000
of Philadelphia,
comments
that
the last pertussis vaccination people|39343008|125676002
receive
may
be
their booster
at age 11|424144002
or
12 years old.|258707000|70753007

However,
he
states|398070004
that
it
is
important
for adults to|133936004
have
immunity|58915005
as well, to|20572008
prevent
transmission|258150004
of the disease|64572001
to infants.[12]|418119000

The pertussis component|27836007|246093002
of the DPT vaccine|421245007|125580002
accounted
for most
of the minor local|410599005|255470001|255606000|255470001
and
systemic side effects|31099001
in many vaccinated infants|418119000
(
such as mild fever|255604002|386661006
or
soreness|247348008
at the injection site|13136005
).

Immunization|127785005
against pertussis|27836007
does
not
confer
lifelong immunity.|58915005

While
adults rarely|133936004|103356009
die|419620001|399069006|419099009
if
they
contract|78558002
pertussis|27836007
after the effects|253861007
of their childhood vaccinations|68433009
have
worn
off,
they
may
transmit|60117003
the disease|64572001
to people|125676002
at much higher risk|15508007
of injury
or
death.|419620001|268923008

To
reduce|260400001
morbidity
and
spread|410677005
of the disease,|64572001
Canada,|223686002
France,|223666001
the U.S.|223688001

and
Germany|223637004
have
approved pertussis vaccine booster shots.|9571008|396433007|28289002

The pertussis booster|27836007
for adults|133936004
is
combined|89780004
with a tetanus vaccine|412375000
and
diphtheria vaccine booster|428126001
;
this combination|89780004
is
abbreviated "Tdap"
(Tetanus,|76902006
diphtheria,|397428000
acellular pertussis|27836007
).

It
is
similar
to the childhood vaccine called "DTaP"|68433009|398827000
(Diphtheria,|397428000
Tetanus,|76902006
acellular Pertussis|27836007
)
,
with the main difference|63161005|263735002
that
the adult version|133936004|22303008
contains|42504009
smaller amounts|263796003|107651007|255507004|107651007
of the diphtheria|397428000
and
pertussis components?|27836007|246093002
this
is
indicated|410535002
in the name
by the use|277889008|419385000
of lower-case "d"|261122009|398241000
and
"p"|20304007
for the adult vaccine.|133936004|398827000

The lower-case "|261122009|398241000
a"
in each vaccine|398827000
indicates|410535002
that
the pertussis component|27836007|246093002
is
acellular,
or
cell-free,|4421005|37837009|362837007|37837009
which
improves|385425000|3442003|385633008
safety
by dramatically
reducing|260400001
the incidence
of side effects.

Adults|133936004
should
request|103320006|385644000
the Tdap
instead of just
a tetanus shot|76902006|28289002
in order to
receive
the multi-vaccine.|260396001|398827000

Infection
with pertussis|27836007
induces|16404004
incomplete natural immunity|255599008|510009|58915005|255609007|510009|58915005
that wanes
over time.|410669006

Natural immunity lasts|510009|58915005
longer|255511005
than vaccine-induced immunity,|398827000|16404004|58915005
with one study reporting maximum effectiveness|421379005|110465008|223458004|398303009|255403003|421379005|224699009|223458004|398303009|255403003
as long|255511005
as 20 years|258707000
in the former|9130008
and
12
in the latter.[14]

The newer acellular vaccine,|7147002|398827000
known|36692007
as DTaP,
has
greatly
reduced|260400001
the incidence
of adverse effects
compared
to the earlier "whole-cell" pertussis vaccine.[15]|264499004|260232004|4421005|396433007|264499004|260232004|362837007|396433007

In 2012,
a federal advisory panel|261586004
recommended
that
all U.S.|223688001

adults|133936004
receive
vaccination.

Later
that year,|258707000|259039008
health officials|263775005
in the UK
recommended
the vaccination
of pregnant women|255409004
(

protect
their unborn children.|410601007|160499008

Designed
to
protect
babies|418119000
from birth|3950001
until their first standard vaccination|255216001|232714002
at eight weeks|421825006|258705008
of age,|424144002
this vaccine|398827000
was
introduced|127487003
in response
to the ongoing outbreak|255238004|443684005
of pertussis|27836007
in the UK,
the worst|556001|367391008|230993007|390772001|231877006
in over|21481007
a decade.[17]

Persons|125676002
with pertussis|27836007
are
infectious
from the beginning|255395001
of the catarrhal stage|21191007|371508000|261612004
(runny nose,|267101005
sneezing,|162367006
low-grade fever,|304213008
symptoms
of the common cold|82272006|54150009
)
through the third week|70905002|258705008|70905002|259038000
after the onset|77374008
of paroxysms|26593000
(multiple, rapid coughs|260396001|255358001|272039006|260396001|255358001|289114008
)
or
until 5 days|264706000|258703001|264605009|258703001

A reasonable guideline|410666004
is
to
treat|395077000
persons|125676002
aged|424144002|105436006
>1 year|260305007|258707000|260305007|259039008
within 3 weeks|260313008|258705008
of cough onset|272039006|77374008
and
infants|418119000
aged|424144002|105436006
<1 year|260305007|258707000|260305007|259039008
and
pregnant women|255409004
(especially near term
)
within 6 weeks|258705008
of cough onset.|272039006|77374008

If
the patient|116154003
is
diagnosed late,|439401001|260383002
antibiotics|255631004
will
not
alter
the course|288524001
of the illness|39104002
and
,
even
without antibiotics,|255631004
the patient|116154003
should
no longer|255511005
be
spreading|410677005
pertussis.|27836007

Antibiotics|255631004
decrease|260400001|260370003
the duration|103335007
of infectiousness
and
thus
prevent
spread.[3]|410677005

The antibiotic erythromycin|255631004|372694001
or
azithromycin|387531004
is
a front line treatment[7] Newer macrolides|255549009|50009006|276239002|7147002|105908007|255549009|50009006|276239002|7147002|428787002|255549009|50009006|416118004|7147002|105908007|255549009|50009006|416118004|7147002|428787002
are
frequently|70232002
recommended
due to lower rates|261122009
of side effects.

Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole|398731002
may
be
used|394850002
in those with allergies|20401003|421961002|421463005|421961002
to first line agents|255216001|50009006|260872001|232714002|50009006|260872001
or
in infants|418119000
who
have
a risk|30207005
of pyloric stenosis|367403001
from macrolides.|105908007|428787002

Effective treatments|255403003|276239002|254648000|276239002

been
developed.[4]

Erythromycin,|372694001
clarithromycin,|387487009
and
azithromycin|387531004
are
preferred|225773000
for the treatment|276239002|416118004
of pertussis|27836007
in persons ?1 month|125676002|258706009|125676002|259036001

include|55919000
pneumonia,|205237003

Most healthy older children|4757001|102506008|70753007
and
adults|133936004
will
have
a full recovery|261015003
from pertussis,|27836007
however
those
with comorbid conditions|398192003
can
have
a higher risk|15508007
of morbidity
and
mortality.|409651001

Infection
in newborns|133933007
is
particularly severe.|24484000

Pertussis|27836007

Pertussis|27836007
can
cause|23981006|134198009
severe paroxysm-induced cerebral hypoxia|24484000|26593000|16404004|389088001

have
increased|35105006|260366006
substantially
over the past 20 years.[19]|410513005|258707000

Worldwide,
whooping cough|27836007

Before vaccines,|398827000
an average
of 157 cases|398241000|413769002
per 100,000 persons|125676002
were
reported|229059009|223458004
in the U.S.,|223688001
with peaks|255587001
reported|229059009|223458004
every two to five years|420797005|421820001|258707000

more
than 93%
of reported cases|229059009|398241000|229059009|413769002|223458004|398241000|223458004|413769002

in children|410601007|160499008
under 10 years|258707000
of age.|424144002

The actual incidence
was
likely much higher.|2931005|75540009|2931005|371879000

After vaccinations
were
introduced|127487003
in the 1940s,
incidence
fell|1912002
dramatically to less
than 1|260305007
per 100,000
by 1970.

Incidence rates
have
increased|35105006|260366006
somewhat since 1980.

Pertussis|27836007
is
the only vaccine-preventable disease|50607009|398827000|64572001|420295001|398827000|64572001

with increasing deaths|260369004|419620001|260369004|268923008

The number|410680006|410681005

_B.

pertussis_|27836007
was
isolated|46651001
in pure culture|252398009|61594008
in 1906
by Jules Bordet|262415007
and
Octave Gengou,
who also
developed
the first serology|255216001|68793005|232714002|68793005
and

soon
after
_B.

pertussis_|27836007
was
grown
in pure culture|252398009|61594008
in 1906.

In the 1920s,
Dr.|309343006

[Louis W.

Sauer]
(/wiki/Louis_W._Sauer
)
developed
a vaccine|398827000
for whooping cough|27836007
at Evanston Hospital|285201006
(Evanston,
IL|224058004|223609006
).

In 1925,
the Danish physician Thorvald Madsen|309343006
was
the first to|255216001|232714002
test|269814003|272393004
a whole-cell pertussis vaccine|260232004|4421005|396433007|260232004|362837007|396433007
on a wide scale.[27]|90522003|19892000|90522003|278111002

He
used|394850002
the vaccine to|398827000
control|31509003
outbreaks|443684005
in the Faroe Islands|288560006
in the North Sea.|225742004

In 1942,
the American scientist Pearl Kendrick|308027003
combined|89780004
the whole-cell pertussis vaccine|260232004|4421005|396433007|260232004|362837007|396433007
with diphtheria|397428000
and
tetanus toxoids to|58098008
generate
the first DTP combination vaccine.|255216001|421245007|89780004|255216001|125580002|89780004|232714002|421245007|89780004|232714002|125580002|89780004

To
minimize
the frequent side effects|70232002
caused|23981006|134198009
by the pertussis component|27836007|246093002
of the vaccine,|398827000
the Japanese scientist Yuji Sato|414551003|308027003
developed
an acellular pertussis vaccine|396433007
consisting
of purified haemagglutinins
(
HAs
:
filamentous strep throat|43878008
and
leucocytosis-promoting-factor HA|414478003
)
,
which
are
secreted
by _B.

pertussis_|27836007
into the culture medium.|421955000

Sato's acellular pertussis vaccine|396433007
was
used|394850002
in Japan since 1981.|223583001

Later versions|260383002|22303008
of the acellular pertussis vaccine|396433007
used|394850002
in other countries|74964007|223369002
consisted
of additional defined components|260364009|246093002
of _B.

pertussis_|27836007
and
were
often part|70232002|260726005
of the DTaP combination vaccine.|89780004|398827000

The complete _B.|255594003

pertussis_ genome|27836007|18470003
of 4,086,186 base pairs|260308009
was
sequenced|72633008
in 2004.[29]

Much
of the controversy
surrounding|355648006
the DPT vaccine|421245007|125580002
in the 1970s
and
1980s
related|272151006|262094002
to the question|42425007
of
whether
the whole-cell pertussis component|260232004|27836007
caused|23981006|134198009
permanent brain injury|6934004|2470005
in rare cases,|84638005|398241000|84638005|413769002|103356009|398241000|103356009|413769002
called
_pertussis vaccine encephalopathy_.|396433007

Despite this possibility,
doctors|309343006
recommended
the vaccine|398827000
due to the overwhelming public health benefit,|310115006
because
the claimed rate
was
very low|260362008
(one case|421379005|398241000
per 310,000 immunizations,|127785005
or
about 50 cases|398241000|413769002
out of the 15 million
immunizations|127785005
each year|258707000|259039008
in the United States|223688001
)
,
and
the risk|30207005
of death|419620001|268923008
from the disease|64572001
was
high|75540009|371879000
(pertussis killed thousands|27836007|248007002
of Americans
each year|258707000|259039008
before the vaccine|398827000
was
introduced|127487003
).[30]

No studies|110465008|224699009
showed
a causal connection,|134198009|263538003
and
later studies|260383002|110465008|260383002|224699009
showed
no connection|263538003
of any type|261664005
between administration|413454004|416118004
of the DPT vaccine|421245007|125580002
and
permanent brain injury.|6934004|2470005

The alleged vaccine-induced brain damage|398827000|16404004|2470005
proved|277025001
to
be
an unrelated condition,|262241003|260905004
infantile epilepsy.|3658006|313307000|263784005|313307000

Eventually evidence|18669006
against the hypothesized existence
of pertussis vaccine encephalopathy|396433007
mounted|246143003
to the point
that
in 1990,
the _Journal
of American Medical Association_ called|74188005|263534001|74188005|272151006
it a "myth"
and
"nonsense".[32]

However,
before
that point,
criticism
of the studies|110465008|224699009
showing
no connection|263538003
and
a few well-publicized anecdotal reports|57176003|20572008|229059009|57176003|20572008|223458004
of permanent disability|6934004|21134002
that
were
blamed
on the DPT vaccine|421245007|125580002
gave|419582001
rise
to anti-DPT movements|255324009
in the 1970s.

The negative publicity|260385009
and
fear-mongering|1402001
caused|23981006|134198009
the immunization rate to|127785005
fall|1912002
in several countries,|261028005|223369002
including|55919000
Great Britain,|223861009
Sweden,|223681007
and
Japan.|223583001

In many cases,|398241000|413769002
a dramatic increase|260366006
in the incidence
of pertussis|27836007
followed.[34]|367409002

Unscientific claims
about the vaccine pushed suppliers|398827000|303365000|398827000|420620005
of the vaccines|398827000
out of the market.|284440009

In the United States,|223688001
low profit margins|62482003|112233002|62482003|82868003|62482003|372249001|371880002|112233002|371880002|82868003|371880002|372249001
and
an increase|260366006
in vaccine-related lawsuits|398827000|272151006|398827000|262094002
led|88488004|236874000
many manufacturers to
stop|422117008
producing
the DPT vaccine|421245007|125580002
by the early 1980s.[30]|264499004

In 1982,
the television documentary "DPT|255712000
:
Vaccine Roulette"|398827000
depicted
the lives|224130005
of children|410601007|160499008
whose severe disabilities|24484000|21134002
were
inaccurately
blamed
on the DPT vaccine|421245007|125580002
by reporter Lea Thompson.|51764002

The negative publicity|260385009
generated
by the documentary
led|88488004|236874000
to a tremendous increase|260366006
in the number|410680006|410681005
of lawsuits
filed|12953007
against vaccine manufacturers.|398827000

By 1985,
manufacturers
of vaccines|398827000
had
difficulty obtaining liability insurance.|371157007|398092000

The price
of the DPT vaccine skyrocketed,|421245007|125580002
leading|236874000
to shortages
around the country.|223369002

Only one manufacturer|50607009|421379005|420295001|421379005
of the DPT vaccine|421245007|125580002
remained
in the U.S.|223688001

by the end|261782000|422117008
of 1985.

To
avert
a vaccine crisis,|398827000|32937002
Congress
in 1986
passed
the National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act (NCVIA)|68433009|398827000
,
which
established|263748003|385645004
a federal
no-fault system to|241775008|246333005
compensate|17275008
victims
of injury
caused|23981006|134198009
by mandated vaccines.|398827000

The majority
of claims
that
have
been
filed|12953007
through the NCVIA
have
been
related|272151006|262094002
to injuries allegedly
caused|23981006|134198009
by the whole-cell DPT vaccine.|260232004|4421005|421245007|260232004|4421005|125580002|260232004|362837007|421245007|260232004|362837007|125580002

The concerns
about side effects
led|88488004|236874000
Yuji Sato to
introduce|127487003
an even safer acellular version|22303008
of the pertussis vaccine|396433007
for Japan|223583001
in 1981.

The acellular pertussis vaccine|396433007
was
approved|9571008
in the United States|223688001
in 1992
for use|277889008|419385000
in the combination DTaP vaccine.|89780004|398827000

Research
has
shown
the acellular vaccine to|398827000
be
safer,
with fewer reports|57176003|229059009|57176003|223458004
of adverse effects.[38]|264670000

In April
and
May 2012,
pertussis|27836007
was
declared
to
be
at epidemic levels|258395000
in the state|398070004
of Washington,|421908005
USA.|223688001

In September 2012,
a similar epidemic
of pertussis|27836007
was
seen
in parts|260726005
of the United Kingdom,|223860005
with several babies|261028005|418119000
dying|399069006
as a result.|394617004

[39][40]|259031006
The state|398070004
of Wisconsin|427726005
has
the highest incidence rate,|75540009|371879000
however
it
has
not
released|68776005|129299003
an official epidemic declaration.
