*Lipodystrophy|71325002
*
*
is
a medical condition|74188005|260905004
characterized
by abnormal|263654008
or
degenerative conditions|33359002|260905004
of the body's adipose tissue.|279495008|38888009|123037004|38888009

("Lipo"
is
Greek|1451003
for "fat"|271590003
and
"dystrophy"|4720007
is
Greek|1451003
for "abnormal|263654008
or
degenerative condition".|33359002|260905004
)
A more specific term,|242762006|69658003
lipoatrophy|71325002|248315005
is
used|394850002
when
describing
the loss
of fat|271590003
from one area|421379005|42798000
(usually
the face|89545001|302549007
).

This condition|260905004
is
also
characterized
by a lack|41277001
of circulating leptin|65929005|414601001|65929005|117694008
which
may
lead|88488004
to osteosclerosis.|49347007

Lipodystrophy|71325002
is
be
divided|422033008
into the following types|255260001|261664005
:
[1]|260305007
:
495-7

A lipodystrophy|71325002
can
be
a lump|300848003
or
small dent|255507004
in the skin|119325001|39937001|181469002
that forms|246176004
when
a person|125676002
keeps
performing injections|28289002|129326001
in the same spot.|262126009|23840004

These types|261664005
of lipodystrophies|71325002
are
harmless.

People|125676002
who
want|410526009
to
avoid
them
can
do
so|223528007
by changing|243326001|263703002
(rotating|263861005
)
the places|257557008
where they
perform|398166005
injections.|28289002|129326001

For people|125676002
with diabetes,|73211009
using|260676000
purified insulins|412222002
may
also
help.

One|421379005
of the side-effects
of lipodystrophy|71325002
is
the rejection
of the injected medication,|410942007
the slowing|419443000
down
of the absorption
of the medication,|410942007
or
trauma
that
can
cause|23981006|134198009
bleeding|131148009
that,
in turn,|282987006
will
reject
the medication.|410942007

In any
of these scenarios,
the dosage|277406006
of the medication,|410942007
such as insulin|412222002
for diabetics,
becomes
impossible to
gauge|277245004
correctly
and
the treatment|276239002|416118004
of the disease|64572001
for which
the medication|410942007
is
administered|418283001
is
impaired thereby|260379002|40226000
allowing
the medical condition|74188005|260905004
to worsen.|230993007|390772001

In some cases,|398241000|413769002
rotation|70433009
of the injection sites|268517006
may
not
be
enough to
prevent
lipodystrophy.|71325002

Lipodystrophies|71325002
can
be
a possible side effect|371930009|60022001
of antiretroviral drugs.|410942007

Other lipodystrophies|74964007|71325002
manifest|250255003
as lipid redistribution|70106000|18565007
;
with excess,|260378005
or
lack|41277001
of,
fat|271590003
in various regions|256220008|410673009
of the body.|279495008|123037004

These
include|55919000
,
but
are
not
limited|255469002
to,
having
sunken cheeks|60819002
and/or
"
humps
"
on the back|123961009|255551008|281213008|302552004|77568009
or
back of the neck|45048000|302550007
(also
referred|439980006
to
as
buffalo hump|10867005
)
[2]|260306008
which also
exhibits
due to excess cortisol.|260378005|396458002

Lipodystrophy|71325002
can
be
caused|23981006|134198009
by metabolic abnormalities|276654001
due to genetic issues.|3950001|55607006|255395001|55607006

These
are
often|70232002
characterized
by insulin resistance|48606007
and
are
associated|47429007
with Metabolic Syndrome.|237602007
