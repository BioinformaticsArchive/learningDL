*Familial Mediterranean fever** (FMF)|12579009
is
a hereditary inflammatory disorder[1]|32895009|255404009|128139000
:
149.

FMF|12579009
is
an autoinflammatory disease|64572001
caused|23981006|134198009
by mutations|55446002
in MEFV,
a gene|67271001
which
encodes
a 781?amino acid protein|52518006|88878007
denoted
pyrin.[2]

The disorder|64572001
has
been
given various names|408677003|256220008
including|55919000
familial paroxysmal polyserositis,|12579009
periodic peritonitis,|12579009
recurrent polyserositis,|12579009
benign paroxysmal peritonitis,|12579009
periodic disease|12579009
or
periodic fever,|81591007|386661006
Reimann periodic disease|12579009
or
Reimann's syndrome,|11888009
Siegal-Cattan-Mamou disease,|12579009
and
Wolff periodic disease.|12579009

Note
that "periodic fever"|81591007|386661006
can
also
refer|439980006
to any
of the Periodic fever syndromes.|307421005|386661006

FMF|12579009
affects|4065008
groups|261586004|160481000
of people|125676002
originating
from
around the Mediterranean Sea|225742004
(hence
its name
).

It
is
prominently
present|52101004|246105001
in the Armenian people,|297466003|125676002|113169009|125676002
Sephardi Jews|51616000|160543007
(
and
,
to a much lesser extent,|242762006|263796003|255590007|4757001|263796003|255590007
Ashkenazi Jews|81706006
)
,
Cypriots,
Turks|44460002
and
Arabs.[6]|90027003

There
are
seven types|420359007|261664005
of attacks.|216299002

Ninety percent|118582008
of all patients|116154003
have
their first attacks|255216001|216299002|232714002|216299002
before
they
are
18 years old.|258707000|70753007

All
develop
over 2?4 hours|123030002
and
last
anywhere
from 6 hours|123033000
to 4 days.|260308009|258703001

Most attacks|216299002
involve|248448006
fever.[6]|386661006

AA-amyloidosis|281034005
with renal failure|42399005
is
a complication|116223007|263718001
and
may
develop
without overt crises.|32937002

AA amyloid protein|40185008|184196007|259778002
is
produced
in very large quantities|258262008|107651007
during attacks,|216299002
and
at a low rate|62482003|371880002
between them,
and
accumulates
mainly
in the kidney,|64033007|17373004|181414000
as well as
the heart,|80891009|302509004
spleen,|78961009|181279003
gastrointestinal tract|122865005|279972009
and
thyroid.[6]|69748006|61020000

There
appears
to
be
an increase|260366006
in the risk|30207005
for developing particular vasculitis-related diseases|31996006|272151006|64572001|31996006|262094002|64572001
(e.g.|258795003

Henoch-Sch?nlein purpura,|191306005|403967000
spondylarthropathy,|372109003
prolonged arthritis|255224006|3723001
of certain joints|17162000|39352004|17162000|81087007
and
protracted myalgia.[6]|68962001

The diagnosis|439401001
is
clinically
made
on the basis|418836005
of the history|392521001
of typical attacks,|216299002
especially
in patients|116154003
from the ethnic groups|397731000
in which FMF|12579009
is
more highly prevalent.|242762006|75540009

An acute phase response|255251009
is
present|52101004|246105001
during attacks,|216299002
with high C-reactive protein levels,|75540009|55235003|371879000|55235003
an elevated white blood cell count|75540009|767002|75540009|365630000
and
other markers|74964007
of inflammation.|257552002

In patients|116154003
with a long history|255511005|255511005|392521001
of attacks,|216299002
monitoring|302805002
the renal function|11953005
is
of importance
in predicting chronic renal failure.[6]|46177005

A genetic test|405824009
is
also available to|103328004
detect|260373001
mutations|55446002
in the _MEFV_ gene.|67271001

Sequencing
of exons 2,|33091005
3,
5,
and
10
of this gene|67271001
detects|260373001
an estimated 97%|414135002|260309001|414135002|264708004
of all known mutations.[6]|36692007|55446002

A specific|69658003
and
highly sensitive test|255383001|269814003|255383001|255383001|272393004
for FMF|12579009
is
the "Metaraminol Provocative Test (MPT),|372728001|52424002
"
whereby a single 10 mg infusion|125681006|427264006|447826007|50607009|427264006|447826007
of Metaraminol|372728001
is
administered|418283001
to the patient.|116154003

A positive diagnosis|258758003|439401001|258758003|10828004|439401001|10828004
is
made
if
the patient|116154003
presents|52101004|246105001
with a typical,
albeit
milder,|255604002
FMF attack|12579009|217315002|12579009|216299002
within 48 hours.|255249005

As MPT
is
more sensitive|242762006|83185005
than specific,|69658003
it
does
not
identify|7882003
all cases|398241000|413769002
of FMF.|12579009

Although
a positive MPT|258758003|10828004
can
be
very useful.[7][8]|260358002

Virtually
all cases|398241000|413769002
are
due to a mutation|55446002
in the _MEFV_ gene|67271001
on the sixteenth chromosome,|91272006
which
codes
for a protein|88878007
called
_pyrin_
or
_marenostrin_.

Various mutations|256220008|55446002
of this gene|67271001
lead|88488004
to FMF,|12579009
although
some mutations|55446002
cause|23981006|134198009
a more severe picture|242762006|24484000|257444003|242762006|24484000|257445002
than others.|74964007

Mutations|55446002
occur|272120004
mainly
in exons 2,|33091005
3,
5
and
10.[6]|258731005

The function|246464006
of pyrin
has
not
been
completely
elucidated
,
but
it
appears
to
be
a suppressor
of the activation
of caspase 1,|130666007
the enzyme|90668006
that
stimulates
production
of interleukin 1?,|116722001|50762005
a cytokine|75777003
central|26216008
to the process|415178003
of inflammation.|257552002

In other words|74964007|255373000
an ineffective pyrin
doesn't
inhibit|61511001
inflammation normally,|257552002
resulting|42752001
in inflammatory episodes|272128006
of membranes|83097008
at differing sites.|10546003

It
is
not conclusively
known|36692007
what exactly
sets
off the attacks,|216299002
and
why overproduction
of IL-1|50762005
would
lead|88488004
to particular symptoms
in particular organs|410653004
(e.g.|258795003

joints|39352004|81087007
or
the peritoneal cavity|181616008|83670000
).[6]

The _MEFV_ gene|67271001
is
located
on the short arm|249739008
of chromosome 16|39220001
(16p13
).

The disorder inherits|64572001|255404009
in an autosomal recessive fashion.|258211005

Therefore,
two asymptomatic carrier parents|420797005|84387000|47461006|40683002|420797005|84387000|29679002|40683002
have
a 25% chance
of a child|410601007|160499008
with the disorder,|64572001
a 50% chance
of a child|410601007|160499008
who
is
an asymptomatic carrier|84387000|47461006|84387000|29679002
and
a 25% chance
of a child|410601007|160499008
who
does
not
carry|288345009
the disorder.|64572001

FMF patients|12579009|116154003
who
have
children|410601007|160499008
with a carrier|47461006|29679002
or
another FMF patient|12579009|116154003
have
a 50%
and
100% chance,
respectively,
of
having
a child|410601007|160499008
with FMF.[9][10]|12579009

There
is
one known case|421379005|36692007|398241000
of an affected patient|103309006
with only one parent|50607009|421379005|40683002|420295001|421379005|40683002
who
is
a carrier.|47461006|29679002

This
is
caused|23981006|134198009
by a unique mutation|55446002
on the sixteenth chromosome.|91272006

Attacks|216299002
are
self-limiting,|255469002
and
require
analgesia|278414003|38433004
and
NSAIDs|372665008
(
such as diclofenac.[6]|7034005

Colchicine,|387413002
a drug otherwise mainly|410942007
used|394850002
in gout,|90560007
decreases|260370003
attack|217315002|216299002
frequency|260864003|272123002
in FMF patients.|12579009|116154003

The exact way
in which colchicine|387413002
suppresses|245780008
attacks|216299002
is
unclear.

While
this agent|260872001
is
not
without side effects
(
such as abdominal pain|21522001
and
muscle pains,|68962001
it
may
markedly|46998006
improve|385425000|3442003|385633008
quality|263496004
of life|224130005
in patients.|116154003

The dosage|277406006
is
typically 1?2 mg|427264006
a day.|258703001|259032004

Development|278923009
of amyloidosis|17602002
is
delayed
with colchicine treatment.|387413002|276239002|387413002|416118004

Interferon|49327004
is
being
studied|110465008|224699009
as a therapeutic modality.|262202000

Some advise discontinuation|424900004|278308006|424900004|410546004
of colchicine|387413002
before
and
during pregnancy,|289908002
but
the data
are
inconsistent,|260380004
and
others|74964007
feel|285854004
it
is
safe to
take|419652001
colchicine|387413002
during pregnancy.[11]|289908002

Approximately 5?10%|26175008
of FMF cases|12579009|398241000|12579009|413769002
are
resistant|30714006
to colchicine therapy|387413002|276239002
alone.|105529008

In these cases,|398241000|413769002
adding
anakinra|385549000
to the daily colchicine regimen|69620002|387413002
has
been
successful.[12]|385669000

A New York allergist,|420278009|63098009
Dr Sheppard Siegal,|309343006
first
described
the attacks|216299002
of peritonitis|48661000
in 1945
;
he
termed
this "benign paroxysmal peritonitis",|12579009
as
the disease course|246453008
was
essentially benign.|30807003

Dr Hobart Reimann,|309343006
working|261041009
in the American University|224871002
in Beirut,
described
a more|242762006
complete|255594003
picture|257444003|257445002
which he
termed "periodic disease".[14][15]|12579009

In 1972,
colchicine|387413002
was
discovered
to
prevent
attacks.[16]|216299002

The link
to the _MEFV_ gene|67271001
was
discovered
in 1997
by two different groups,|420797005|263735002|261586004|420797005|263735002|160481000
each
working|261041009
independently -
the French FMF Consortium,|19434008|12579009
[9]
and
the International FMF Consortium.[10]|12579009
