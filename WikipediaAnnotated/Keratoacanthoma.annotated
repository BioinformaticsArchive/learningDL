*
*Keratoacanthoma** (KA)|254662007
is
a common low-grade|72906007
(unlikely to
metastasize
or
invade
)
skin tumour|126488004
that
is
believed to
originate
from the neck|45048000|302550007
of the hair follicle.|67290009|280830006

Many pathologists|260396001|61207006
consider
it to
be
a form|246176004
of squamous cell carcinoma (SCC).|402815007

The pathologist often|61207006|70232002
labels
KA
as "well-differentiated squamous cell carcinoma,|263933003|402815007
keratoacanthoma variant",|254662007|40885006
because
about 6%
of KA
manifest|250255003
itself
as
squamous cell carcinoma|402815007
when
left|7771000
untreated.|25265005

KA
is
commonly
found|404684003
on sun-exposed skin,|49926000|24932003|119325001|49926000|24932003|39937001|49926000|24932003|181469002
and
often|70232002
is
seen
on the face,|89545001|302549007
forearms|14975008
and
hands.[4]|85562004

The defining characteristic
of KA
is
that
it
is
dome-shaped, symmetrical,|60563001|18772005
surrounded|355648006
by a smooth wall|82280004|224727009
of inflamed skin,|119325001|39937001|181469002
and
capped|228254002
with keratin scales|259987000|19892000|259987000|13389002|102665003|19892000|102665003|13389002
and
debris.|257159000

It always
grows
rapidly,|418694008
reaching|282679008
a large size|255509001|277049003
within days|258703001
or
weeks,|258705008
and
if untreated|25265005
will
starve
itself
of nourishment,
necrose|6574001
(
die|419620001|399069006|419099009
)
,
slough,|44015005
and
heal|298005009
with scarring.|275322007

While
some pathologists|61207006
classify|73504009
KA
as a distinct tumor|108369006
and
not
a malignancy,|363346000|372087000
enough clinical|58147004
and
histological KA|67151002
do
progress|385651009
to invasive|10179008
and
aggressive squamous cell cancers,|61372001|402815007|402815007
therefore
prompt
and
aggressive treatment|61372001|276239002|61372001|416118004|276239002|416118004
is
required.[5][6]

In reality,
the defining characteristics
of a KA
can
not
be
found|404684003
when
only
a small fragment|255507004|29140007
of a large KA|255509001
is
submitted
for pathology review.|394595002

If
the keratin debris|29463007
is
submitted,
no diagnosis|439401001
can
be
made.

If
a deep core|131197000|260235002
or
peripheral deep wedge|14414005|131197000|255296002
is
performed,|398166005
a squamous cell carcinoma|402815007
is
often|70232002
noted.

Only
when
almost
the entire structure|255503000|260232004
is
submitted,
can
a true diagnosis|31874001|439401001|31874001
of a KA
be
made.

This further|46053002
complicates|255302009
the distinction
between a clinical diagnosis|39154008
of a KA
and
the pathologic diagnosis|88101002
of a KA
vs
a squamous cell cancer.|402815007

Keratoacanthomas|254662007
(molluscum sebaceum|254662007
)
may
be
divided|422033008
into the following types|255260001|261664005
:
[7]
:
763-764[8]
:
643-646

The tumors usually|108369006
occur|272120004
in older individuals|70753007|125676002|70753007|385435006
(mean age 64 years old|255586005|424144002|258707000|70753007
).

Like squamous cell cancer,|402815007
data
suggests
ultraviolet light|41355003
from the sun|49926000
causes|134198009
the development|278923009
of KA.

Just
like its close relative,|29179001|125677006|29179001|29920004
the squamous cell cancer,|402815007
sporadic cases|75741005|398241000|75741005|413769002
have
been
found|404684003
co-infected
with the human papilloma virus (HPV).[10]|9482002

Diagnosis|439401001
is
best|20572008|3442003
done
with clinical exam|58147004|225886003
and
history.|392521001

It
presents|52101004|246105001
as a fleshy,
elevated|75540009
and
nodular lesion|255288007
with an irregular crater shape|49608001|107644003|49608001|246176004|49608001|300842002
and
a characteristic central hyperkeratotic core.|29144003|255424008

Usually
the patient|116154003
will
notice
a rapidly|418694008
growing
dome-shaped tumor|60563001|108369006
on sun-exposed skin.|49926000|24932003|119325001|49926000|24932003|39937001|49926000|24932003|181469002

A skin biopsy|240977001
must
be
performed|398166005
to
confirm|59156000
the diagnosis.|439401001

Unfortunately,
a shave biopsy|72342005
will
often|70232002
reveal|263857004
only keratin fragments.|50607009|259987000|29140007|50607009|102665003|29140007|420295001|259987000|29140007|420295001|102665003|29140007

A deep punch biopsy|131197000|68660007|131197000|87697008
will
often|70232002
reveal|263857004
a well|20572008
differentiated,|263933003
mildly atypical, squamous cell|255604002|112231000|80554009
suggestive|7196007
of an actinic keratosis|201101007
or
a squamous cell carcinoma.|402815007

Only
when
the pathologist|61207006
has
access|260507000
to the entire lesion|255503000|260232004
(
not practical
in many circumstances
)
can
a correct diagnosis|439401001
be
made.

From a practical standpoint
(insurance reimbursement
)
,
the correct diagnosis|439401001
should
be
"well|20572008
differentiated squamous cell carcinoma,|263933003|402815007
keratoacanthoma variant".|254662007|40885006

This
is
especially important
for facial|89545001
and
nasal KA's,|260540009
as
it
allows
the surgeon to|304292004
treat|395077000
the tumor|108369006
with the proper respect
it
deserves
,
with margin-controlled surgery|112233002|31509003|83578000|82868003|31509003|83578000|372249001|31509003|83578000
like Mohs surgery.|418024000

Correct diagnosis often|439401001|70232002|70232002
requires
communication|263536004
between the surgeon|304292004
and
the pathologist.|61207006

Many pathologists|260396001|61207006
are
still
under the impression|286781002
that keratoacanthomas|254662007
are
benign growths|30807003
that
do
not
require
surgery.|83578000

Unfortunately,
when
the lesion
appears
on the nose,|260540009|181195007
face,|89545001|302549007
or
hands|85562004
it often|70232002
grows
to marble
or
golf ball size|44845007|277049003
before necrosing,|6574001
and
leaving|7771000|90737002
a sizable crater|277049003
in the process.|415178003

From a practical standpoint,
the correct diagnosis|439401001
of low grade squamous cell carcinoma|402815007
should
be
rendered
after communication|263536004
between the surgeon|304292004
and
pathologist,|61207006
as
the tumor|108369006
is
often much more aggressive|70232002|61372001|70232002
and
the morbidity
is
much higher|242762006|75540009|242762006|371879000|4757001|75540009|4757001|371879000
than the relatively benign basal cell carcinoma.|30807003|275265005

On the trunk,|22943007|262225004
arms,|40983000
and
legs,|30021000
electrodesiccation|8401003
and
curettage often suffice.|129319001|70232002

Excision|118292001|128303001
of the entire lesion|255503000|260232004
is
often|70232002
required
if one wants to|421379005|410526009
confirm|59156000
the clinical diagnosis|39154008
of keratoacanthoma.|254662007

On the nose|260540009|181195007
and
face,|89545001|302549007
Mohs surgery|418024000
allows
for good margin control|20572008|112233002|31509003|20572008|82868003|31509003|20572008|372249001|31509003
with minimal tissue removal|255605001|85756007|118292001|255605001|85756007|128303001|255604002|85756007|118292001|255604002|85756007|128303001
;
unfortunately,
many insurance companies
require
the correct diagnosis|439401001
of a malignancy|363346000|372087000
before allowing
such procedure.|71388002

Recurrence|246455001
after electrodesiccation|8401003
and
curettage|129319001
is
common,|72906007
and
usually
can
be
identified|7882003
and
treated|28995006
promptly
with
either
further curettage|46053002|129319001
or
surgical excision.|128303001

Allowing
the KA to
grow
and
necrose|6574001
spontaneously
is
not acceptable
in today's standard
of care.
