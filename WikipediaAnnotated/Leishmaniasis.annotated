*Leishmaniasis|80612004
*
*
is
a disease|64572001
caused|23981006|134198009
by protozoan parasites|46770001
that
belong
to the genus _Leishmania_|79357004
and
is
transmitted|60117003|258150004
by the bite|3404009|25272006
of certain species|17162000|69658003
of sand fly|38152001
(subfamily Phlebotominae.

Although
the majority
of the literature mentions only one genus|421379005|18511007
transmitting|60117003
_Leishmania_|79357004
to humans|278412004
(_Lutzomyia_|20755003
)
in America,
a 2003 study|110465008|224699009
by Galati
suggested
a new classification|7147002|73504009
for American sand flies,|38152001
elevating|75540009
several subgenera|261028005
to the genus level.|18511007|258395000|18511007|276625007

Elsewhere
in the world,
the genus _Phlebotomus_|38152001
is
considered
the vector|260529001
of leishmaniasis.[1]|80612004

Most
forms|246176004
of the disease|64572001
are
transmissible only
from animals|387961004
(zoonosis,|28762008
but
some
can
be
spread|410677005
between humans.|278412004

Human infection|278412004
is
caused|23981006|134198009
by about 21
of 30 species|69658003
that
infect
mammals_[citation|387976007
needed|410525008|103325001
_]
:
the different species|263735002|69658003
are
morphologically indistinguishable,
but
they
can
be
differentiated|263933003
by isoenzyme analysis,|272389005|30375003|272389005
DNA sequence analysis,|62302004|72633008
or
monoclonal antibodies.|49616005

Cutaneous leishmaniasis|240637006
is
the most common form|4757001|72906007|246176004
of leishmaniasis.|80612004

Visceral leishmaniasis|186803007
is
a severe form|24484000|246176004
in which
the parasites|37763007
migrate
to the vital organs.|260410005|410653004

The symptoms
of leishmaniasis|80612004
are
skin sores|46742003
which
erupt
weeks|258705008
to months|258706009
after the person|125676002
affected|247591002|248448006
is
bitten|3404009|25272006
by sand flies.|38152001

Other consequences,|74964007|103332005
which
can
manifest|250255003
anywhere
from a few months|57176003|258706009
to years|258707000
after infection,
include|55919000
fever,|386661006
damage|37782003
to the spleen|78961009|181279003
and
liver,|10200004|181268008
and
anemia.|271737000

In clinical medicine,|58147004|410942007
leishmaniasis|80612004
is
considered one|421379005
of the classic causes|255301002|134198009|255333006|134198009
of a markedly|46998006
enlarged|260376009|118452000
(
and
therefore palpable|103357000
)
spleen|78961009|181279003
;
the organ,|410653004
which
is
not normally
felt|285854004
during examination|5880005
of the abdomen,|277112006|52731004|302553009
may
become
larger even|255509001|263768009
than the liver|10200004|181268008
in severe cases.|24484000|398241000|24484000|413769002

Leishmaniasis|80612004
may
be
divided|422033008
into the following types|255260001|261664005
:

Leishmaniasis|80612004
is
transmitted|60117003|258150004
by the bite|3404009|25272006
of female phlebotomine sandflies.|248152002|38152001|224526002|38152001

The sandflies|38152001
inject|422145002
the infective stage,|21191007|371508000|261612004
metacyclic promastigotes,|103548005
during blood meals|87612001|119273009

Metacyclic promastigotes|103548005
that
reach|282679008
the puncture wound|11639007
are
phagocytized
by macrophages|58986001
*
*
(2
)
*
*
and
transform
into amastigotes|103547000

*
*.

Amastigotes|103547000
multiply|421206002
in infected cells|4421005
and
affect|4065008
different tissues,|263735002|85756007

in part|260726005
on which _Leishmania_ species|419793002
is
involved|248448006

*.

These differing tissue specificities|85756007|69658003
cause|23981006|134198009
the differing clinical manifestations|58147004|250255003|58147004|251190009
of the various forms|256220008|246176004
of leishmaniasis.|80612004

Sandflies|38152001
become
infected
during blood meals|87612001|119273009
on infected hosts
when
they

Leishmaniasis|80612004
is
caused|23981006|134198009
by infection
with the pathogen _Leishmania_.|264418008|79357004

The genomes|18470003
of three _Leishmania_ species|421291004|419793002
(_L.|258995007|420559008

major_,|255603008
_L.|258995007|420559008

infantum_,
and
_L.|258995007|420559008

braziliensis_
)
have
been
sequenced|72633008
and
this
has
provided
much information
about the biology|12893009
of the parasite.|37763007

For example,
in _Leishmania_,|79357004
protein-coding genes|88878007|67271001
are
understood|66216009
to
be
organized|385650005
as large polycistronic units|255509001|258666001
in a head-to-head|69536005|302548004
or
tail-to-tail manner|13951002
;
RNA polymerase II|116739004
transcribes
long polycistronic messages|255511005
in the absence|2667000|418560003
of defined RNA pol II promoters,|27888000|27888000|223640004
and
_Leishmania_|79357004
has
unique features
with respect
to the regulation
of gene expression|89551006
in response
to changes|243326001|263703002
in the environment.|276339004

The new knowledge|7147002|225795001
from these studies|110465008|224699009
may
help
identify|7882003
new targets|7147002
for urgently needed drugs|410525008|410942007|103325001|410942007
and
aid|246088000
the development|278923009
of vaccines.[1]|398827000

Leishmaniasis|80612004
is
diagnosed|439401001
in the haematology laboratory|261904005|33468001|261904005
by direct visualization|255589003
of the amastigotes|103547000
(Leishman-Donovan bodies|255802001|417443008
).

Buffy-coat preparations|256366000|225106003
of peripheral blood|119273009
or
aspirates|119295008
from marrow,|227250008
spleen,|78961009|181279003
lymph nodes,|59441001
or
skin lesions|95324001
should
be
spread|410677005
on a slide to|258661006
make
a thin smear|18043004
and
stained|397165007|127790008
with Leishman's|255802001
or
Giemsa's stain|373646006|104208006
(pH 7.2|27327002|264723009|264724003|264725002|365723003
)
for 20 minutes.|258701004|255507004|356624006

Amastigotes|103547000
are
seen
with monocytes|55918008|67776007
or
,
less commonly|276139006|263796003
in neutrophils,|116712007
of peripheral blood|119273009
and
in macrophages|58986001
in aspirates.|119295008

They
are
small, round bodies 2?4 ?m|255507004|42700002|279495008|255507004|42700002|123037004
in diameter|81827009
with indistinct cytoplasm,
a nucleus,|84640000
and
a small, rod-shaped kinetoplast.|255507004|17139002|107644003|48929002|255507004|17139002|300842002|48929002

Occasionally,
amastigotes|103547000
may
be
seen
lying|40199007|255576009
free|37837009
between cells.|4421005

However,
the retrieval
of tissue samples|119376003
is
often painful|70232002|22253000
for the patient|116154003
and
it
can
be
difficult to|52925006
identify|7882003
the infected cells.|4421005

For these reasons,|410666004
other indirect immunological methods|272394005|255541007|37523008
of diagnosis|439401001
are
developed.

These methods|260686004|272394005
include|55919000
the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA),|76978006
antigen coated dipsticks,|7120007|228224007|272187004
and
the direct agglutination test (DAT).|258015005|269814003|258015005|258015005|272393004|255589003|359818001

Although
these tests|269814003|272393004
are
readily available,|103328004
they
are
not
the standard diagnostic tests|103693007
due to their insufficient sensitivity and specificity.|71978007|35209006|69658003|71978007|365705006|69658003|423437008|35209006|69658003|423437008|365705006|69658003

Over the years,|258707000
several different Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) assays|261028005|263735002|258066000|58779000|261028005|263735002|258066000|272392009
are
made
into use|277889008|419385000
for the detection
of Leishmania DNA.|79357004|24851008

With the PCR assay,|258066000|58779000|258066000|272392009|103338009|58779000|103338009|272392009
a specific|69658003
and
sensitive diagnostic procedure|83185005|103693007
is
finally possible.|371930009|60022001

Currently,|15240007
no vaccines|398827000
are
in routine use.|50811001|277889008|50811001|419385000

However,
the genomic sequence|18470003|72633008
of _Leishmania_|79357004
has
provided
a rich source|224166006|260753009
of vaccine candidates.|398827000

Genome-based approaches|18470003|18470003|103379005|18470003|418836005|18470003|418836005|103379005
have
been
used|394850002
to
screen|20135006|360156006
for novel vaccine candidates.|7147002|398827000

One study|421379005|110465008|421379005|224699009
screened|20135006|360156006
100 randomly selected genes|67271001
as DNA vaccines|24851008|398827000
against _L.|258995007|420559008

major_ infection|255603008
in mice.|447612001|447482001

Fourteen reproducibly protective, novel vaccine candidates|7147002|398827000
were
identified.|7882003

A separate study|263869007|110465008|263869007|224699009
used|394850002
a two-step procedure to|420797005|398298007|71388002
identify|7882003
T cell antigens.|121042002

Six unique clones|422218008|47308002
were
identified|7882003
:
glutamine synthetase,|12684006
a transitional endoplasmic reticulum ATPase,|33761008|38854003
elongation factor 1gamma,
kinesin K-39,
repetitive protein A2,|88878007
and
a hypothetical conserved protein.|88878007

The 20 antigens|7120007
identified|7882003
in these two studies|420797005|110465008|420797005|224699009
are
being
further|46053002
evaluated
for vaccine development.[4]|398827000|278923009

There
are
two common therapies|420797005|72906007|276239002
containing|42504009
antimony|421045002
(
known|36692007
as pentavalent antimonials
:
meglumine
antimoniate
(Glucantime
)
and
sodium stibogluconate|419379007
(Pentostam
).

It
is
not completely
understood|66216009
how
these drugs|410942007
act
against the parasite|37763007
;
they
may
disrupt
its energy production|248272003
or
trypanothione metabolism.|47722004

Unfortunately,
in many parts|260726005
of the world,
the parasite|37763007
has
become
resistant|30714006
to antimony|421045002
when
treating|28995006
for visceral|263928002
or
mucocutaneous leishmaniasis,|403135004
[5]|264706000|264605009
but
the level|258395000|276625007
of resistance|30714006
varies
according to species.|69658003

Amphotericin|372643008
(AmBisome
)
is
now
the treatment|276239002|416118004
of choice
;[7]
its failure|76797004
in some cases to|398241000|413769002
treat|395077000
visceral leishmaniasis|186803007
(_Leishmania donovani_
)
has
been
reported|229059009|223458004
in Sudan,|223518003
but
this
may
be
related|272151006|262094002
to
host
factors
such as co-infection
with HIV|19030005|86406008|402916007
or
tuberculosis|371569005
rather than
parasite resistance.|37763007|30714006

Hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyl transferase|65889008
(HGPRT|65889008
; EC 2.4.2.8
)
is
a central enzyme|26216008|90668006
in the purine recycling pathway.|45386002

Parasitic protozoa|417396000
(Leishmania donovani
)
cannot
synthesize
purines|45386002
de novo|224046004|223637004
and
utilize
the salvage pathway to|257950002
produce
purine bases.|45386002|45386002|418836005

Thus,
this enzyme|90668006
is
targeted
in drug discovery|410942007
and
development.|278923009

The model
of the monomeric L.

donovani HGPRT|65889008
showed
that
this enzyme|90668006
is
an ?/?
type protein|261664005|88878007
with a PRTase type I folding pattern.|258191002|10942006|272135003

Among all
of the computationally screened compounds,|20135006|62105006|62105006|360156006|62105006
pentamidine,|372699006

3-dinitroadamantane,|260313008
acyclovir|425884003
and
analogs
of acyclovir|425884003
had
higher binding affinities|75540009|257768005|371879000|257768005
than the real substrate
(guanosine monophosphate|15943003
).

Amino acids|52518006
of HGPRT|65889008
that
are
frequently|70232002
involved|248448006
in the binding|257768005
of these compounds|62105006
are

It
is
predicted
that patients|116154003
suffering
from
both
HIV|19030005|86406008|402916007
and
visceral leishmaniasis (VL)|186803007
may
benefit
if
they
are
treated|28995006
with acyclovir|425884003
or
pentamidine|372699006
in conjunction with first-line antileishmanial therapies|255216001|50009006|276239002|232714002|50009006|276239002

Miltefosine
received
approval|9571008
by the Indian regulatory authorities
in 2002
and
in Germany|223637004
in 2004.

In 2005,
it
received
the first approval|255216001|9571008|232714002|9571008
for cutaneous leishmaniasis|240637006
in Colombia.|223717005

Miltefosine
is
also currently|15240007
being
investigated|116698004
as treatment|276239002|416118004
for mucocutaneous leishmaniasis|403135004
caused|23981006|134198009
by _Leishmania braziliensis_
in Colombia,|223717005
[5]|264706000|264605009
and
preliminary results|261420005|394617004
are
very promising.|260358002

It
is
now
registered|229053005
in many countries|223369002
and
is
the first orally administered breakthrough therapy|255216001|260548002|418283001|255298001|276239002|232714002|260548002|418283001|255298001|276239002
for visceral|263928002
and
cutaneous leishmaniasis.|240637006

In October 2006,
it
received orphan drug status|40606008|263490005
from the
US Food and Drug Administration.|255620007|18629005

The drug|410942007
is
generally better|3442003
tolerated
than other drugs.|74964007|410942007

Main side effects|63161005
are
gastrointestinal disturbance|61578001
in the 1?2 days|303183002|258703001
of treatment,|276239002|416118004
which
does
not
affect|4065008
the efficacy.

Because
it
is
available|103328004
as an oral formulation,|260548002
the expense
and
inconvenience
of hospitalisation|394656005
is
avoided,
which
makes
it an attractive alternative.

However,
there
are
problems|55607006
associated|47429007
with the use|277889008|419385000
of miltefosine
that
arise|68727004
from its teratogenicity|58694006
and
pharmacokinetics
:
In a Dutch study|9533000|110465008|9533000|224699009
by Thomas P.C.

Dorlo
in 2008,
miltefosine
was
shown
to
be
much slower|242762006|419443000|4757001|419443000
eliminated
from the body|279495008|123037004
than previously
thought|88952004
and
was
therefore still detectable
in human plasma samples|278412004|119361006
taken|419652001
five months|421820001|258706009
after the end|261782000|422117008
of treatment.|276239002|416118004

The presence|386397008
of subtherapeutic miltefosine concentrations|82742001
in the blood|87612001|119273009
beyond five months|421820001|258706009
after treatment|276239002|416118004
might
contribute
to the selection|50606000
of resistant parasites|30714006|37763007
and
,
moreover,
the measures|246445000|367346004
for preventing|116699007
the teratogenic risks|45986006|30207005|58694006|30207005
of miltefosine
must
be
reconsidered.

This
led|88488004|236874000
to some reluctance
to taking Miltefosine|419652001
by affected populations.|247591002|385436007|248448006|385436007

The antifungal drug,|373219008
fluconazole 200 mg daily,|387174006|427264006|69620002
has
been
shown
to
be
significantly more effective|255403003|254648000
in the treatment|276239002|416118004
of cutaneous leishmaniasis|240637006
compared
to the placebo
in a trial|110465008
done
in Saudi Arabia.|223616007

In another randomized clinical trial|110465008
from Iran,|223607008
fluconazole 400 mg daily|387174006|427264006|69620002
was
shown
to
be
significantly more effective|255403003|254648000
than fluconazole 200 mg daily|387174006|427264006|69620002
in the treatment|276239002|416118004
of cutaneous leishmaniasis.[13]|240637006

The Institute|385437003
for OneWorld Health|263775005
has
reintroduced
the drug paromomycin|410942007|38044001
for treatment|276239002|416118004
of leishmaniasis,|80612004
results|394617004
with which
led|88488004|236874000
to its approval|9571008
as an orphan drug.|40606008

The Drugs|410942007
for Neglected Diseases Initiative|95930005|64572001|247756008
is
also actively
facilitating
the search
for novel therapeutics.|7147002|262202000

A treatment|276239002|416118004
with paromomycin|38044001
will
cost
about $10.

The drug|410942007
had
originally
been
identified|7882003
in 1960s,
but
had
been
abandoned|385657008
because
it
would
not
be
profitable,
as
the disease mostly|64572001
affects|4065008
poor people.|11403006|125676002|255351007|125676002

The Indian government
approved|9571008
paromomycin|38044001
for sale
in August 2006.

A 21-day course|258703001|288524001|259032004|288524001
of paromomycin|38044001
produces
a definitive cure|261002007
in
>90%|264705001|264703008
of patients|116154003
with visceral leishmaniasis.[16]|186803007

Drug-resistant leishmaniasis|410942007|30714006|80612004
may
respond
to immunotherapy|76334006
(inoculation
with parasite antigens|37763007|7120007
plus an adjuvant,|427067006
which
aims
to
stimulate
the body's|279495008|123037004
own
immune system to|116003000
kill|248007002
the parasite.[17]|37763007

with 0.1% cantharidin ointment|437975006|385101003

Leishmaniasis|80612004
can
be
transmitted|60117003|258150004
in many tropical
and
subtropical countries,|223369002
and
is
found|404684003
in parts|260726005
of about 88 countries.|223369002

Approximately 350 million people|26175008|125676002
live|419749002
in these areas.|42798000

The settings
in which leishmaniasis|80612004
is
found range|404684003
from rainforests
in Central|26216008
and
South America|223504005
to deserts|284565008
in West Asia|223500001
and
the Middle East.|223605000

It
affects|4065008
as many|260396001
as 12 million people worldwide,|125676002
with 1.5?2 million new cases|264623001|7147002|398241000|264623001|7147002|413769002

The visceral form|263928002|246176004
of leishmaniasis|80612004
has
an estimated incidence|414135002
of 500,000 new cases|7147002|398241000|7147002|413769002
and
60,000 deaths|419620001|268923008
each year.|258707000|259039008

More
than 90 percent|264705001|118582008|264703008|118582008
of the world's cases|398241000|413769002

Leishmaniasis|80612004
is
found|404684003
through much|242762006|4757001
of the Americas
from northern Argentina|223713009
to southern Texas,|421662006

Leishmaniasis|80612004
is
also
known|36692007
as
_papalomoyo_,
_papa lo moyo_
and
_ulcero
de los chicleros_
in Latin America.

During 2004,
an estimated 3,400 troops|414135002
from the Colombian army,
operating
in the jungles
near the south
of the country|223369002
(
in particular
around the Meta
and
Guaviare departments
)
,
were
infected
with leishmaniasis.|80612004

Apparently,
a contributing factor
was
that many|260396001
of the affected soldiers|247591002|248448006
did
not
use|277889008|419385000
the officially provided insect repellent,|75627006
because of its allegedly
disturbing
odor.|103371008

Nearly 13,000 cases|398241000|413769002
of the disease|64572001
were
recorded
in all
of Colombia|223717005
throughout 2004,
and
about 360 new instances|7147002

in the Middle East.|223605000

Within Afghanistan,|223597009
leishmaniasis|80612004
occurs|272120004
commonly
in Kabul,
partly
due to bad sanitation|556001
and
waste
left|7771000

in streets,|257710009
allowing
parasite-|37763007
spreading|410677005
sand flies|38152001
an environment|276339004
they
find
favorable.

In Kabul,
the number|410680006|410681005
of people|125676002
infected
was
estimated|414135002
to
be
at least 200,000,|276139006|263796003

Descriptions
of conspicuous lesions
similar
to cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL)|240637006
has
been
discovered
on tablets|385055001|428673006

gave|419582001
detailed descriptions
of what
was
called
_Balkh_ sore.|247348008|279074008|410713007

In 1756,
Alexander Russell,
after
examining|64049009
a Turkish patient,|116154003
gave|419582001
one|421379005
of the most detailed clinical descriptions|4757001|58147004

Physicians|309343006
in the Indian subcontinent|223506007
would
describe
it
as
_kala-azar_|186803007

pronounced
_k?l? ?z?r_,
the Urdu,
Hindi

the parasite's relation to|37763007|125677006
host
tissues|85756007
and
correctly
referred|439980006
it
to Protozoa.|417396000

However,
because
his results|394617004
were
published
in Russian|297514005|85163001
in a journal|433497004
with low circulation,|62482003|413854007|371880002|413854007
his priority|260870009
was
not internationally
acknowledged
during his lifetime.

In 1901,
Leishman|255802001
identified|7882003
certain organisms|17162000|410653004
in smears
taken|419652001
from the spleen|78961009|181279003
of a patient|116154003
who
had
died|419620001|419099009
from "dum-dum fever"|186803007
(_dum dum_
is
an area|42798000
close|29179001
to Calcutta
and
proposed
them to
be
trypanosomes,|40740003
found|404684003
for the first time|255216001|410669006|232714002|410669006
in India.|223600005

A few months later,|57176003|258706009
Captain Charles Donovan
(1863?1951
)
confirmed|59156000
the finding|404684003
of what
became
known|36692007
as Leishman-Donovan bodies|255802001|417443008
in smears
taken|419652001
from patients|116154003
in Madras,
India.|223600005

But
it
was
Ronald Ross
who
proposed
that Leishman-Donovan bodies|255802001|417443008
were
the intracellular stages|83167003|261612004
of a new parasite,|7147002|37763007
which
he
named _Leishmania donovani_.|27468005

The link
with the disease _kala-azar_|64572001|186803007
was
first|255216001|232714002
suggested
by Charles Donovan,
but
was
conclusively
demonstrated
by Charles Bentley's discovery
of _Leishmania donovani_
in patients|116154003
with _kala-azar_.|186803007

The disease|64572001
was
a major problem|255603008|55607006
for Allied troops
fighting|248005005
in Sicily
during the Second World War|81170007|257997001|288495006
;
research
by Leonard Goodwin then
showed
pentostam
was
an effective treatment.[43]|255403003|276239002|255403003|416118004|254648000|276239002|254648000|416118004

Several potential vaccines|261028005|30207005|398827000
are
being
developed,
under pressure|261089000|279046003|261089000|13543005|261089000|257893003
from the World Health Organization,|263775005|21139007
but
as of 2010[[update]]
(//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title|419205000
=Leishmaniasis&action|80612004|129264002

none|260413007
are
available.|103328004

The team
at the Laboratory|261904005
for Organic Chemistry|41175001
at the Swiss Federal Institute|76574004|385437003
of Technology
(ETH|223517008

in Z?rich|224166006
are
trying
to
design
a carbohydrate-based vaccine.|2331003|398827000|2331003|418836005|398827000

The genome|18470003
of the parasite _Leishmania major_|37763007|51278002
has
been
sequenced|72633008
,
[45] possibly|60022001
allowing
for identification|286672002|7882003
of proteins|88878007
that
are
used|394850002
by the pathogen|264418008
but
not
by humans|278412004
;
these proteins|88878007
are
potential targets|30207005
for drug treatments.|410942007|276239002

On February 2012,
the nonprofit Infectious Disease Research Institute|191415002|385437003
launched
the world?s first human clinical trial|255216001|278412004|110465008|232714002|278412004|110465008
of the visceral leishmaniasis vaccine.|186803007|398827000

The vaccine|398827000
is
a recombinant form|246176004
of two fused Leishmania parasite proteins|420797005|79357004|37763007|88878007
with an adjuvant.|427067006

Two phase 1 clinical trials|420797005|272109004|110465008
with healthy volunteers|263775005|160772005
are
to
be
conducted.|844005

The first one|255216001|421379005|232714002|421379005
takes|419652001
place|257557008|421066005
in Washington (state|421908005
)
and
is
followed|367409002
by a trial|110465008
in India.[46]|223600005

In 2009,
the Hebrew University of Jerusalem Kuvin Center|224871002|26216008
for the Study|110465008|224699009
of Infectious
and
Tropical Diseases,|64572001
in a collaborative effort|19487008
with Addis Ababa University,|224871002
was
awarded
a grant
by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation|27883009|27883009|418836005
for research
into visceral leishmaniasis|186803007
in Ethiopia.|223517008

The project
will
gather data to
be
analyzed
to
identify|7882003
the weak links|13791008|260407003
in the transmission cycle,|258150004|44180009
and
devise methods|260686004|272394005
for control|31509003
of the disease.[47]|64572001

HIV protease inhibitors|19030005|422745008|86406008|422745008|402916007|422745008
have
been
found|404684003
to
be
active|55561003
against _Leishmania_ species|419793002
in two _|420797005
in vitro_ studies|110465008|224699009
in Canada|223686002
and
India.|223600005

The studies|110465008|224699009
reported|229059009|223458004
the intracellular growth|83167003
of parasites|37763007
was
controlled|31509003
by nelfinavir|373445001
and
ritonavir|386896009
in a human monocyte cell line|250436000|55918008|50009006
and
also
in human primary monocyte-derived macrophages.[48]|278412004|63161005|58986001|278412004|261424001|58986001

Since
September 2011 there
exists
a World Community Grid project called Drug Search|133928008|410942007
for Leishmaniasis|80612004
which
has
the goal to|410518001
find
new drugs|7147002|410942007
against this disease.[49]|64572001

While
filming
the latest series|260383002|13039001
of Extreme Dreams|12565001|7175000
in Peru,|223721003
UK television presenter Ben Fogle|255712000
caught|30623001|282673009
the disease.|64572001

He
was
left|7771000
bedridden|160685001
for three weeks|421291004|258705008
on his return home.|7528007|261770009

Fogle
