(Greek ???????|1451003
(_diphthera_
)
"pair

)
is
an upper respiratory tract illness|58675001|39104002|361381009|39104002
caused|23981006|134198009
by _Corynebacterium diphtheriae_,|5851001|428126001
a facultative anaerobic, Gram-positive bacterium.|8745002

It
is
characterized
by sore throat,|405737000|267102003
low fever,|62482003|386661006|371880002|386661006
and
an adherent membrane|83097008
(
a _pseudomembrane_|399016005
)
on the tonsils,|75573002
pharynx,|54066008|181211006
and/or
nasal cavity.|279549004|263481003

A milder form|255604002|246176004
of diphtheria|397428000
can
be
restricted|263856008
to the skin.|119325001|39937001|181469002

Less common consequences|276139006|72906007|103332005|263796003|72906007|103332005
include|55919000
myocarditis|50920009
(about 20%
of cases|398241000|413769002
)
[4]|260308009
and
peripheral neuropathy|42658009
(about 10%
of cases|398241000|413769002
).[5]|264706000|264605009

Diphtheria|397428000
is
a contagious disease|191415002
spread|410677005
by direct physical contact|255589003|76933008
or
breathing|14910006|258162000
the aerosolized secretions|46242002
of infected individuals.|125676002|385435006

Historically quite common, diphtheria|72906007|397428000
has
largely
been
eradicated
in industrialized nations
through widespread vaccination.|85333001

In the United States,|223688001
for example,
there
were
52 reported cases|229059009|398241000|229059009|413769002|223458004|398241000|223458004|413769002
of diphtheria|397428000
between 1980
and
2000
;
between 2000
and
2007,
there
were
only three cases[6]|50607009|421291004|398241000|50607009|421291004|413769002|420295001|421291004|398241000|420295001|421291004|413769002
as the diphtheria?pertussis?tetanus (DPT) vaccine|421245007|125580002
is
recommended
for all school-age children.|160498000|424144002

Boosters
of the vaccine|398827000
are
recommended
for adults,|133936004
since
the benefits
of the vaccine decrease|398827000|260400001|398827000|260370003
with age|424144002
without constant re-exposure|228877007|71677004|228877007|24932003
;
they
are
particularly
recommended
for those traveling|420008001
to areas|42798000
where the disease|64572001
has
not
been
eradicated.

The symptoms
of diphtheria usually|397428000
begin|255395001
two|420797005
to seven days|420359007|258703001
after infection.

Symptoms
of diphtheria|397428000
include|55919000
fever|386661006
of 38?C|264670000
(100.4?F)|372639009
or
above, chills,|261183002|43724002
fatigue,|84229001
bluish skin coloration,|119325001|39937001|181469002
sore throat,|405737000|267102003

cough,|272039006
headache,|25064002
difficulty swallowing,|40739000
painful swallowing,|30233002
difficulty breathing,|267036007
rapid breathing,|271823003

and
lymphadenopathy.|111590001|30746006

Symptoms
can
also
include|55919000
cardiac arrhythmias,
myocarditis,|50920009
and
cranial|89546000|66787007
and
peripheral nerve palsies._[citation|84782009|44695005|244457007|44695005

Diphtheria toxin|55123007
is
produced
by _C.

diphtheriae_ only
when
infected
with a bacteriophage|67068001
that
integrates
the toxin-|80917008
encoding
genetic elements|3950001|57795002|255395001|57795002
into the bacteria.[9][10]|409822003

Diphtheria toxin|55123007
is
a single, 60,000 molecular weight protein|125681006|290005005|27113001|88878007|125681006|290005005|272102008|88878007|125681006|290005005|39857003|88878007|50607009|290005005|27113001|88878007|50607009|290005005|272102008|88878007|50607009|290005005|39857003|88878007
composed
of two peptide chains,|420797005|52642002|46666003
fragment|29140007
A
and
fragment B,|29140007
held|421139008
together
by a disulfide bond.

Fragment B is|29140007
a recognition subunit|312020002
that
gains|35105006|255396000|260366006|260369004|398092000
the toxin entry|80917008
into the host cell|4421005|362837007
by binding|257768005
to the EGF-
like domain
of heparin-binding EGF-like growth factor|96382006|257768005|81286007
(HB-EGF|38082009
)
on the cell surface.|4421005|410678000|362837007|410678000

This
signals|38952000
the cell to|4421005|362837007
internalize
the toxin|80917008
within an endosome
via receptor-mediated endocytosis.|116647005|73510009

Inside the endosome,
the toxin|80917008
is
split
by a trypsin-like protease|66124006|116536008
into its individual A|125676002|385435006
and
B fragments.|29140007

The acidity|34957004
of the endosome causes|134198009
fragment|29140007
B to
create
pores
in the endosome membrane,|83097008
thereby
catalyzing
the release|58000006|68776005|258760001|129299003|115956009
of fragment A|29140007
into the cell's cytoplasm.|4421005|362837007

Fragment|29140007
A
inhibits|61511001
the synthesis|11798007
of new proteins|7147002|88878007
in the affected cell.|247591002|4421005|247591002|362837007|248448006|4421005|248448006|362837007

It
does
this
by catalyzing ADP-ribosylation
of elongation factor EF-2?
a protein|88878007
that
is
essential|34325006
to the translation step|398298007
of protein synthesis.|88878007|11798007

This ADP-ribosylation
involves|248448006
the transfer|302265009
of an ADP-ribose|16850006
from NAD+|131143000
to a diphthamide
(
a modified histidine residue|60260004|65320000|243326001|60260004|65320000
within the EF-2 protein.|88878007

Since
EF-2
is
needed|410525008|103325001
for the moving
of tRNA|28935008
from the A-site|10546003
to the P-site|20304007|10546003
of the ribosome|26761006
during protein translation,
ADP-ribosylation
of EF-2
prevents|116699007
protein synthesis.|88878007|11798007

ADP-ribosylation
of EF-2
is
reversed
by
giving|419582001
high doses|261829003
of nicotinamide|63639004|173196005|105259002
(
a form|246176004
of vitamin B3|173196005
)
,
since
this
is
one|421379005
of the reaction's end-products,|263851003|261782000|263851003|422117008
and
high amounts|75540009|107651007|371879000|107651007
will
drive|247750002
the reaction|263851003
in the opposite direction._[citation|260672003

The current definition|15240007
of diphtheria|397428000
used|394850002
by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|26216008|64572001|31509003|169443000
(CDC
)
is
based|418836005
on
both
laboratory|261904005
and
clinical criteria.|58147004

Empirical treatment|276239002|416118004
should
generally
be
started|385652002
in a patient|116154003
in whom suspicion|22927000
of diphtheria|397428000
is
high.|75540009|371879000

The disease|64572001
may
remain
manageable,
but
in more severe cases,|242762006|24484000|398241000|242762006|24484000|413769002
lymph nodes|59441001
in the neck|45048000|302550007
may
swell,|423666004|442672001
and
breathing|14910006|258162000
and
swallowing|54731003|288937009
will
be
more difficult.|242762006|52925006

People|125676002
in this stage|21191007|371508000|261612004
should
seek
immediate medical attention,|88694003|74188005|6769007|49499008|74188005|6769007
as
obstruction|26036001
in the throat|54066008|49928004|264231000
may
require
intubation|52765003
or
a tracheotomy.|48387007

Abnormal cardiac rhythms
can
occur|272120004
early|264499004
in the course|288524001
of the illness|39104002
or
weeks later,|258705008
and
can
lead|88488004
to heart failure.|84114007|42343007

Diphtheria|397428000
can
also
cause|23981006|134198009
paralysis|44695005
in the eye,|81745001|244486005
neck,|45048000|302550007
throat,|54066008|49928004|264231000
or
respiratory muscles.|86419007

Patients|116154003
with severe cases|24484000|398241000|24484000|413769002
will
be
put
in a hospital intensive care unit|309904001|285201006|309904001
and
be
given|419582001
a diphtheria antitoxin.|412175006

Since
antitoxin|71862009
does
not
neutralize
toxin|80917008
that
is
already
bound|75958009|257768005|418131003
to tissues,|85756007
delaying
its administration|413454004|416118004
is
associated|47429007
with an increase|260366006
in mortality risk.|409651001|30207005

Therefore,
the decision
to administer diphtheria antitoxin|418283001|412175006
is
based|418836005
on clinical diagnosis,|39154008
and
should
not
await
laboratory confirmation.[6]|261904005|74996004

Antibiotics|255631004
have
not
been
demonstrated
to
affect|4065008
healing|298005009|90910008
of local infection|255470001
in diphtheria patients|397428000|116154003
treated|28995006
with antitoxin.|71862009

Antibiotics|255631004
are
used|394850002
in patients|116154003
or
carriers|47461006
to eradicate _C.

diphtheriae_
and
prevent
its transmission|258150004
to others.|74964007

The CDC recommends[12]
either
:

In cases|398241000|413769002
that
progress|385651009
beyond a throat infection,|405737000
diphtheria toxin|55123007
spreads|410677005
through the blood|87612001|119273009
and
can
lead|88488004
to potentially life-threatening complications|224130005|116223007
that
affect|4065008
other organs,|74964007|410653004
such as the heart|80891009|302509004
and
kidneys.|64033007|17373004

The toxin|80917008
can
cause|23981006|134198009
damage|37782003
to the heart|80891009|302509004
that
affects|4065008
its ability to|371150009
pump|44668000
blood|87612001|119273009
or
the kidneys' ability to|64033007|371150009|17373004|371150009
clear|263707001
wastes.

It
can
also
cause|23981006|134198009
nerve damage,|57182000
eventually
leading|236874000
to paralysis.|44695005

About 40%|259031006
to 50%
of those left untreated|7771000|25265005
can
die.|419620001|399069006|419099009

Diphtheria|397428000
is
a serious disease,|42745003|64572001
with fatality rates|399166001
between 5%|264706000|264605009
and
10%.

In children|410601007|160499008
under five years|421820001|258707000
and
adults|133936004
over 40 years,|259031006|258707000
the fatality rate|399166001
may
be
as
much
as 20%.

Outbreaks,|443684005
though
very rare, still|260358002|84638005|260358002|103356009
occur|272120004

Canada.|223686002

After the breakup
of the former Soviet Union|9130008
in the late 1980s,|260383002
vaccination rates
in its constituent countries|312297002|223369002
fell|1912002
so low|223528007|62482003|223528007|371880002
that there
was
an explosion|397996002|19440001
of diphtheria cases.|397428000|398241000|397428000|413769002

In 1991,
there
were
2,000 cases|260306008|398241000|260306008|413769002
of diphtheria|397428000
in the USSR.

By 1998,
according to Red Cross estimates,|386713009|65145006|414135002|371240000|65145006|414135002
there
were

This
was
so great|223528007|255509001|223528007|263768009
an increase|260366006
that diphtheria|397428000
was
cited
in the Guinness Book|226507008|278212002
of World Records
as "most resurgent disease"._[citation|4757001|64572001
needed|410525008|103325001

The disease|64572001
was
named|27468005
by French doctor Pierre Bretonneau|19434008|309343006
in 1826
(
substituted
for his earlier term _diphth?rite_|264499004
).

In 1878,
Queen Victoria's daughter Princess Alice|223781001|66089001|264780009
and
her family|35359004
became
infected
with it,
causing|23981006
two deaths,|420797005|419620001|420797005|268923008
Princess Marie
of Hesse
and
by Rhine|260540009|181195007
and
Princess Alice|264780009
herself.

In the 1920s,
there
were
an estimated 100,000|414135002
to 200,000 cases|398241000|413769002
of diphtheria|397428000
per year|258707000|259039008

per year.|258707000|259039008

Children|410601007|160499008
represented
a large majority|255509001
of these cases|398241000|413769002

for diphtheria|397428000
was
discovered
in the 1880s
by U.S.|223688001

physician Joseph O'Dwyer|309343006
(1841?1898
).

O'Dwyer developed tubes|257971007|83059008|257971007|418530008
that
were
inserted|257867005
into the throat,|54066008|49928004|264231000
and
prevented victims|116699007
from suffocating|66466001
due to the membrane sheath|83097008
that
grows
over
and
obstructs|263821009
airways.|43725001|89187006

In 1884,
Friedrich Loeffler
discovered
the causative organism|410653004
(_Corynebacterium diphtheriae_|5851001|428126001
).

In December 1890,
the German physician Emil von Behring|7695005|309343006
developed
an antitoxin|71862009
that
did
not
kill|248007002
the bacterium,|409822003
but
neutralized
the toxic poisons|35331000
the bacterium|409822003
releases|115956009
into the body.|279495008|123037004

Von Behring
discovered
that animal blood|387961004|87612001|387961004|119273009
has
antitoxins|71862009
in it,
so
he
took|419652001
the blood,|87612001|119273009
removed|127485006
the clotting agents|260872001
and
injected|422145002
it
into human patients.|278412004|116154003

"
The paper|50833004
shook|26079004
the scientific world.

Work|261041009
on diphtheria|397428000
at a level|258395000|276625007
of intensity heretofore|103370009
unknown|261665006

in laboratories.|261904005

Over the Christmas holiday
in 1891
in Berlin,
the
first
attempt
to
cure
a person|125676002
of diphtheria|397428000
was
made.

It
succeeded.

[14] Von Behring
was
awarded
the first Nobel Prize|255216001|232714002
in Medicine|410942007
for his role
in the discovery,
and
development|278923009
of a serum therapy|67922002|276239002
for diphtheria.|397428000

and
Anna Wessels Williams,
and
Pasteur Institute scientists Emile Roux|385437003|308027003
and
Auguste Chaillou also independently developed diphtheria antitoxin|412175006
in the 1890s.

The first successful vaccine|255216001|385669000|398827000|232714002|385669000|398827000
for diphtheria|397428000
was
developed
in 1913
by Behring.

However,
antibiotics|255631004
against diphtheria|397428000
were
not available|103328004
until the discovery
and
development|278923009
of sulfa drugs.|410942007

The Schick test,|164971000
invented
between 1910
and
1911,
is
a test|269814003|272393004
used|394850002
to
determine
whether
or
not
a person|125676002
is
susceptible|131196009
to diphtheria.|397428000

It
was
named|27468005
after its inventor,
B?la Schick
(1877?1967
)
,
a Hungarian-born American pediatrician.|297923001|82296001

A massive five-year campaign|46998006|421820001|258707000|46998006|421820001|259039008
was
coordinated|162258009
by Dr.|309343006

Schick.

As a part|260726005
of the campaign,
85 million pieces
of literature
were
distributed
by the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company|224130005
with an appeal
to parents|40683002
to "
Save your child|410601007|160499008
from diphtheria."|397428000
A vaccine|398827000
was
developed
in the next decade,|18769003|255260001
and
deaths|419620001|268923008
began|255395001
declining
in earnest
in 1924.[15]

In early May 2010,|264499004
a case|398241000
of diphtheria|397428000
was
diagnosed|439401001
