(short|359530003|367450005
for _tubercle bacillus_
)
is
a common,|72906007
and
in many cases lethal, infectious disease|398241000|191415002|413769002|191415002
caused|23981006|134198009
by various strains|256220008|48532005|256220008|276768000
of mycobacteria,|243368001
usually _Mycobacterium tuberculosis_.|113861009

Tuberculosis typically|371569005
attacks|216299002
the lungs,|39607008
but
can
also
affect|4065008
other parts|74964007|260726005
of the body.|279495008|123037004

It
is
spread|410677005
through the air|417696007
when
people|125676002
who
have
an active TB infection cough,|55561003|272039006
sneeze,|162367006
or
otherwise
transmit|60117003
their saliva|256897009
through the air.|417696007

Most infections
are
asymptomatic|84387000
and
latent,|44104002
but
about
one|421379005
in ten latent infections eventually|23067006|44104002|420258001|44104002
progresses|385651009
to active disease|55561003|64572001
which,
if
left untreated, kills more|7771000|25265005|248007002
than 50%
of those so|223528007
infected.

The classic symptoms|255301002|255333006
of active TB infection|55561003
are
a chronic cough|68154008
with blood-tinged sputum,|66857006|61281005
fever,|386661006
night sweats,|42984000
and
weight loss|89362005
(
the latter
giving|419582001
rise
to the formerly prevalent term "consumption"
).

Infection
of other organs|74964007|410653004
causes|134198009
a wide range|90522003
of symptoms.

Diagnosis|439401001
of active TB|55561003
relies
on radiology|394914008|363680008
(commonly chest X-rays,|399208008
as well as
microscopic examination|117259009
and
microbiological culture|252398009|61594008
of body fluids.|32457005

Diagnosis|439401001
of latent TB|44104002
relies
on the tuberculin skin test (TST)|424294008
and/or
blood tests.|252275004

Treatment|276239002|416118004
is
difficult|52925006
and
requires
administration|413454004|416118004
of multiple antibiotics|260396001|255631004
over a long period|255511005|259037005
of time.|410669006

Social contacts|129874008
are
also
screened|20135006|360156006
and
treated|28995006
if necessary.

Antibiotic resistance|255631004|30714006
is
a growing problem|55607006
in multiple drug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) infections.|260396001|423709000

Prevention|169443000
relies
on screening programs|20135006
and
vaccination
with the bacillus Calmette?Gu?rin vaccine.|44762009|418571002|1017006|418571002

One third|421379005|70905002
of the world's population|385436007|389109008
is
thought to|88952004
have
been
infected
with _M.|258311008

tuberculosis_,|371569005
[3]|260313008
with new infections|255219008
occurring|272120004
at a rate
of about
one|421379005
per second.|81170007|257997001|288495006

In 2007,
there
were
an estimated 13.7 million chronic active cases globally,|414135002|47501007|398241000|414135002|47501007|413769002
[4]|260308009
while
in 2010,
there
were
an estimated 8.8 million new cases|414135002|7147002|398241000|414135002|7147002|413769002
and
1.5 million associated deaths,|264623001|47429007|419620001|264623001|47429007|268923008
mostly
occurring|272120004
in developing countries.|223369002

The absolute number|56136002|410680006|56136002|410681005
of tuberculosis cases|371569005|398241000|371569005|413769002
has
been
decreasing|260371004
since 2006,
and
new cases|7147002|398241000|7147002|413769002
have
decreased|1250004|260400001|260371004
since 2002.

The distribution|255464007
of tuberculosis|371569005
is
not uniform|27617004
across the globe|81745001|244486005
;
about 80%
of the population|385436007|389109008
in many Asian|414978006
and
African countries|223508008
test|269814003|272393004
positive|258758003|10828004
in tuberculin tests,|424294008
while
only 5?10%|50607009|420295001
of the United States population|223688001|385436007|223688001|389109008
tests|269814003|272393004
positive.|258758003|10828004

More people|242762006|125676002
in the developing world contract tuberculosis|371569005
because of compromised immunity,|58915005
largely
due to high rates|75540009|371879000
of HIV infection|86406008
and
the corresponding development|278923009
of AIDS.[6]|62479008

About 5?10%|264706000|264605009
of those without HIV,|45169001|19030005|45169001|86406008|45169001|402916007
infected
with tuberculosis,|371569005
develop
active disease|55561003|64572001
during their lifetimes.

In contrast,
30%
of those
coinfected
with HIV|19030005|86406008|402916007
develop
active disease.|55561003|64572001

Tuberculosis|371569005
may
infect
any part|260726005
of the body,|279495008|123037004
but
most commonly|4757001
occurs|272120004
in the lungs|39607008
(
known|36692007
as pulmonary tuberculosis|154283005
).

Extrapulmonary TB|423997002
occurs|272120004
when
tuberculosis|371569005
develops
outside of the lungs.|39607008

Extrapulmonary TB|423997002
may
coexist
with pulmonary TB|154283005
as well.|20572008

General signs|60132005|72670004
and
symptoms
include|55919000
fever,|386661006
chills,|43724002
night sweats,|42984000
loss
of appetite,|33911006
weight loss,|89362005
and
fatigue,|84229001
[9]
and
significant finger clubbing|386134007|30760008
may
also
occur.[8]|272120004

If
a tuberculosis infection|371569005
does
become
active,|55561003
it most commonly|4757001
involves|248448006
the lungs|39607008
(
in about 90%|264705001|264703008
of cases|398241000|413769002
).

Symptoms
may
include|55919000
chest pain|29857009
and
a prolonged cough producing sputum.|255224006|272039006|28743005

About 25%
of people|125676002
may
not
have
any symptoms
(i.e.|42146005|22971001

they
remain
"asymptomatic"|84387000
).

Occasionally,
people|125676002
may
cough|272039006
up blood|87612001|119273009
in small amounts,|255507004|107651007
and
in very rare cases,|260358002|84638005|398241000|260358002|84638005|413769002|260358002|103356009|398241000|260358002|103356009|413769002
the infection
may
erode|424714008
into the pulmonary artery,|45341000|181380003
resulting|42752001
in massive bleeding|112648003
(Rasmussen's aneurysm.|14889002

Tuberculosis|371569005
may
become
a chronic illness|27624003
and
cause|23981006|134198009
extensive scarring|41118005|41118005|275322007
in the upper lobes|261183002
of the lungs.|39607008

The upper lung lobes|261183002|31094006
are
more frequently|242762006|70232002
affected|247591002|248448006
by tuberculosis|371569005
than the lower ones.|261122009|421379005

The reason|410666004
for this difference|263735002
is
not entirely
clear.|263707001

It
may
be
due|42752001
either
to better air flow,|3442003|417696007
[1]|260305007
or
to poor lymph drainage|11403006|234303003|255351007|234303003
within the upper lungs.[9]|261183002|39607008

In 15?20%
of active cases,|55561003|398241000|55561003|413769002
the infection
spreads|410677005
outside the respiratory organs,|272626006
causing|23981006
other kinds|74964007|261664005
of TB.

These
are
collectively
denoted
as "extrapulmonary tuberculosis".|423997002

Extrapulmonary TB|423997002
occurs|272120004
more commonly|242762006
in immunosuppressed persons|125676002
and
young children.|84422007|410601007|84422007|160499008

In those with HIV,|20401003|19030005|20401003|86406008|20401003|402916007|421463005|19030005|421463005|86406008|421463005|402916007
this
occurs|272120004
in more|242762006
than 50%
of cases.|398241000|413769002

Notable extrapulmonary infection sites|301810000
include|55919000
the pleura|3120008|181609007
(
in tuberculous pleurisy|186182003
)
,
the central nervous system|21483005|278199004
(
in tuberculous meningitis,|58437007
the lymphatic system|89890002
(
in scrofula|54084005
of the neck|45048000|302550007
)
,
the genitourinary system|21514008|278861008
(
in urogenital tuberculosis,|4445009
and
the bones|272673000|128530007
and
joints|39352004|81087007
(
in Pott's disease|35984006
of the spine|421060004|44300000|243930007
)
,
among others.|74964007

When
it
spreads|410677005
to the bones,|272673000|128530007
it
is
also
known|36692007
as "osseous tuberculosis".|272673000|371569005|3138006|371569005

a form|246176004
of osteomyelitis.|60168000

A potentially more serious, widespread form|42745003|85333001|246176004
of TB
is
called "
disseminated|65709003
" TB,
commonly
known|36692007
as miliary tuberculosis.|47604008

Miliary TB|47604008
makes
up about 10%
of extrapulmonary cases.[14]|398241000|413769002

The main cause|63161005|134198009
of TB
is
_Mycobacterium tuberculosis_,|113861009
a small, aerobic, nonmotile bacillus.|255507004|27471002|44762009|255507004|27471002|1017006

The high lipid content|124042003|276824008
of this pathogen|264418008
accounts
for many|260396001
of its unique clinical characteristics.|58147004

It
divides|422033008
every 16
to 20 hours,|258702006
which
is
an extremely slow rate|419443000
compared
with other bacteria,|74964007|409822003
which usually
divide|422033008
in less|276139006|263796003
than an hour.|258702006|286551008

Mycobacteria|243368001
have
an outer membrane lipid bilayer.|261074009|83097008

If
a Gram stain|385484003|62777006
is
performed,|398166005
MTB
either
stains|397165007|127790008
very weakly "Gram-positive"|260358002|260408008|258682000
or
does
not
retain|397909002
dye|61789006
as a result|394617004
of the high lipid|124042003
and
mycolic acid content|34957004|276824008
of its cell wall.|4421005|224727009|362837007|224727009

MTB
can
withstand
weak disinfectants|13791008|311942001|260407003|311942001
and
survive
in a dry state|13880007|398070004
for weeks.|258705008

In nature,|277302009
the bacterium|409822003
can
grow
only
within the cells|4421005
of a host organism,|410653004
but
_M.|258311008

tuberculosis_|371569005
can
be
cultured|252398009|61594008
in the laboratory.[19]|261904005

Using|260676000
histological stains|67151002|397165007|67151002|127790008
on expectorated samples|288971000|123038009
from phlegm|52024008
(also
called
"sputum"|45710003
)
,
scientists|308027003
can
identify|7882003
MTB
under a regular|17854005
(light) microscope.|56242006|65473004|371268001|65473004

Since
MTB
retains|397909002
certain stains even|17162000|397165007|17162000|127790008
after
being
treated|28995006
with acidic solution,|34957004|8537005|34957004|77899000
it
is
classified|73504009
as an acid-fast bacillus (AFB).|243365003

The most common acid-fast staining techniques|4757001|72906007|67122001|272394005|4757001|72906007|406976001|272394005
are
the Ziehl?
Neelsen stain,|397165007|127790008
which dyes AFBs|61789006|243365003
a bright red|386717005
that stands out clearly|282972001
against a blue background,|405738005
[20]
and
the auramine-rhodamine stain|255794000|406977005|406800009|406977005|81397005|406977005|81397005|117328005

_M.|258311008

africanum_
is
not widespread,|85333001
but
it
is
a significant cause|386134007|134198009
of tuberculosis|371569005
in parts|260726005
of Africa.|223498002

_M.|258311008

bovis_|385587008
was
once
a common cause|72906007|134198009
of tuberculosis,|371569005
but
the introduction|107733003
of pasteurized milk|3718001|119321005|70813002
has
largely
eliminated
this
as a public health problem|310115006|55607006
in developed countries.|223369002

_M.|258311008

canetti_
is
rare|84638005|103356009
and
seems
to
be
limited|255469002
to the Horn|69221006
of Africa,|223498002
although
a few cases|57176003|398241000|57176003|413769002
have
been
seen
in African emigrants.|413464008

_M.|258311008

microti_
is
also rare|84638005|103356009
and
is
mostly
seen
in immunodeficient people,|234532001|125676002
although
the prevalence
of this pathogen|264418008
has
possibly|60022001
been
significantly
underestimated.[28]

Other known pathogenic mycobacteria|74964007|36692007|264418008|243368001

cause|23981006|134198009
pulmonary diseases|19829001
that
resemble
TB.[29]

A number|410680006|410681005
of factors
make
people|125676002
more susceptible|242762006|131196009
to TB infections.

The most important risk factor globally|4757001|80943009
is
HIV|19030005|86406008|402916007
;
13%
of all TB cases|398241000|413769002
are
infected
by the virus.|49872002

This
is
a particular problem|55607006
in sub-Saharan Africa,|409988000
where rates
of HIV|19030005|86406008|402916007
are
high.|75540009|371879000

Tuberculosis|371569005
is
closely
linked
to
both
overcrowding
and
malnutrition,|248325000
making
it
one|421379005
of the principal diseases|63161005|64572001|302311007|64572001
of poverty.|11403006

Those at high risk thus|15508007
include|55919000
:
people|125676002
who
inject|422145002
illicit drugs,|77657003
inhabitants
and
employees|224528001
of locales
where vulnerable people gather|125676002
(e.g.|258795003

prisons
and
homeless shelters|266935003
)
,
medically
underprivileged
and
resource-poor communities,|11403006|133928008|255351007|133928008
high-risk ethnic minorities,|15508007|397731000|410599005|15508007|397731000|255606000
children|410601007|160499008
in close contact|29179001|11723008|29179001|70862002
with high-risk category patients|15508007|116154003
and
health care providers
serving
these clients.

Chronic lung disease|413839001
is
another significant risk factor ?|386134007|80943009
with silicosis|805002
increasing|260369004
the risk|30207005
about 30-fold.|26310004

Those
who
smoke|64197008|102407002
cigarettes
have
nearly
twice the risk|30207005
of TB
than nonsmokers.|8392000

Other disease states|74964007|64572001|398070004
can
also
increase|260366006
the risk|30207005
of developing tuberculosis,|371569005
including|55919000
alcoholism[6]|7200002
and
diabetes mellitus|73211009
(threefold increase|260366006
).

Certain medications,|17162000|410942007
such as corticosteroids|79440004
and
infliximab|386891004
(
an anti-?TNF monoclonal antibody|49616005
)
are
becoming
increasingly important risk factors,|80943009
especially
in the developed world.

There
is
also
a genetic susceptibility[36]|47708004
for which overall importance
is
still
undefined.[6]

When
people|125676002
with active pulmonary TB cough,|55561003|154283005|272039006
sneeze,|162367006
speak,|87335007|286370002
sing|223593008|57206007
,
or
spit,|12405001
they
expel
infectious aerosol droplets 0.5|64242006|260316000|52262001|260316000
to 5.0 ?m|264706000|264605009
in diameter.|81827009

A single sneeze|125681006|162367006|50607009|162367006
can
release|58000006|68776005|258760001|129299003|115956009
up to 40,000 droplets.|259031006

Each one|421379005
of these droplets
may
transmit|60117003
the disease,|64572001
since
the infectious dose|277406006|408102007
of tuberculosis|371569005
is
very low|260362008
(
the inhalation|14910006|422237004
of fewer|57176003
than 10 bacteria|409822003
may
cause|23981006|134198009
an infection
).[38]|264670000

People|125676002
with prolonged, frequent,|255224006|70232002
or
close contact|29179001|11723008|29179001|70862002
with people|125676002
with TB
are
at particularly high risk|15508007
of
becoming
infected,
with an estimated 22% infection rate.|414135002

A person|125676002
with active|55561003
but
untreated tuberculosis|25265005|371569005
may
infect
10?15
(
or
more
)
other people|74964007|125676002
per year.|258707000|259039008

Transmission|258150004
should
only
occur|272120004
from people|125676002
with active TB -|55561003
those
with latent infection|44104002
are
not
thought|88952004
to
be
contagious.

The probability|2931005
of transmission|258150004
from one person|421379005|125676002
to another
depends
upon several factors,|261028005
including|55919000
the number|410680006|410681005
of infectious droplets
expelled
by the carrier,|47461006|29679002
the effectiveness|255403003
of ventilation,|258162000|45444009
the duration|103335007
of exposure,|71677004|24932003
the virulence
of the _M.|258311008

tuberculosis_ strain,|371569005|48532005|371569005|276768000
the level|258395000|276625007
of immunity|58915005
in the uninfected person,|125676002
and
others.|74964007

The cascade
of person-to-person|125676002
spread|410677005
can
be
circumvented
by effectively
segregating
those
with active|55561003
("overt"
)
TB
and
putting
them
on anti-TB drug regimens.|410942007

After
about two weeks|420797005|258705008
of effective treatment,|255403003|276239002|255403003|416118004|254648000|276239002|254648000|416118004
subjects
with nonresistant active infections generally|55561003
do
not
remain
contagious
to others.|74964007

If
someone
does
become
infected,
it typically
takes|419652001
three|421291004
to four weeks|421534005|258705008
before the newly infected person|125676002
becomes
infectious enough to
transmit|60117003
the disease|64572001
to others.[41]|74964007

About 90%|264705001|264703008
of those
infected
with _M.|258311008

tuberculosis_|371569005
have
asymptomatic, latent TB infections|28456004|44104002
(sometimes
called
LTBI
)
,
[42]
with only a 10% lifetime chance|50607009|420295001
that
the latent infection|44104002
will
progress|385651009
to overt, active tuberculous disease.|427099000|64572001

In those with HIV,|20401003|19030005|20401003|86406008|20401003|402916007|421463005|19030005|421463005|86406008|421463005|402916007
the risk|30207005
of developing active TB|55561003
increases|260366006
to nearly 10%
a year.|258707000|259039008

If effective treatment|255403003|276239002|255403003|416118004|254648000|276239002|254648000|416118004
is
not
given|419582001
,
the death rate|409651001
for active TB cases|55561003|398241000|55561003|413769002
is
up to 66%.[3]

TB infection
begins|255395001
when
the mycobacteria|243368001
reach|282679008
the pulmonary alveoli,|113253006|361364000
where
they
invade
and
replicate|1305003|27582007
within endosomes
of alveolar macrophages.|33956004

The primary site|246312001
of infection
in the lungs,|39607008
known|36692007
as the "Ghon focus",|87017008|363702006
is
generally
located
in
either
the upper part|261183002|260726005
of the lower lobe,|261122009
or
the lower part|261122009|260726005
of the upper lobe.|261183002

Tuberculosis|371569005
of the lungs|39607008
may
also
occur|272120004
via infection
from the blood stream.|87612001|257709004|119273009|257709004

This
is
known|36692007
as a Simon focus|262144001|87017008|262144001|363702006
and
is
typically
found|404684003
in the top|421812003
of the lung.|39607008|181216001

This hematogenous transmission|258150004
can
also spread infection|410677005
to more distant sites,|242762006|261007001|10546003
such as peripheral lymph nodes,|14414005|59441001
the kidneys,|64033007|17373004
the brain,|12738006|258335003
and
the bones.|272673000|128530007

All parts|260726005
of the body|279495008|123037004
can
be
affected|247591002|248448006
by the disease,|64572001
though
for unknown reasons|261665006|410666004
it rarely|103356009
affects|4065008
the heart,|80891009|302509004
skeletal muscles,|127954009
pancreas,|15776009|181277001
or
thyroid.[47]|69748006|61020000

Tuberculosis|371569005
is
classified|73504009
as one|421379005
of the granulomatous inflammatory diseases.|128561003|255448004|128139000

Macrophages,|58986001
T lymphocytes,|57184004
B lymphocytes,|112130006
and
fibroblasts|52547004
are
among the cells|4421005
that
aggregate|18403000
to
form|246176004
granulomas,|45647009
with lymphocytes|56972008|446325007
surrounding|355648006
the infected macrophages.|58986001

The granuloma|45647009
prevents|116699007
dissemination|65709003
of the mycobacteria|243368001
and
provides
a local environment|255470001|276339004
for interaction
of cells|4421005
of the immune system.|116003000

Bacteria|409822003
inside the granuloma|45647009
can
become
dormant,
resulting|42752001
in latent infection.|44104002

Another feature
of the granulomas|45647009
is
the development|278923009
of abnormal cell death|39266006|419620001|39266006|268923008
(necrosis|6574001
in the center|26216008
of tubercles.|69824008

To the naked eye,|248160001|81745001|248160001|244486005
this
has
the texture|246200002
of soft, white cheese|226848002|413773004|226848002|185984009|226848002|371251000
and
is
termed caseous necrosis.[48]|33940009

If TB bacteria gain entry|409822003
to the bloodstream
from an area|42798000
of damaged tissue,|37782003
they
can
spread|410677005
throughout the body|279495008|123037004
and
set up|255532002|353734004
many foci|87017008
of infection,
all
appearing
as tiny,
white tubercles|413773004|69824008|185984009|69824008|371251000|69824008
in the tissues.|85756007

This severe form|24484000|246176004
of TB disease,|64572001
most common|72906007
in young children|84422007|410601007|84422007|160499008
and
those
with HIV,|19030005|86406008|402916007
is
called miliary tuberculosis.|47604008

People|125676002
with this disseminated TB|181198009
have
a high fatality rate even|75540009|399166001|371879000|399166001
with treatment|276239002|416118004
(about 30%
).[14][51]

In many people,|125676002
the infection waxes|69637009
and
wanes.

Tissue destruction|85756007|64597002
and
necrosis|6574001
are
often|70232002
balanced|78933003
by healing|298005009|90910008
and
fibrosis.|263756000

Affected tissue|247591002|85756007|248448006|85756007
is
replaced|282089006|370124000
by scarring|275322007
and
cavities|80967001|91806002|2483006
filled
with caseous necrotic material.|33940009|260769002

During active disease,|55561003|64572001
some
of these cavities|80967001|91806002|2483006
are
joined
to the air passages bronchi|417696007|255592004|955009
and
this material|260769002
can
be
coughed|272039006|289114008
up.

It
contains|42504009
living bacteria,|409822003
and
so|223528007
can
spread|410677005
the infection.

Treatment|276239002|416118004
with appropriate antibiotics|255631004
kills|248007002
bacteria|409822003
and
allows
healing to|298005009|90910008
take|419652001
place.|257557008|421066005

Upon cure,
affected areas|247591002|42798000|248448006|42798000
are
eventually
replaced|282089006|370124000
by scar tissue.[48]|70582006|275322007

Diagnosing|439401001
active tuberculosis|427099000
based|418836005
merely
on signs|72670004
and
symptoms
is
difficult,[52] as is|52925006
diagnosing|439401001
the disease|64572001
in those
who
are
immunosuppressed.

A diagnosis|439401001
of TB
should
,
however,
be
considered
in those with signs|20401003|72670004|421463005|72670004
of lung disease|19829001
or
constitutional symptoms
lasting
longer|255511005
than two weeks.|420797005|258705008

A chest X-ray|399208008
and
multiple sputum cultures|260396001|104173009
for acid-fast bacilli|243365003
are
typically part|260726005
of the initial evaluation.|884001|884001|386053000|232714002|232714002|386053000

Interferon-?|49327004
release assays|58000006|58779000|58000006|272392009|68776005|58779000|68776005|272392009|258760001|58779000|258760001|272392009|129299003|58779000|129299003|272392009|115956009|58779000|115956009|272392009
and
tuberculin skin tests|424294008
are
of little use|277889008|419385000
in the developing world.

IGRA
have
similar limitations|246175000
in those with HIV.[55][56]|20401003|19030005|264691008|20401003|86406008|264691008|20401003|402916007|264691008|421463005|19030005|264691008|421463005|86406008|264691008|421463005|402916007|264691008

A definitive diagnosis|261002007|439401001|261002007
of TB
is
made
by identifying _M.|7882003

tuberculosis_|371569005
in a clinical sample|58147004|123038009
(e.g.|258795003

sputum,|45710003
pus,|11311000|119323008
or
a tissue biopsy.|85756007|86273004

However,
the difficult culture process|52925006|252398009|415178003|52925006|61594008|415178003
for this slow-growing organism|419443000|410653004
can
take|419652001
two|420797005
to six weeks|422218008|258705008
for blood|87612001|119273009
or
sputum culture.|104173009

Thus,
treatment|276239002|416118004
is
often|70232002
begun|255395001
before cultures|252398009|61594008
are
confirmed.[58]|59156000

Nucleic acid amplification tests|69363007
and
adenosine deaminase testing|30065008|30065008|272393004
may
allow
rapid diagnosis|255358001|439401001|255358001
of TB.

These tests,|269814003|272393004
however,
are
not routinely
recommended
,
as
they rarely|103356009
alter
how
a person|125676002
is
treated.|28995006

Blood tests to|252275004
detect|260373001
antibodies|68498002
are
not specific|69658003
or
sensitive,|83185005
so
they
are
not
recommended.[59]

The Mantoux tuberculin skin test|424489006
is
often|70232002
used to|394850002
screen|20135006|360156006
people|125676002
at high risk|15508007
for TB.

Those
who
have
been
previously
immunized

when
used|394850002
in addition|260364009
to the skin test|53309004
but
may
be
less sensitive|276139006|83185005|263796003|83185005

Tuberculosis prevention|371569005|169443000
and
control efforts primarily|31509003|19487008
rely
on the vaccination
of infants|418119000
and
the detection
and
appropriate treatment|276239002|416118004
of active cases.|55561003|398241000|55561003|413769002

The World Health Organization|263775005|21139007
has
achieved
some success|385669000
with improved treatment regimens,|385425000|276239002|385425000|416118004|3442003|276239002|3442003|416118004
and
a small decrease|255507004|260400001|255507004|260370003
in case numbers.[6]|398241000|410680006|398241000|410681005

The only currently available vaccine|50607009|15240007|103328004|398827000|420295001|15240007|103328004|398827000
as of 2011
is
bacillus Calmette?Gu?rin (BCG)|44762009|1017006
which,
while
it
is
effective|255403003|254648000
against disseminated disease|65709003|64572001
in childhood,|68433009
confers
inconsistent protection|260380004
against contracting pulmonary TB.|78558002|154283005

Nevertheless,
it
is
the most widely used vaccine worldwide,|4757001|394850002|398827000
with more|242762006
than 90%|264705001|264703008
of all children|410601007|160499008
being
vaccinated.

However,
the immunity|58915005
it
induces|16404004
decreases|260370003
after
about ten years.|23067006|258707000|420258001|258707000

As tuberculosis|371569005
is
uncommon|103356009
in most
of Canada,|223686002
the United Kingdom,|223860005

BCG
is
only
administered|418283001
to people|125676002
at high risk.|15508007

Part|260726005
of the reasoning arguing
against the use|277889008|419385000
of the vaccine|398827000
is
that
it
makes
the tuberculin skin test|424294008
falsely positive|258758003|10828004
,
and
therefore,
of no use|277889008|419385000
in screening.|20135006

A number|410680006|410681005
of new vaccines|7147002|398827000

The World Health Organization|263775005|21139007
declared
TB
a "global health emergency"|60132005|263775005|25876001
in 1993,
[6]
and
in 2006,
the Stop TB Partnership|422117008
developed
a Global Plan to|60132005|52713000|60132005|397943006
Stop|422117008
Tuberculosis|371569005
that
aims
to
save 14 million
lives|224130005
between its launch
and
2015.

A number|410680006|410681005
of targets
they
have
set
are
not likely to|2931005
be
achieved
by 2015,
mostly
due to the increase|260366006
in HIV-associated tuberculosis|19030005|47429007|371569005|86406008|47429007|371569005|402916007|47429007|371569005
and
the emergence
of multiple drug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB).|260396001|423709000

A tuberculosis classification system|371569005|73504009
developed
by the American Thoracic Society
is
used primarily|394850002
in public health programs.[69]|310115006|264698002

Treatment|276239002|416118004
of TB
uses|277889008|394850002|260676000|419385000
antibiotics to|255631004
kill|248007002
the bacteria.|409822003

Effective TB treatment|255403003|276239002|255403003|416118004|254648000|276239002|254648000|416118004
is
difficult,|52925006
due to the unusual structure
and
chemical composition|441900009
of the mycobacterial cell wall,|243368001|4421005|224727009|243368001|362837007|224727009
which
hinders
the entry
of drugs|410942007
and
makes
many antibiotics|255631004
ineffective.

The two antibiotics most commonly|420797005|255631004
used|394850002
are
isoniazid|387472004
and
rifampicin,|387159009
and
treatments|276239002
can
be
prolonged|255224006
,
taking|419652001
several months.|261028005|258706009

Latent TB treatment usually|44104002|276239002|44104002|416118004
employs|224363007
a single antibiotic,|125681006|255631004|50607009|255631004
[71]|264699005
while
active TB disease|55561003|64572001
is
best|20572008|3442003
treated|28995006
with combinations|228166004
of several antibiotics to|261028005|255631004
reduce|260400001
the risk|30207005
of the bacteria|409822003
developing
antibiotic resistance.|255631004|30714006

People|125676002
with latent infections|44104002
are
also
treated|28995006
to
prevent
them
from progressing|255314001
to active TB disease later in life.|55561003|64572001|260383002|224130005

Directly observed therapy,
i.e.|42146005|22971001

having
a health care provider
watch
the person|125676002
take|419652001
their medications,|410942007
is
recommended
by the
WHO
in an effort to|19487008
reduce|260400001
the number|410680006|410681005
of people|125676002
not appropriately taking antibiotics.|419652001|255631004

The evidence to|18669006
support|9096001|243114000
this practice
over people simply|125676002
taking|419652001
their medications independently|410942007
is
poor.|11403006|255351007

Methods to|260686004|272394005
remind|223452003
people|125676002
of the importance
of treatment|276239002|416118004
do
however
appear
effective.[74]|255403003|254648000

The recommended treatment|276239002|416118004
of new-onset pulmonary tuberculosis,|7147002|77374008|154283005
as of 2010,
is
six months|422218008|258706009
of a combination|89780004
of antibiotics|255631004
containing|42504009
rifampicin,|387159009
isoniazid,|387472004
pyrazinamide|387076005
and
ethambutol|387129004
for the first two months,|255216001|420797005|258706009|232714002|420797005|258706009
and
only rifampicin|50607009|387159009|420295001|387159009
and
isoniazid|387472004
for the last four months.|421534005|258706009

Where resistance|30714006
to isoniazid|387472004
is
high, ethambutol|75540009|387129004|371879000|387129004
may
be
added
for the last four months|421534005|258706009
as an alternative.[6]

If tuberculosis recurs,|371569005|246455001
testing|272393004
to
determine
to which antibiotics|255631004
it
is
sensitive|83185005
is
important
before determining treatment.|276239002|416118004

If multiple drug-resistant TB (MDR - TB)|260396001|410942007|30714006
is
detected,|260373001
treatment|276239002|416118004
with
at least four effective antibiotics|276139006|421534005|255403003|255631004|276139006|421534005|254648000|255631004|263796003|421534005|255403003|255631004|263796003|421534005|254648000|255631004
for 18
to 24 months|258706009
is
recommended.[6]

Primary resistance|63161005|30714006|261424001|30714006
occurs|272120004
when
a person|125676002
becomes
infected
with a resistant strain|30714006|48532005|30714006|276768000
of TB.

A person|125676002
with fully susceptible TB|131196009
may
develop
secondary|2603003|81170007
(acquired|255396000
)
resistance|30714006
during therapy|276239002
because of inadequate treatment,|71978007|276239002|71978007|416118004
not
taking|419652001
the prescribed regimen appropriately
(lack|41277001

)
,
or
using|260676000
low-quality medication.|62482003|263496004|410942007|371880002|263496004|410942007

Drug-resistant TB|410942007|30714006
is
a serious public health issue|42745003|310115006|55607006
in many developing countries,|223369002
as
its treatment|276239002|416118004
is
longer|255511005
and
requires
more expensive drugs.|242762006|410942007

MDR-TB
is
defined
as resistance|30714006
to the two most effective first-line TB drugs|420797005|255403003|255216001|50009006|410942007|420797005|255403003|232714002|50009006|410942007|420797005|254648000|255216001|50009006|410942007|420797005|254648000|232714002|50009006|410942007
:
rifampicin|387159009
and
isoniazid.|387472004

Extensively drug-resistant TB|410942007|30714006
is
also resistant|30714006
to three|421291004
or
more
of the six classes|422218008|258391009
of second-line drugs.|81170007|50009006|410942007|257997001|50009006|410942007|288495006|50009006|410942007

Totally drug-resistant TB,|410942007|30714006
which
was
first|255216001|232714002
observed
in 2003
in Italy,|223668000
but
not widely
reported|229059009|223458004
until 2012,
is
resistant|30714006
to all currently used drugs.[77]|15240007|246488008

Progression|246453008|246450006
from TB infection
to overt TB disease|64572001
occurs|272120004
when
the bacilli|44762009|416207009
overcome
the immune system defenses|116003000
and
begin|255395001
to multiply.|421206002

In primary TB disease|56416009
(
some 1?5%|264623001
of cases|398241000|413769002
)
,
this
occurs|272120004
soon
after the initial infection.|884001|232714002

However,
in the majority
of cases,|398241000|413769002
a latent infection|44104002
occurs|272120004
with no obvious symptoms.

These dormant bacilli|44762009|416207009
produce
active tuberculosis|427099000
in 5?10%|264706000|264605009
of these latent cases,|44104002|398241000|44104002|413769002
often many years|70232002|258707000
after infection.[8]

The risk|30207005
of reactivation
increases|260366006
with immunosuppression,|86553008|38013005
such as that
caused|23981006|134198009

thought|88952004
,
[79]
with
estimates|414135002

account
for more

The chance
of death|419620001|268923008
from a case|398241000
of tuberculosis|371569005
is
about 4%
as of 2008,
down
from 8%
in 1995.[6]

Roughly one-third|421379005|70905002
of the world's population|385436007|389109008
has
been
infected
with _M.|258311008

on a global scale.|60132005|19892000|60132005|278111002

However,
most infections

not
cause|23981006|134198009

[82]
and

has
achieved
particularly dramatic progress,|385651009
with an approximate 80% reduction|26175008|58294000|26175008|260400001|26175008|289928003
in its TB mortality rate|409651001
between 1990
and
2010.

Tuberculosis|371569005
is
more common|242762006|72906007
in developing countries|223369002
;
about 80%

Hopes|247798006
of totally
controlling|54776003|31509003
the disease|64572001
have
been
dramatically
dampened
because of a number|410680006|410681005
of factors,
including|55919000
the difficulty|371157007
of developing
an effective vaccine,|255403003|398827000|254648000|398827000
the expensive
and
time-consuming diagnostic process,|410669006|439401001|415178003|410669006|261004008|415178003
the necessity
of many months|258706009
of treatment,|276239002|416118004
the increase|260366006
in HIV-associated tuberculosis,|19030005|47429007|371569005|86406008|47429007|371569005|402916007|47429007|371569005
and
the emergence
of drug-resistant cases|410942007|30714006|398241000|410942007|30714006|413769002
in the 1980s.[6]

In 2007,
the country|223369002
with the highest estimated incidence rate|75540009|414135002|371879000|414135002
of TB
was
Swaziland,|223550008
with 1,200 cases|260305007|398241000|260305007|413769002
per 100,000 people.|125676002

India|223600005
had
the largest total incidence,|255509001|258755000|255509001|255619001|263768009|258755000|263768009|255619001

In developed countries,|223369002
tuberculosis|371569005
is
less common|276139006|72906007|263796003|72906007
and
is
found mainly|404684003
in urban areas.|224807002|42798000

in 2010.

In Canada|223686002
and
Australia,|223621005
tuberculosis|371569005
is
many times|260396001|410669006|260396001|417929005
more common|242762006|72906007
among the aboriginal peoples,|125676002
especially
in remote areas.|5686001|42798000|261007001|42798000

In the United States|223688001
the Aborigines
have
a fivefold greater mortality|263768009|409651001
from TB.[87]

The incidence
of TB
varies
with age.|424144002

In Africa,|223498002
it primarily
affects|4065008
adolescents|133937008
and
young adults.|84422007|133936004

However,
in countries|223369002
where incidence rates
have
declined
dramatically
(
such as the United States|223688001
)
,
TB
is
mainly
a disease|64572001
of older people|70753007|125676002
and
the immunocompromised.[1][89]|370391006

Tuberculosis|371569005
has
been
present|52101004|246105001
in humans|278412004
since
antiquity
at the latest.|260383002

The earliest unambiguous detection|264499004
of _M.|258311008

tuberculosis_|371569005
involves|248448006
evidence|18669006
of the disease|64572001
in the remains
of bison|442982002
dated|410671006
to approximately 17,000 years ago.|26175008|258707000

However,
whether tuberculosis|371569005
originated
in bovines,
then
was
transferred|129347002
to humans,|278412004
or
whether
it
diverged
from a common ancestor,|72906007
is
currently unclear.|15240007

(MTBC
)
in humans|278412004
to MTBC
in animals|387961004
suggests
humans|278412004
did
not
acquire|255396000
MTBC
from animals|387961004
during animal domestication,|387961004
as
was
previously
believed.

Both
strains|48532005|276768000
of the tuberculosis bacteria|371569005|409822003
share
a common ancestor,|72906007
which
could
have
infected humans|278412004
as early|264499004
as the Neolithic Revolution.|257875004

Skeletal remains|113192009
show
prehistoric humans|278412004
(4000 BC
had
TB,
and
researchers
have
found tubercular decay|404684003|69824008|125366008|69824008|125366008
in the spines|421060004

dating|410671006
from 3000?2400 BC.

_Phthisis_|154283005
is
a Greek word|1451003|255373000
for consumption,
an old term|70753007
for pulmonary tuberculosis|154283005
;[94]
around 460 BC,
Hippocrates
identified|7882003
phthisis|154283005
as the most widespread disease|4757001|85333001|64572001
of the times.|410669006|417929005

It
was
said|66049007
to
involve|248448006
fever|386661006
and
the coughing|272039006
up
of blood,|87612001|119273009
which
was
almost always fatal.|399166001

Genetic studies|3950001|110465008|3950001|224699009|255395001|110465008|255395001|224699009
suggest
TB
was
present|52101004|246105001
in the Americas
from about
the year 100 AD.[96]|258707000|259039008

Before the Industrial Revolution,|257875004
folklore
often associated tuberculosis|70232002|47429007|371569005
with vampires.

When
one member|421379005|394852005
of a family|35359004
died|419620001|419099009
from it,
the other infected members|74964007|394852005
would
lose
their health slowly.|263775005|419443000

People|125676002
believed
this
was
caused|23981006|134198009
by the original person|19535007|125676002
with TB
draining|32712000
the life|224130005
from the other family members.[97]|74964007|303071001|260309001|74964007|303071001|264708004

Although
the pulmonary form|39607008|246176004|264164005|246176004
associated|47429007
with tubercles|69824008
was
established|263748003|385645004
as a pathology|394595002
by Dr Richard Morton|309343006
in 1689,
[98][99]
due to the variety
of its symptoms,
TB
was
not
identified|7882003
as a single disease|125681006|64572001|50607009|64572001
until the 1820s,
and
was
not named tuberculosis|27468005|371569005
until 1839
by [J.

L.|258995007|420559008

Sch?nlein]|403967000
(/wiki/Johann_Lukas_Sch%C3%B6nlein|403967000
).

During the years 1838?1845,|258707000
Dr.|309343006

John Croghan,
the owner
of Mammoth Cave,|285067000
brought|68369002
a number|410680006|410681005
of people|125676002
with tuberculosis|371569005
into the cave in
the hope|247798006
of curing
the disease|64572001
with the constant temperature|105723007|246508008
and
purity
of the cave air|285067000|417696007
;
they
died|419620001|419099009
within a year.|258707000|259039008

Hermann Brehmer
opened|56116003
the first TB sanatorium|255216001|232714002
in 1859
in Soko?owsko,
Poland.[102]|223640004

The bacillus causing tuberculosis,|113861009|23981006
_Mycobacterium tuberculosis_,|113861009
was
identified|7882003
and
described
on 24 March 1882
by Robert Koch.

He
received
the Nobel Prize
in physiology|1360005
or
medicine|410942007
in 1905
for this discovery.

Koch
did
not
believe
the bovine|34618005
(cattle
)
and
human tuberculosis diseases|278412004|371569005|64572001
were
similar,
which
delayed
the recognition|312020002
of infected milk|3718001|119321005|70813002
as a source|260753009
of infection.

Later,
the risk|30207005
of transmission|258150004
from this source|260753009
was
dramatically
reduced|260400001
by the invention
of the pasteurization process.|439719009|415178003

Koch
announced
a glycerine extract|80582002|62972009
of the tubercle bacilli
as a "remedy"
for tuberculosis|371569005
in 1890,
calling
it 'tuberculin'.|423321003

While
it
was
not effective,|255403003|254648000
it
was
later successfully
adapted
as a screening test|20135006|269814003|20135006|20135006|272393004
for the presence|386397008
of presymptomatic tuberculosis.[104]|371569005

Albert Calmette
and
Camille Gu?rin
achieved
the first genuine success|255216001|385669000|232714002|385669000
in immunization|127785005
against tuberculosis|371569005
in 1906,
using|260676000
attenuated bovine-strain tuberculosis.|24588000|373437006|48532005|24588000|373437006|276768000

It
was
called
bacillus|44762009|1017006
of Calmette
and
Gu?rin
(BCG
).

The BCG vaccine|418571002
was
first|255216001|232714002
used|394850002
on humans|278412004
in 1921
in France,|223666001
[105]
but
only
received widespread acceptance|85333001
in the USA,|223688001
Great Britain,|223861009
and
Germany|223637004
after
World War II.[106]

Tuberculosis|371569005
caused|23981006|134198009
the most widespread public concern|4757001|85333001
in the 19th
and
early 20th centuries|264499004
as an endemic disease|86820007
of the urban poor.|224807002|11403006|224807002|255351007

In 1815,
one|421379005
in four deaths|421534005|419620001|421534005|268923008
in England|223664003
was
due to "consumption".

By 1918,
one|421379005
in six deaths|422218008|419620001|422218008|268923008
in France|223666001
was
still
caused|23981006|134198009
by TB.

After
determining
the disease|64572001
was
contagious
in the 1880s,
TB
was
put
on a notifiable disease list|64572001
in Britain,
campaigns
were
started|385652002
to
stop|422117008
people|125676002
from spitting|12405001
in public places,|257557008
and
the infected poor|11403006|255351007
were
"
encouraged
" to
enter|417985001
sanatoria
that resembled prisons
(
the sanatoria
for the middle|255562008|399488007
and
upper classes|261183002|258391009
offered|410527000
excellent care|425405005
and
constant medical attention|74188005|6769007
).

Whatever
the
(purported
)
benefits
of the "fresh air"|261013005|417696007
and
labor|289909005|261041009
in the sanatoria,
even
under the best conditions,|260905004
50%
of those
who
entered|417985001
died|419620001|419099009
within five years|421820001|258707000
(_circa_ 1916
).[102]

In Europe,|223502009
rates
of tuberculosis|371569005
began|255395001
to
rise
in the early 1600s|264499004
to a peak level|255587001
in the 1800s,
when
it
caused nearly 25%|23981006|134198009
of all deaths.|419620001|268923008

Mortality then|409651001
decreased nearly 90%|1250004|264705001|1250004|264703008|260400001|264705001|260400001|264703008|260371004|264705001|260371004|264703008
by the 1950s.

Improvements
in public health|310115006
began|255395001
significantly reducing rates|260400001
of tuberculosis even|371569005
before the arrival
of streptomycin|387223008
and
other antibiotics,|74964007|255631004
although
the disease|64572001
remained
a significant threat|386134007
to public health|310115006
such
that
when
the Medical Research Council|74188005
was
formed|35810008
in Britain
in 1913,
its initial focus|884001|87017008|884001|363702006|232714002|87017008|232714002|363702006
was
tuberculosis research.[109]|371569005

In 1946,
the development|278923009
of the antibiotic streptomycin|255631004|387223008
made
effective treatment|255403003|276239002|255403003|416118004|254648000|276239002|254648000|416118004
and
cure
of TB
a reality.

Prior to the introduction|107733003
of this drug,|410942007
the only treatment|50607009|276239002|50607009|416118004|420295001|276239002|420295001|416118004
(
except sanatoria
)
was
surgical intervention,|83578000
including|55919000
the "pneumothorax technique",|36118008|272394005
which
involved|248448006
collapsing|271787007|52071002
an infected lung|39607008|181216001
to "
rest|258157001
"
it
and
allow
tuberculous lesions|371569005
to heal.|298005009

The emergence
of MDR-TB
has
again introduced surgery|127487003|83578000
as an option
within the generally accepted standard|385645004
of care
in treating TB infections.|28995006

Current surgical interventions|15240007|83578000
involve|248448006
removal|118292001|128303001
of pathological chest cavities|394595002|43799004|29458008|43799004
("bullae"|408764000
)
in the lungs to|39607008
reduce|260400001
the number|410680006|410681005
of bacteria|409822003
and
to
increase|260366006
the exposure|71677004|24932003
of the remaining bacteria|409822003
to drugs|410942007
in the bloodstream, thereby simultaneously|79970003
reducing|260400001
the total bacterial load|258755000|409822003|255619001|409822003
and
increasing|260369004
the effectiveness|255403003
of systemic antibiotic therapy.|31099001|281789004

Hopes|247798006
of completely
eliminating
TB
(_cf._ smallpox|67924001|243568000
were
dashed
after the rise
of drug-resistant strains|410942007|30714006|48532005|410942007|30714006|276768000
in the 1980s.

The subsequent resurgence|255260001
of tuberculosis|371569005
resulted|42752001|394617004
in the declaration
of a global health emergency|60132005|263775005|25876001
by the World Health Organization|263775005|21139007
in 1993.[112]

The World Health Organization|263775005|21139007
and
the Bill|27883009
and
Melinda Gates Foundation|418836005
are
subsidizing
a new fast-|7147002|16985007|7147002|277748003
acting
diagnostic test|103693007
for use|277889008|419385000
in low-|62482003|371880002
and
middle-income countries.|255562008|223369002|399488007|223369002

Many resource-poor places|260396001|11403006|257557008|260396001|255351007|257557008
as of 2011 still only
have
access|260507000
to sputum microscopy.[115]|167995008

India|223600005
had
the highest total number|75540009|258755000|410680006|75540009|258755000|410681005|75540009|255619001|410680006|75540009|255619001|410681005|371879000|258755000|410680006|371879000|258755000|410681005|371879000|255619001|410680006|371879000|255619001|410681005
of TB cases worldwide|398241000|413769002
in 2010,
in part|260726005
due to poor disease management|11403006|64572001|413454004|11403006|64572001|119270007|255351007|64572001|413454004|255351007|64572001|119270007
within the private health care sector.|263775005|255505007

Programs
such as the Revised National Tuberculosis Control Program|261560009|371569005|31509003
are
helping
to
reduce|260400001
TB levels|258395000
amongst people|125676002
receiving
public health care.[116][117]|310115006

The BCG vaccine|418571002
has
limitations,|246175000
and
research
to
develop
new TB vaccines|7147002|398827000
is
ongoing.|255238004

A number|410680006|410681005
of potential candidates|30207005
are
currently|15240007
in phase I|21191007|42146005|21191007|22971001
and
II clinical trials.|110465008

Two main approaches|420797005|63161005|420797005|63161005|103379005
are
being
used to|394850002
attempt
to
improve|385425000|3442003|385633008
the efficacy
of available vaccines.|103328004|398827000

One approach|421379005
involves|248448006
adding
a subunit vaccine|398827000
to BCG,
while
the other strategy|74964007
is
attempting
to
create
new|7147002
and
better live vaccines.|3442003|419749002|398827000

MVA85A,
an example
of a subunit vaccine,|398827000
currently|15240007
in trials|110465008
in South Africa,|223549008
is
based|418836005
on a genetically modified vaccinia virus.|13126002|243326001|13126002

Vaccines|398827000
are
hoped
to
play|300776002
a significant role|386134007
in treatment|52101004|276239002|52101004|416118004|18720000|276239002|18720000|416118004
of
both
latent|44104002
and
active disease.[120]|55561003|64572001

To
encourage
further discovery,|46053002
researchers
and
policymakers
are
promoting
new economic models|7147002
of vaccine development,|398827000|278923009
including|55919000
prizes,
tax incentives,
and
advance market commitments.|86005002|284440009

A number|410680006|410681005
of groups,|261586004|160481000
including|55919000
the Stop TB Partnership,|422117008
[123]
the South African Tuberculosis Vaccine Initiative,|413464008|423907008|247756008
and
the Aeras Global TB Vaccine Foundation,|60132005|398827000|60132005|398827000|418836005
are
involved|248448006
with research.

Among these,
the Aeras Global TB Vaccine Foundation|60132005|398827000|60132005|398827000|418836005
received
a gift|221668007
of more|242762006
than $280 million
(
US
)
from the Bill|27883009
and
Melinda Gates Foundation to|418836005
develop
and
license
an improved vaccine|385425000|398827000|3442003|398827000
against tuberculosis|371569005
for use|277889008|419385000
in high burden countries.[125][126]|75540009|223369002|371879000|223369002

Mycobacteria|243368001
infect
many different animals,|263735002|387961004
including|55919000
birds,|387972009
