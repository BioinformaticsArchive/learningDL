*Hemosiderosis|39011001

*
(AmE
or
*
*haemosiderosis|39011001
*
*
(BrE
is
a form|246176004
of iron overload disorder|60737008
resulting|42752001
in the accumulation
of hemosiderin.|70748002

Types|261664005
include|55919000
:

Hemosiderin deposition|7078001
in the lungs|39607008
is
often|70232002
seen
after diffuse alveolar hemorrhage,|73099002
which
occurs|272120004
in diseases|64572001
such as Goodpasture's syndrome,|50581000
Wegener's granulomatosis,|239934006
and
idiopathic pulmonary hemosiderosis.|40527005

Mitral stenosis|79619009|86466006
can
also
lead|88488004
to pulmonary hemosiderosis.|40527005

Hemosiderin collects|70748002
throughout the body|279495008|123037004
in hemochromatosis.|399187006

Hemosiderin deposition|7078001
in the liver|10200004|181268008
is
a common feature|72906007
of hemochromatosis|399187006
and
is
the cause|134198009
of liver failure|59927004
in the disease.|64572001

Deposition|46595003
in the pancreas|15776009|181277001
leads|88488004|236874000
to diabetes|73211009
and
in the skin|119325001|39937001|181469002
leads|88488004|236874000
to hyperpigmentation.|49765009

Hemosiderin deposition|7078001
in the brain|12738006|258335003
is
seen
after bleeds|131148009
from any source,|260753009
including|55919000
chronic subdural hemorrhage,|7003006|54214006|90734009|95453001
Cerebral arteriovenous malformations,|234142008
cavernous hemangiomata.|416824008

Hemosiderin collects|70748002
in the skin|119325001|39937001|181469002
and
is
slowly|419443000
removed|127485006
after bruising|125667009
;
hemosiderin|70748002
may
remain
in some
conditions|78326006|260905004
such as stasis dermatitis.|366362000

Hemosiderin|70748002
in the kidneys|64033007|17373004
have
been
associated|47429007
with marked hemolysis|46998006|418983006|46998006|404227002|46998006|73320003
and
a rare blood disorder|84638005|34093004|103356009|34093004
called
paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria.|1963002

Hemosiderin|70748002
may
deposit|46595003
in diseases|64572001
associated|47429007
with iron overload.|60737008

These diseases|64572001
are
typically diseases|64572001
in which chronic blood loss|7003006
requires
frequent blood transfusions,|70232002
such as sickle cell anemia|417357006
and
thalassemia,|40108008
though
beta thalassemia|65959000
minor|410599005|255606000
has
been
associated|47429007
with hemosiderin|70748002
deposits|46595003
in the liver|10200004|181268008
in those with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease|20401003|197315008|421463005|197315008
independent of any transfusions.[1][2]|303955003|5447007

Treatment|276239002|416118004
for hemosiderin|70748002
focuses|251776000|87017008|363702006
on limiting|255469002
the effects|253861007
of the underlying disease|64572001
leading|236874000
to continued deposition.|255238004|46595003

In hemochromatosis,|399187006
this entails frequent phlebotomy.|70232002|396540005|70232002|367425007

In diseases|64572001
such as Wegener's granulomatosis,|239934006
immune suppression|86553008
is
required.

Limiting blood transfusions|255469002
and
institution|257622000|385437003
of iron chelation therapy|3829006|276239002
when
iron overload|60737008
is
detected|260373001
are
important
when
managing|119270007
sickle-cell anemia|417357006
and
other chronic hemolytic anemias.|90734009|278215000|90734009|73320003|74964007|90734009|61261009

There
are
several methods|261028005|260686004|261028005|272394005
available|103328004
for diagnosing|439401001
and
monitoring hemosiderosis|302805002|39011001
including|55919000
:

Serum ferritin|269821003
is
a low cost, readily available,|62482003|103328004|371880002|103328004
and
minimally invasive method|10179008|260686004|10179008|272394005
for assessing body iron stores.|279495008|264311001|123037004|264311001

However,
the major problem|255603008|55607006
with
using|260676000
it
as
an indicator
of hemosiderosis|39011001
is
that
it
can
be
elevated|75540009
in a range
of other medical conditions|74964007|74188005|260905004
unrelated|262241003
to iron levels|42950004
including|55919000
infection,
inflammation,|257552002
fever,|386661006
liver disease,|235856003
renal disease|90708001
and
cancer.|363346000|372087000

While
liver biopsies|86259008
provide
a direct measure|255589003|246445000|255589003|272391002
of liver iron concentration,|10200004|3829006|82742001|181268008|3829006|82742001
the small sample size|255507004|123038009|277049003
relative|125677006|29920004
to the size|277049003
of the liver|10200004|181268008
can
lead|88488004
to sampling errors|257915005
given|419582001
the heterogeneity
of iron concentration|3829006|82742001
within the liver.|10200004|181268008

Furthermore,
the invasive nature|10179008|277302009
of liver biopsy|86259008
and
the associated risks|47429007|30207005
of complications|116223007
(
which
can
range
from pain,|22253000
haemorrhage,|131148009
gallbladder perforation|25345001
and
other morbidities|74964007
through
to death|419620001|268923008
in approx 1
in 10,000 cases|398241000|413769002
)
prevent
it
being
used|394850002
as a regular monitoring tool.|17854005|302805002|86967005

MRI|113091000
is
emerging
as the method|260686004|272394005
of choice
for measuring liver iron loading|258104002|10200004|3829006|258104002|181268008|3829006|263571004|10200004|3829006|263571004|181268008|3829006
due to the fact
that
it
is
non-invasive, safer|22762002
and
generally
cheaper
to
perform|398166005
than liver biopsy|86259008
;
does
not
suffer
from problems|55607006
with sampling variability|257915005|255372005
;
and
can
be
used|394850002
more frequently|242762006|70232002
than performing liver biopsies.|86259008

For measuring liver iron concentrations,|258104002|10200004|3829006|82742001|258104002|181268008|3829006|82742001|263571004|10200004|3829006|82742001|263571004|181268008|3829006|82742001

(also
known|36692007
as

has
been
