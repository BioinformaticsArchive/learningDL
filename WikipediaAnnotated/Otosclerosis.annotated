*Otosclerosis|11543004
*
*
is
an abnormal growth|263654008
of bone|272673000|3138006|90780006|128530007
near the middle ear.|25342003|181185000

It
can
result|394617004
in hearing loss.[1]|343087000|15188001

This
is
an inherited disease.|32895009

Otosclerosis|11543004
can
result|394617004
in conductive
and/or
sensorineural hearing loss.|60700002

The primary form|63161005|246176004|261424001|246176004
of hearing loss|343087000|15188001
in otosclerosis|11543004
is
conductive hearing loss (CHL)|44057004
whereby
sounds
reach|282679008
the ear drum|42859004
but
are
incompletely
transferred|129347002
via the ossicular chain|41845008
in the middle ear,|25342003|181185000
and
thus partly
fail
to
reach|282679008
the inner ear|302462009|181189006
(cochlea.|80169004|181187008

This usually
will
begin|255395001
in one ear|421379005|117590005|421379005|1910005
but
will
eventually
affect|4065008
both
ears|117590005|1910005
with a variable course.|255372005|288524001

On audiometry,|21727005
the hearing loss|343087000|15188001
is
characteristically low-frequency,|5878004
with higher frequencies|27732004
being
affected later.|247591002|248448006

Sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL)|60700002
has
also
been
noted
in patients|116154003
with otosclerosis|11543004
;
this
is
usually
a high-frequency loss,|27732004
and
usually
manifests|250255003
late|260383002
in the disease.|64572001

The causal link|134198009
between otosclerosis|11543004
and
SNHL
remains
controversial.

Approximately 0.5%|26175008|260316000
of the population|385436007|389109008
will
eventually
be
diagnosed|439401001
with otosclerosis.|11543004

Post mortem studies|168461002|110465008|168461002|224699009
show
that
as
many
as 10%
of people|125676002
may
have
otosclerotic lesions
of their temporal bone,|60911003|181795004
but
apparently never
had
symptoms
warranting
a diagnosis.|439401001

Caucasians|413773004|185984009
are
the most affected race,|4757001|247591002|415229000|4757001|248448006|415229000
with the prevalence
in the Black|315240009|413464008|15086000|371252007
and
Asian populations|414978006|385436007
being
much lower.|242762006|261122009|4757001|261122009

In clinical practice otosclerosis|58147004|11543004
is
encountered about twice|421832002
as
frequently|70232002
in females|248152002
as
in males,|248153007
but
this
does
not
reflect|225436004
the true sex ratio.|31874001|258139002|118586006|31874001|365952006|118586006|31874001|263495000|118586006|31874001|70256003|118586006|31874001|57312000|118586006

When
families|35359004
are
investigated|116698004
it
is
found|404684003
that
the condition|260905004
is
only slightly more common|50607009|425404009|72906007|420295001|425404009|72906007
in women.|224526002

Usually noticeable hearing loss|343087000|15188001
begins|255395001
at middle-age,|28288005
but
can
start|255395001
much sooner.

The hearing loss|343087000|15188001
was
long|255511005
believed to
grow
worse|230993007|390772001|231877006
during pregnancy,|289908002
but
recent research|6493001
does
not
support|9096001|243114000
this belief.[3][4]

The disease|64572001
can
be
considered
to
be
hereditary,|255404009
but
its penetrance|53568006
and
the degree|258395000|246173007
of expression|10012005
is
so highly variable|223528007|75540009|255372005
that
it
may
be
difficult to|52925006
detect|260373001
an inheritance pattern.|246071007|272135003

Most
of the implicated genes|67271001
are
transmitted|60117003|258150004
in an autosomal dominant fashion.|263681008

One genome-wide analysis|421379005|18470003|90522003|272389005
associates|47429007
otosclerosis|11543004
with variation|40885006
in RELN gene.[5]|67271001

The pathophysiology|386585008
of otosclerosis|11543004
is
complex.|103360007

The key lesions|417490005
of otosclerosis|11543004
are
multifocal areas|524008|42798000
of sclerosis|43846000
within the endochondral temporal bone.|60911003|181795004

These lesions
share
some characteristics
with Paget?s Disease,|2089002
but
they
are
not
thought|88952004
to
be
otherwise
related.|272151006|262094002

Histopathologic studies|394597005
have
all
been
done
on cadaveric temporal bones,|60911003
so
only inferences|50607009|420295001
can
be
made
about progression|246453008|246450006
of the disease histologically.|64572001|67151002

It
seems
that
the lesions
go
through an active ?spongiotic?|55561003|6609001
/ hypervascular phase|21191007
before
developing
into ?sclerotic? phase lesions.|43846000|21191007|255444002|21191007

There
have
been
many genes|260396001|67271001
and
proteins|88878007
identified|7882003
that,
when
mutated|55446002
,
may
lead|88488004
to these lesions.

Also there
is
mounting|246143003
evidence|18669006
that measles virus|52584002
is
present|52101004|246105001
within the otosclerotic foci,|87017008
implicating
an infectious etiology|134198009
(
this
has
also
been
noted
in Paget?s Disease|2089002
).

CHL|28724005
in otosclerosis|11543004
is
caused|23981006|134198009
by two main sites|420797005|63161005|10546003
of involvement|248448006
of the sclerotic|43846000|255444002
(
or
scar-|70582006|275322007
like
)
lesions.

The best understood mechanism|20572008|66216009|257544000|3442003|66216009|257544000
is
fixation|1431002
of the stapes|22718006|264199009
footplate|59498008
to the oval window|3931001
of the cochlea.|80169004|181187008

This greatly
impairs|260379002|40226000
movement|255324009
of the stapes|22718006|264199009
and
therefore transmission|258150004
of sound|68325009
into the inner ear|302462009|181189006
(?ossicular coupling?
).

Additionally
the cochlea?s round window|28784008
can
also
become
sclerotic,|43846000|255444002
and
in a similar way
impair|260379002|40226000
movement|255324009
of sound pressure|279046003|13543005|257893003|68325009|279046003|68325009|13543005|68325009|257893003
waves
through the inner ear|302462009|181189006
(?acoustic coupling?|68325009
).

SNHL
in otosclerosis|11543004
is
controversial.

Over the past century,|410513005
leading|236874000
otologists
and
neurotologic researchers
have
argued
whether
the finding|404684003
of SNHL late|260383002
in the course|288524001
of otosclerosis|11543004
is
due to otosclerosis|11543004
or
simply
to typical presbycusis.|49526009

There
are
certainly
a few well documented instances|57176003|20572008|397934002
of sclerotic lesions directly|43846000|255444002
obliterating
sensory structures|272646001
within the cochlea|80169004|181187008
and
spiral ligament,|14596009
which
have
been
photographed|257444003
and
reported|229059009|223458004
post-mortem.|168461002

Other supporting data|74964007|9096001|74964007|243114000
includes|55919000
a consistent loss|385433004
of cochlear hair cells|52148002
in patients|116154003
with otosclerosis|11543004
;
these cells|4421005
being
the chief sensory organs|244485009
of sound reception.|68325009

A suggested mechanism|257544000
for this
is
the release|58000006|68776005|258760001|129299003|115956009
of hydrolytic enzymes|90668006
into the inner ear|302462009|181189006
structures
by the spongiotic lesions.|6609001

Otosclerosis|11543004
is
traditionally
diagnosed|439401001
by characteristic clinical findings,|404684003
which
include|55919000
progressive conductive hearing loss,|255314001|44057004
a normal tympanic membrane,|17621005|42859004|17621005|181180005|258744000|42859004|258744000|181180005
and
no evidence|18669006
of middle ear inflammation.|65363002

The cochlear promontory|80169004
may
have
a faint pink tinge|271594007|371243003
reflecting|225436004
the vascularity|59820001
of the lesion,
referred|439980006
to
as
the Schwartze sign.|72670004

Conductive hearing loss|44057004
is
usually secondary|2603003|81170007
to impingement
of abnormal bone|263654008|272673000|263654008|3138006|263654008|90780006|263654008|128530007
on the stapes|22718006|264199009
footplate.|59498008

This involvement|248448006
of the oval window|3931001
forms|246176004
the basis|418836005
of the name fenestral otosclerosis.|11543004

The most common location|4757001|72906007|246267002
of involvement|248448006
of otosclerosis|11543004
is
the bone|272673000|3138006|90780006|128530007
just anterior|255549009
to the oval window|3931001
at a small cleft|255507004|9094003
known|36692007
as the fissula ante fenestram.|272113006

The fissula
is
a thin fold|18043004|26310004
of connective tissue extending|181769001|255590007
through the endochondral layer,
approximately|26175008
between the oval window|3931001
and
the cochleariform process,|415178003
where
the tensor tympani tendon|245054002
turns|282987006
laterally
toward the malleus.|4639008|34080009|264090005

Imaging|363679005|278395004
is
usually
not
pursued
in those with uncomplicated conductive hearing loss|20401003|263914008|44057004|421463005|263914008|44057004
and
characteristic clinical findings.|404684003

Those with only conductive hearing loss|20401003|44057004|421463005|44057004
are
often|70232002
treated medically|28995006
or
with surgery|83578000
without imaging.|363679005|278395004

The diagnosis|439401001
may
be
unclear clinically
in cases|398241000|413769002
of sensorineural
or
mixed hearing loss|77507001
and
may
become
apparent only
on imaging.|363679005|278395004

Therefore,
imaging|363679005|278395004
is
often|70232002
performed|398166005
when
the hearing loss|343087000|15188001
is
sensorineural
or
mixed.|26242008

The mechanism|257544000
of sensorineural hearing loss|60700002
in otosclerosis|11543004
is
less well understood.|276139006|20572008|66216009|263796003|20572008|66216009

It
may
result|394617004
from direct injury|255589003
to the cochlea|80169004|181187008
and
spiral ligament|14596009
from the lytic process|371757000|415178003|255308008|415178003
or
from release|58000006|68776005|258760001|129299003|115956009
of proteolytic enzymes|130202003
into the cochlea.|80169004|181187008

A high-resolution CT|75540009|371879000
shows
very subtle bone findings.|260358002|118953000

However,
CT
is
usually
not
needed|410525008|103325001
prior to surgery.|83578000

Otosclerosis|11543004
on CT
can
be
graded|258349007|371469007
using|260676000
the grading system|384739005
suggested
by Symons
and
Fanning.|261259003

Grade 1,
solely fenestral
;
grade 2,|258349007|371469007
patchy|10027005
localized cochlear disease|74217003|80169004
(
with
or
without fenestral involvement|248448006
)
to
either
the basal cochlear turn|57195005|80169004|282987006
(grade 2A|258349007|371469007
)
,
or
the middle/apical turns|255562008|43674008|282987006|399488007|43674008|282987006
(grade 2B|258349007|264663000|371469007|264663000
)
,
or
both the basal turn|57195005|282987006
and
the middle/apical turns|255562008|43674008|282987006|399488007|43674008|282987006
(grade 2C|258349007|371469007
)
;
and
grade 3,|263843001
diffuse confluent cochlear involvement|19648000|74832004|80169004|248448006
(
with
or
without fenestral involvement|248448006
).

Treatment|276239002|416118004
of otosclerosis|11543004
relies
on two primary options|420797005|63161005|420797005|261424001
:
hearing aids|6012004
(more recently|242762006|6493001
including|55919000
bone-conduction hearing aids|16476001|62479008
)
and
a surgery|83578000
called
a stapedectomy.|69130005

Hearing aids|6012004
are
usually very effective early|260358002|255403003|264499004|260358002|254648000|264499004
in the course|288524001
of the disease,|64572001
but
eventually
a stapedectomy|69130005
(
or
more frequently|242762006|70232002
a variant|40885006
called
the stapedotomy|232190000
)
may
be
required
for definitive treatment.|261002007|276239002|261002007|416118004

Early attempts|264499004
at hearing restoration|47078008|260938008|118230007|260938008
via the simple freeing|13673007|37837009
the stapes|22718006|264199009
from its sclerotic attachments|43846000|1431002|255444002|1431002
to the oval window|3931001
were
met|229057006
with temporary improvement|14803004
in hearing,|47078008|118230007
but
the conductive hearing loss|44057004
would
almost always recur.|246455001

A stapedectomy|69130005
consists
of removing|127485006
a portion|260726005
of the sclerotic stapes|43846000|22718006|43846000|264199009|255444002|22718006|255444002|264199009
footplate|59498008
and
replacing|370124000
it
with an implant|40388003|71861002|64218007
that
is
secured
to the incus.|35395007|272649008

This procedure|71388002
restores
continuity|277052006
of ossicular movement|255324009
and
allows
transmission|258150004
of sound waves
from the eardrum|42859004
to the inner ear.|302462009|181189006

A modern variant|40885006
of this surgery|83578000
called
a stapedotomy,|232190000
is
performed|398166005
by drilling|80342005
a small hole|255507004
in the stapes|22718006|264199009
footplate|59498008
with a micro-drill|19851009|389183007
or
a laser,|122456005|38586004
and
the insertion|71861002|257867005
of a piston-like prothesis.|257313008

The success rate|385669000
of
either
surgery|83578000
depends
greatly
on the skill
and
the familiarity|36692007
with the procedure|71388002
of the surgeon.|304292004

However,
comparisons
have
shown
stapedotomy to|232190000
yield
results|394617004
at least
as good|20572008
as stapedectomy,|69130005
with fewer complications,|57176003|116223007
and
thus stapedotomy|232190000
is
preferred|225773000
under normal circumstances.[7]|17621005|258744000

Other less successful treatments|74964007|182985004
involve|248448006
pharmaceuticals|421967003
or
orally ingested supplements.|260548002|111984006|373453009

One|421379005
is
fluoride administration,|372639009|413454004|372639009|416118004
which theoretically
becomes
incorporated
into bone|272673000|3138006|90780006|128530007
and
inhibits|61511001
otosclerotic progression.|246453008|246450006

This treatment|276239002|416118004
cannot
reverse
conductive hearing loss,|44057004
but
may
slow|419443000
the progression|246453008|246450006
of both
the conductive
and
sensorineural components|246093002
of the disease process.|64572001|415178003

Otoflour
is
one|421379005
such widely used medicine,|394850002|410942007
comprising
sodium fluoride.|6910009

Recently,|6493001
some success|385669000
has
been
claimed
with a second|81170007|257997001|288495006
such treatment,|276239002|416118004
bisphosphonate medications|372907000|410942007
that
inhibit|61511001
bone destruction.|272673000|64597002|3138006|64597002|90780006|64597002|128530007|64597002

However,
these early reports|264499004|229059009|264499004|223458004
are
based|418836005
on non-randomized case studies|398241000|110465008|398241000|224699009
that
do
not
meet|229057006
standards
of clinical trials.|110465008

There
are
numerous side-effects|260396001
to
both
pharmaceutical treatments,|421967003|276239002
including|55919000
occasional stomach upset,|84638005|162059005
allergic itching,|424492005
and
increased joint pains|35105006|57676002|260366006|57676002
which
can
lead|88488004
to arthritis.|3723001

In the worst case,|556001|398241000|367391008|398241000|230993007|398241000|390772001|398241000|231877006|398241000
bisphosphonates|372907000
may
lead|88488004
to osteonecrosis|240196003|398199007
of the auditory canal|84301002
itself.

Finally,
neither
approach
has
been
proven|277025001
to
be
beneficial
after the commonly preferred method|225773000|260686004|225773000|272394005
of surgery|83578000
has
been
undertaken.

theorized
to
suffer
from otosclerosis,|11543004

this
is
controversial.

Victorian journalist Harriet Martineau gradually|308004006
lost
her hearing|47078008|118230007
during her young life,|84422007|224130005
and
later medical historians|74188005|78826004
have
diagnosed|439401001
her
with probably
suffering
from otosclerosis|11543004
as well.|20572008

Howard Hughes
the pioneering American aviator,
engineer,|106269003
industrialist,
and
film producer also
suffered
from otosclerosis.|11543004

Frankie Valli,
lead|88488004
singer|14831008
of The Four Seasons,|421534005|21864008
