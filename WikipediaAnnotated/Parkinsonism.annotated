hypokinesia,|255385008
rigidity,|16046003
and
postural instability.|35799003|410728007

The underlying causes|134198009
of parkinsonism|32798002
are
numerous,|260396001
and
diagnosis|439401001
can
be
complex.|103360007

While
the neurodegenerative condition Parkinson's disease|260905004|49049000
(PD|49049000|60022001
)
is
the most common cause|4757001|72906007|134198009
of parkinsonism,|32798002
a wide-range|90522003
of other etiologies|74964007|134198009
may
lead|88488004
to a similar set
of symptoms,
including|55919000
some toxins,|80917008
a few metabolic diseases,|57176003|30390004
and
a handful
of non-PD neurological conditions.|49049000|1199008|260905004|60022001|1199008|260905004

Its most common cause|4757001|72906007|134198009
is
as a side effect
of medications,|410942007
mainly neuroleptic antipsychotics especially|372482001|372482001
the phenothiazines|372839006|26562001|373207000
(
such as perphenazine|387229007
and
chlorpromazine,|387258005
thioxanthenes
(
such as flupenthixol|387567006
and
zuclopenthixol|429346008
)
and
butyrophenones|273961005
(
such as haloperidol (Haldol)|386837002|25104002

,
piperazines|373220002
