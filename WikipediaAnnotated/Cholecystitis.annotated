*Cholecystitis|76581006
*
*
is
inflammation|257552002
of the gall bladder.|28231008|181269000

Cholecystitis usually|76581006
presents|52101004|246105001
as a pain|22253000
in the right upper quadrant.|255497008

This
is
known|36692007
as biliary colic.|37389005

This
is
initially intermittent,|884001|7087005
but
later usually
presents|52101004|246105001
as a constant,
severe pain.|76948002

During the initial stages,|884001|261612004|232714002|261612004
the pain|22253000
may
be
felt|285854004
in an area totally|42798000
separate|263869007
from the site|10546003
of pathology,|394595002
known|36692007
as referred pain.|6617009

The pain|22253000
is
originally
located
in the right upper quadrant|255497008
but
the referred pain|6617009
may
occur|272120004
in the right scapula region|24028007|182345000
(Boas' sign.|22433002|72670004

This
may
also
present|52101004|246105001
with the above mentioned pain|22253000
after eating greasy|48263008|13524005
or
fatty foods|228012005
such as pastries,|226749001
pies,|367542003
and
fried foods.|227282006|255620007

This
is
usually
accompanied
by a low-grade fever,|304213008
diarrhea,|398032003
vomiting|249497008
,
nausea|422587007
and
granulocytosis.|317226009

The gallbladder|28231008|181269000
may
be
tender|300820003
and
distended.|255381004

More severe symptoms|242762006|162470006
such as high fever,|75540009|386661006|371879000|386661006
shock|27942005
and
jaundice|18165001
indicate|410535002
the development|278923009
of complications|116223007
such as abscess formation,|128477000|11798007|128477000|255277001
perforation|263837003
or
ascending cholangitis.|26918003

Another complication,|116223007|263718001
gallstone ileus,|37976006
occurs|272120004
if
the gallbladder perforates|28231008|263837003|181269000|263837003
and
forms|246176004
a fistula|428794004|418743005
with the nearby small bowel,|264196002
leading|236874000
to symptoms
of intestinal obstruction.|81060008

Chronic cholecystitis|20824003
manifests|250255003
with non-specific symptoms|10003008
such as nausea,|422587007
vague abdominal pain,|25615006|21522001
belching|275299008
,
and
diarrhea.|398032003

Cholecystitis|76581006
is
often|70232002
caused|23981006|134198009
by cholelithiasis|266474003
(
the presence|386397008
of choleliths,|256896000
or
gallstones,|266474003|256896000|235919008
in the gallbladder|28231008|181269000
)
,
with choleliths most commonly|256896000
blocking|2899008|112232007
the cystic duct directly.|77452001|245398005

This
leads|88488004|236874000
to inspissation|47927003
(thickening|263899003
)
of bile,|70150004
bile stasis,|33688009
and
secondary infection|264569006
by gut organisms,|122865005|410653004
predominantly _[E.

coli]
(/wiki/E._coli|112283007
)
_
and
_Bacteroides_ species._[citation|57522007|131218001
needed|410525008|103325001
_]

The gallbladder's wall|28231008|224727009|181269000|224727009
becomes
inflamed.

Extreme cases|12565001|398241000|12565001|413769002
may
result|394617004
in necrosis|6574001
and
rupture.|415747007

Inflammation often|257552002|70232002
spreads|410677005
to its outer covering,|261074009|255334000
thus
irritating
surrounding structures|355648006
such as the diaphragm|263734003|336704008|181614006
and
bowel.|261093006

Less commonly,|276139006|263796003
in debilitated
and
trauma patients,|116154003|116154003
the gallbladder|28231008|181269000
may
become
inflamed
and
infected
in the absence|2667000|418560003
of cholelithiasis,|266474003
and
is
known|36692007
as acute acalculous cholecystitis.|34346002

This
can
arise|68727004
in patients|116154003
with anorexia nervosa,|56882008
as
the lack|41277001
of stimulation|122545008
of the gallbladder|28231008|181269000
leads|88488004|236874000
to an infectious process.|441862004

Stones|384600008
in the gallbladder|28231008|181269000
may
cause|23981006|134198009
obstruction|26036001
and
the accompanying acute attack.|272118002|217315002|272118002|216299002

The patient|116154003
might
develop
a chronic, low-level inflammation|84499006|62482003|258395000|84499006|62482003|276625007|84499006|371880002|258395000|84499006|371880002|276625007
which
leads|88488004|236874000
to a chronic cholecystitis,|20824003
where
the gallbladder|28231008|181269000
is
fibrotic|263756000
and
calcified.

Cholecystitis|76581006
is
usually
diagnosed|439401001
by a history|392521001
of the above symptoms,|261183002
as well as
examination findings|271906008
:

Subsequent laboratory|255260001|261904005
and
imaging tests|363679005|269814003|363679005|272393004|278395004|269814003|278395004|272393004
are
used|394850002
to
confirm|59156000
the diagnosis|439401001
and
exclude|77765009
other possible causes.|74964007|371930009|134198009|74964007|60022001|134198009

Ultrasound|359659005
can
assist|116697009|119265000
in the differential.[1][2]|263735002

This
should
be
suspected|415684004
whenever
there
is
acute right upper quadrant|272118002|255497008
or
epigastric pain,|79922009
other possible causes|74964007|371930009|134198009|74964007|60022001|134198009
include|55919000
:

The symptoms
of chronic cholecystitis|20824003
are
non-specific, thus chronic cholecystitis|10003008|20824003
may
be
mistaken
for other common disorders|74964007|72906007|64572001
:

Cholangitis|82403002
is
a medical emergency|74188005|25876001
as
it
may
be
life threatening|224130005
and
patients|116154003
can
rapidly|418694008
succumb
to acute liver failure|235884008
or
bacterial sepsis.|10001005

The classical sign|255333006|72670004|260997001|72670004
of cholangitis|82403002
is
Charcot's triad,
which
is
right upper quadrant pain,|301717006
fever|386661006
and
jaundice.|18165001

Liver function tests|26958001
will
likely|2931005
show
increases|260366006
across all enzymes|90668006
(AST,
ALT,|56935002
ALP,
GGT
)
with raised bilirubin.|26165005

As
with choledocholithiasis,
diagnosis|439401001
is
confirmed|59156000
using|260676000
cholangiopancreatography.

_
It
is
worth noting
that bile|70150004
is
an extremely favorable growth medium|421955000
for bacteria,|409822003
and
infections
in this space
develop
rapidly|418694008
and
may
become
quite severe.__[citation|24484000
needed|410525008|103325001
_]

Laboratory values|261904005
may
be
notable
for an elevated alkaline phosphatase,|274770006
possibly|60022001
an elevated bilirubin|26165005
(
although
this
may
indicate|410535002
choledocholithiasis,
and
possibly|60022001
an elevation|103720008|255456001
of the WBC count.|767002

CRP|128200000
(C-reactive protein|61425002|55235003
)
is
often|70232002
elevated.|75540009

The degree|258395000|246173007
of elevation|103720008|255456001
of these laboratory values|261904005
may
depend
on the degree|258395000|246173007
of inflammation|257552002
of the gallbladder.|28231008|181269000

Patients|116154003
with acute cholecystitis|65275009
are
much more likely to|242762006|2931005|4757001|2931005
manifest|250255003
abnormal laboratory values,|263654008|261904005
while
in chronic cholecystitis|20824003
the laboratory values|261904005
are
frequently normal.|70232002|17621005|70232002|258744000

Sonography|359659005
is
a sensitive|83185005
and
specific modality|69658003
for diagnosis|439401001
of acute cholecystitis|65275009
;
adjusted sensitivity and specificity|410617001|35209006|69658003|410617001|365705006|69658003
for diagnosis|439401001
of acute cholecystitis|65275009
are
88%
and
80%,
respectively.

The diagnostic criteria|439401001|261004008
are
gallbladder wall thickening|28231008|224727009|263899003|181269000|224727009|263899003
greater|263768009
than 3mm,
pericholecystic fluid|32457005|33463005|255765007
and
sonographic Murphy's sign.|359659005|53566005

Gallstones|266474003|256896000|235919008
are
not part|260726005
of the diagnostic criteria|439401001|261004008
as acute cholecystitis|65275009
may
occur|272120004
with
or
without them.

The reported sensitivity and specificity|229059009|35209006|69658003|229059009|365705006|69658003|223458004|35209006|69658003|223458004|365705006|69658003
of CT scan findings|77477000|404684003|77477000
are
in the range
of 90?95%.|264705001|264703008

CT
is
more sensitive|242762006|83185005
than ultrasonography|359659005
in the depiction
of pericholecystic inflammatory response
and
in localizing pericholecystic abscesses,|255471002|84233008
pericholecystic gas,|308698004|74947009
and
calculi|384600008
outside the lumen|113342003|342806003|398252006
of the gallbladder.|28231008|181269000

CT
cannot
see|281004000
noncalcified gallbladder calculi,|17589002|235919008
and
cannot
assess
for a Murphy's sign.|53566005

Hepatobiliary scintigraphy|373205008
with technetium-99m DISIDA|72454006
(bilirubin analog|79706000
is
also sensitive|83185005
and
accurate|263656005
for diagnosis|439401001
of chronic|90734009
and
acute cholecystitis.|65275009

It
can
also
assess
the ability|371150009
of the gall bladder|28231008|181269000
to expel bile|70150004
(gall bladder ejection fraction|28231008|34205009|278277004|181269000|34205009|278277004
)
,
and
low gall bladder ejection fraction|62482003|28231008|34205009|278277004|62482003|181269000|34205009|278277004|371880002|28231008|34205009|278277004|371880002|181269000|34205009|278277004
has
been
linked
to chronic cholecystitis.|20824003

However,
since
most patients|116154003
with right upper quadrant pain|301717006
do
not
have
cholecystitis,|76581006
primary evaluation|63161005|63161005|386053000|261424001|261424001|386053000
is
usually
accomplished
with a modality
that
can
diagnose|439401001
other causes,|74964007|134198009
as well.|20572008

For most patients|116154003
diagnosed|439401001
with acute cholecystitis,|65275009
the definitive treatment|261002007|276239002|261002007|416118004
is
surgical removal|118292001|128303001|128304007
of the gallbladder,|28231008|181269000
cholecystectomy.|38102005

Until the late 1980s surgical removal|260383002|118292001|260383002|128303001|260383002|128304007
was
usually
accomplished
by a large incision|255509001|34896006
in the upper right quadrant|255497008
of the abdomen|277112006|52731004|302553009
under the rib cage.|60413009

Since
the advent
of laparoscopic surgery|108191006|83578000|83578000
in the early 1990s,|264499004
laparoscopic cholecystectomy|45595009
has
become
the treatment|276239002|416118004
of choice
for acute cholecystitis.|65275009

Laparoscopic cholecystectomy|45595009
is
performed|398166005
using|260676000
several small incisions|261028005|255507004|34896006
located
at various points|256220008
across the abdomen.|277112006|52731004|302553009

Several studies|261028005|110465008|261028005|224699009
have
demonstrated
the superiority|261183002
of laparoscopic cholecystectomy|45595009
when
compared
to open cholecystectomy.|56116003|38102005

Patient|116154003
undergoing
laparoscopic surgery|108191006|83578000|83578000
report|229059009|223458004
less incisional pain postoperatively|276139006|34896006|22253000|263796003|34896006|22253000
as well as
having
fewer long term complications|57176003|116223007
and
less disability|276139006|21134002|263796003|21134002
following|255260001
the surgery.|83578000

Additionally,
laparoscopic surgery|108191006|83578000|83578000
is
associated|47429007
with a lower rate|261122009
of surgical site infection.[7]|433202001

During the days|258703001
prior to laparoscopic surgery,|108191006|83578000|83578000
studies|110465008|224699009
showed
that outcomes|394617004
were
better|3442003
following|255260001
early removal|264499004|118292001|264499004|128303001
of the gallbladder,|28231008|181269000
preferably
within the first week.|255216001|258705008|255216001|259038000|232714002|258705008|232714002|259038000

Patients|116154003
receiving
early intervention|423637002
had
shorter hospital stays|359530003|359530003|285201006|367450005|367450005|285201006
and
lower complication rates.|261122009|116223007|261122009|263718001

In the era
of laparoscopic surgery,|108191006|83578000|83578000
a similar approach
is
still
advocated.

In a 2006 Cochrane review,
early laparoscopic cholecystectomy|264499004|45595009
was
compared
to delayed treatment.|276239002|416118004

The review
consisted
of 5 trials|264706000|110465008|264605009|110465008
with 451 patients|116154003
randomized
to
either
early|264499004
(223 patients|116154003
)
or
delayed
(228
)
surgical management.|83578000|413454004|83578000|119270007

There
was
no statistically significant difference|386134007|263735002
in terms
of negative outcomes|260385009|394617004
including|55919000
bile duct injury|127313006
(
OR
0.63,
95% CI 0.15
to 2.70|260306008
)
or
conversion to open cholecystectomy|272148004|56116003|38102005
(
OR
0.84,
95% CI 0.53
to 1.34|260305007
).

However,
the early group|264499004|261586004|264499004|160481000|264499004|389109008
was
found|404684003

For early cholecystectomy,|264499004|38102005
the most common reason|4757001|72906007|410666004
for conversion to open surgery|272148004|129236007
is
inflammation obscuring Calot's triangle.|257552002|27237009

For delayed surgery,|83578000
the most common reason|4757001|72906007|410666004
was
fibrotic adhesions.[9]|263756000|42685002

Supportive measures|246445000|367346004
are
usually
instituted|385437003
prior to surgery.|83578000

These measures|246445000|367346004
include|55919000
fluid resuscitation
and
antibiotics.|255631004

Antibiotic regimens usually|255631004
consist
of a broad spectrum antibiotic|90522003|255631004
such as piperacillin-tazobactam|346628003
(Zosyn
)
,
ampicillin-sulbactam|398786001
(Unasyn
)
,
ticarcillin-clavulanate|372577006
(Timentin
)
,
or
a cephalosporin|373262009
(
e.g.
ceftriaxone|372670001
and
an antibacterial|419241000
with good coverage|20572008
(fluoroquinolone
such as ciprofloxacin|392412000
and
anaerobic bacteria coverage,|59343002
such as metronidazole.|372602008

For penicillin allergic patients,|373270004|116154003|116154003
aztreonam|387386004
and
clindamycin|372786004
may
be
used.|394850002

In cases|398241000|413769002
of severe inflammation,|103624008
shock,|27942005
or
if
the patient|116154003
has
higher risk|15508007
for general anesthesia|50697003
(
required
for cholecystectomy,|38102005
the managing physician|119270007|309343006
may
elect
to
have
an interventional radiologist|225334002|66862007
insert|257867005|421532009
a percutaneous drainage catheter|103388001|307488001|19923001|103388001|122462000|19923001
into the gallbladder|28231008|181269000
('percutaneous cholecystostomy tube'|174525001|83059008
)
and
treat|395077000
the patient|116154003
with antibiotics|255631004
until the acute inflammation resolves.|4532008

A cholecystectomy|38102005
may
then
be
warranted
if
the patient's condition|116154003|260905004
improves.|385425000|3442003|385633008

Gall bladder perforation (GBP)|25345001
is
a rare|84638005|103356009
but
life-threatening complication|224130005|116223007|224130005|263718001
of acute cholecystitis.|65275009

The early diagnosis|264499004|439401001|264499004
and
treatment|276239002|416118004
of GBP
are
crucial to
decrease|260400001|260370003
patient morbidity|116154003
and
mortality.|409651001

Approaches|103379005
to this complication|116223007|263718001
will
vary
based|418836005
on the condition|260905004
of an individual patient,|125676002|116154003|385435006|116154003
the evaluation|386053000
of the treating surgeon|28995006|304292004
or
physician,|309343006
and
the facilities' capability.

Perforation|263837003
can
happen
at the neck|45048000|302550007
from pressure necrosis|420226006
due to the impacted calculus,|134293005|384600008
or
at the fundus.|65784005|414003|87009000|27485007

It
can
result|394617004
in a local abscess,|255470001|128477000
or
perforation|263837003
into the general peritoneal cavity.|60132005|181616008|60132005|83670000

If
the bile|70150004
is
infected,
diffuse peritonitis|19648000|48661000
may
occur|272120004
readily
and
rapidly|418694008
and
may
result|394617004
in death|419620001|268923008
A retrospective study|110465008|224699009
looked|386548000
at 332 patients|116154003
who
received
medical|74188005
and/or
surgical treatment|83578000
with the diagnosis|439401001
of acute cholecystitis.|65275009

Patients|116154003
were
treated|28995006
with analgesics|373265006
and
antibiotics|255631004
within the first 36 hours|255216001|258702006|232714002|258702006
after admission|32485007
(
with a mean|255586005
of 9 hours|258702006
)
,
and
proceeded
to surgery|83578000
for a cholecystectomy.|38102005

Two patients|420797005|116154003
died|419620001|419099009
and
6 patients|116154003
had
further complications.|46053002|116223007

The morbidity
and
mortality rates|409651001
were
37.5%
and
12.5%,
respectively
in the present study.|52101004|110465008|52101004|224699009|246105001|110465008|246105001|224699009

The authors|308004006
of this study|110465008|224699009
suggests
that early diagnosis|264499004|439401001|264499004
and
emergency surgical treatment|182813001|83578000|25876001|83578000
of gallbladder perforation|25345001
are
of crucial importance.[10]

Xanthogranulomatous cholecystitis (XGC)|76581006
is
a rare form|84638005|246176004|103356009|246176004
of gallbladder disease|39621005
which
mimics
gallbladder cancer|363353009|372140005
although
it
is
not cancerous.|363346000|372087000

It
was
first|255216001|232714002
discovered
and
reported|229059009|223458004
in the medical literature|74188005
in 1976
by J.J.

McCoy,
Jr.,
and
colleagues.[11][13]
