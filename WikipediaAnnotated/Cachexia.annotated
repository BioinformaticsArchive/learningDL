muscle atrophy,|88092000
fatigue,|84229001
weakness,|13791008|260407003

The formal definition|246176004
of cachexia|238108007
is
the loss
of body mass|279495008|300848003|279495008|118538004|123037004|300848003|123037004|118538004
that
cannot
be
reversed
nutritionally
:
Even
if
the affected patient eats more calories,|103309006|48263008|258790008
lean body mass|248362003
will
be
lost
,
indicating|410535002
a primary pathology|63161005|394595002|261424001|394595002
is
in place.|257557008|421066005

Cachexia|238108007
is
seen
in patients|116154003
with cancer,|363346000|372087000
AIDS,|62479008
[2] chronic obstructive lung disease,|260306008|413846005
multiple sclerosis,|24700007
congestive heart failure,|42343007
tuberculosis,|371569005
familial amyloid polyneuropathy,|42295001
mercury poisoning|85180002
(acrodynia|66695004
)
and
hormonal deficiency.|278994005|260372006|278994005|248325000

It
is
a positive risk factor|258758003|80943009|10828004|80943009
for death,|419620001|268923008
meaning|255586005
if
the patient|116154003
has
cachexia,|238108007
the chance
of death|419620001|268923008
from the underlying condition|260905004
is
increased dramatically.|35105006|260366006

It
can
be
a sign|72670004
of various underlying disorders|256220008|64572001
;
when
a patient|116154003
presents|52101004|246105001
with cachexia,|238108007
a doctor|309343006
will
generally
consider
the possibility
of cancer,|363346000|372087000
metabolic acidosis|59455009
(
from decreased protein synthesis|1250004|88878007|11798007|260400001|88878007|11798007|260371004|88878007|11798007
and
increased protein catabolism,|35105006|88878007|40091007|260366006|88878007|40091007
certain infectious diseases|17162000|191415002
(
e.g.
,
tuberculosis,|371569005
AIDS|62479008
)
,
chronic pancreatitis,|234689009|68072000
and
some autoimmune disorders,|85828009
or
addiction|32709003
to amphetamine.|373338002

Cachexia physically weakens patients|238108007|116154003
to a state|398070004
of immobility stemming|102491009
from loss
of appetite,|33911006
asthenia,|13791008
and
anemia,|271737000
and
response
to standard treatment|276239002|416118004
is
usually poor.[3][4]|11403006|255351007

Cachexia|238108007
is
often|70232002
seen
in end-stage cancer,|42796001|363346000|42796001|372087000
and
in
that context|263491009
is
called "cancer cachexia".|363346000|238108007|372087000|238108007

Patients|116154003
with congestive heart failure|42343007
can
have
a cachectic syndrome.|238108007

Also,
a cachexia comorbidity|238108007
is
seen
in patients|116154003
who
have
any
of the range
of illnesses|39104002
classified|73504009
as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease,|413846005
particularly emphysema.|49158009|87433001

In each
of these settings,
full-body wasting|261015003|279495008|261015003|123037004
occurs|272120004
,
which
affects|4065008
especially
the skeletal muscle,|127954009|244716004
resulting|42752001
in muscle atrophy.|88092000

However,
when
presenting|246105001
comorbidly
with malabsorption syndrome,|32230006
(
as
seen,
for example,
in Crohn's disease|34000006
or
celiac disease|396331005
)
,
simply
consuming
more food|242762006|255620007
is
not sufficient to|51117008
reverse
wasting
and
the malabsorption|32230006
must
be
treated|28995006
before the patient|116154003
will
be
able to|371150009
stabilize|409051000
body mass.[5]|279495008|300848003|279495008|118538004|123037004|300848003|123037004|118538004

The exact mechanism|257544000
in which
these diseases|64572001
cause|23981006|134198009
cachexia|238108007
is
poorly|556001
understood,|66216009
but
there
is
probably
a role
for inflammatory cytokines,|75777003
such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha|8612007
(
which
is
also
nicknamed
'cachexin'
or
'cachectin'|8612007
)
,
interferon gamma|420303002
and
interleukin 6,|30965005|22766004
as well as
the tumor-secreted proteolysis-inducing factor.|108369006|16404004

Related malnutrition syndromes|272151006|248325000|262094002|248325000
are
kwashiorkor|58262005
and
marasmus,|29740003
although
these
do
not always
have
an underlying causative illness|39104002
;
they
are
most often symptomatic|4757001|70232002|264931009
of severe malnutrition.

Those suffering
from the eating disorder anorexia nervosa|72366004|56882008
appear
to
have
high plasma levels|75540009|419185008|258395000|371879000|419185008|258395000
of ghrelin.|414340004

Ghrelin levels|414340004|258395000
are
also high|75540009|371879000
in patients|116154003
who
have
cancer-induced cachexia.[6]|363346000|16404004|238108007|372087000|16404004|238108007

Currently,|15240007
no widely accepted drugs to|385645004|410942007
treat|395077000
cachexia|238108007
and
no FDA-approved drugs to|9571008|410942007

cancer cachexia|363346000|238108007|372087000|238108007
are
available.|103328004

Cachexia|238108007
may
be
treated|28995006
by steroids,|116566001
such as corticosteroids,|79440004
or
drugs|410942007
that
mimic
progesterone,|16683002
which
increase|260366006
appetite,|33911006
may
reverse
weight loss,|89362005
but
have
no evidence|18669006
of reversing muscle loss.|91727004

Medical marijuana|74188005|74188005|398705004|74188005|228998006|74188005|10083006
has
been
allowed
for the treatment|276239002|416118004
of cachexia|238108007
in some
US states,|398070004

A 2007 systematic review|415300000
of n-3 fatty acids|226365003
and
cachexia|238108007
found|404684003
17 studies,|110465008|224699009
eight|421825006
of which
were
high-quality.|75540009|263496004|371879000|263496004

It
concluded there
was
evidence|18669006
of oral n-3 fatty acid supplements|31979005
benefiting
cancer patients,|363346000|116154003|372087000|116154003
improving|385633008
appetite,|33911006
weight|27113001|272102008|39857003

A 2009 trial|110465008
found|404684003
a supplement|373453009
of eicosapentaenoic acid|226367006
helped
cancer patients|363346000|116154003|372087000|116154003
retain|397909002
muscle mass.[10]|271696003

Three phase-2 clinical presentations|421291004|272110009|58147004|246105001

at ASCO 2010,
with these results|394617004
:
ALD518
is
a humanized anti-IL-6 antibody.|30965005|68498002|30965005|112133008

In testing,|272393004
124 patients|116154003
with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)|86005002|254637007
were
randomized
to one|421379005
of four treatment groups|421534005|276239002|261586004|421534005|276239002|160481000|421534005|416118004|261586004|421534005|416118004|160481000
(about 30
per group|261586004|160481000|389109008
).

Researchers
concluded
the ALD518
given|419582001
to patients|116154003
with NSCLC|254637007
was
safe
and
well tolerated.|20572008

ALD518
improved|385425000|3442003
the lung symptom score,|39607008|278061009|181216001|278061009
reversed fatigue,|84229001
and
less loss|276139006|263796003
of lean body mass|248362003
occurred|272120004
(-0.19 kg|223574006|258683005

on placebo
).[11]

GTx-024
is
a selective androgen receptor modulator (SARM).|65407002

In testing,|272393004
159 patients|116154003
with
either
NSCLC,|254637007
colorectal cancer,|264267007|363346000|264267007|372087000
non-Hodgkin's lymphoma,|118601006
chronic lymphocytic leukemia|51092000
or
breast cancer|254837009|254838004
were
randomized
to oral GTx-024|260548002
(3 mg|260313008|427264006
or
1 mg|260305007|427264006
)
or
placebo daily|69620002
for 16 weeks.|258705008

As a result,|394617004
a statistically significant increase|386134007|260366006
in lean body mass (LBM)|248362003
was
observed
in
both
treatment groups|276239002|261586004|276239002|160481000|416118004|261586004|416118004|160481000

etodolac.|386860005

In testing,|272393004
37 patients|116154003
with advanced NSCLC|86005002|254637007
were
randomized
to one|421379005

(about 12
per group|261586004|160481000|389109008
).

Researchers
observed
a statistically significant difference|386134007|263735002
in the proportion|8212001
of subjects
who
responded
with an improvement
of ? 5%|264706000|264605009

In a study|110465008|224699009
published
in 2010,
researchers
demonstrated
a link
between cachexia|238108007
and
activin|30145004
and
myostatin activity,|48761009|55561003|258745004|257733005
and
successfully
reversed
the effects|253861007
in mice,|447612001|447482001
by inhibiting|61511001
that activity|48761009|55561003|258745004|257733005
through treatment|276239002|416118004
with a soluble version|22303008

According to the 2007 AHRQ National Inpatient sample,|416800000|123038009
in a projected 129,164 hospital encounters|285201006
in the United States,|223688001
cachexia|238108007
was
listed
as
at least
one|421379005
of
up to 14 listed diagnosis codes,|439401001
based|418836005
on a sample|123038009
of 26,325 unweighted encounters.

The CDC National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey,|255327002|74188005
a sample|123038009
of US outpatient visits|373864002
listed
no visits
where cachexia|238108007
was
listed
as one|421379005
of
up to three recorded diagnoses|421291004|439401001
treated|28995006
during the visit,
out of a sample|123038009
of 32,778 unweighted visits.[17]

from cachexia.|238108007

Those with upper gastrointestinal|20401003|127868003|421463005|127868003
and
pancreatic cancers|363418001
have
the highest frequency|27732004
of developing
a cachexic symptom.|238108007

This figure
rises
to 80%
in terminal cancer patients.|42796001|363346000|116154003|42796001|372087000|116154003

In addition|260364009
to increasing morbidity|260369004
and
mortality,|409651001
aggravating|162473008
the side effects
of chemotherapy,|416608005|367336001
and
reducing quality|260400001|263496004
of life,|224130005
cachexia|238108007
is
considered
the immediate cause|88694003|23981006|88694003|134198009|49499008|23981006|49499008|134198009
of death|419620001|268923008
of a large proportion|255509001|8212001
of cancer patients,|363346000|116154003|372087000|116154003
ranging
from 22%
to 40%|259031006
of the patients.[19]|116154003

Symptoms
of cancer cachexia|363346000|238108007|372087000|238108007
include|55919000
progressive weight loss|89362005
and
depletion|69251000
of host
reserves
of adipose tissue|38888009
and
skeletal muscle.|127954009|244716004

Cachexia|238108007
should
be
suspected|415684004
if involuntary weight loss|89362005
of greater|263768009
than 5%|264706000|264605009
of premorbid weight|27113001|272102008|39857003
occurs|272120004
within a six-month period.|422218008|258706009|259037005|422218008|259036001|259037005

Traditional treatment approaches,|263901007|276239002|263901007|276239002|103379005|263901007|416118004|263901007|416118004|103379005
such as appetite stimulants,|33911006|373333006
5-HT3 antagonists,|264706000|272850005|58516001|264605009|272850005|58516001
nutrient supplementation,|373453009
and
COX-2 inhibitor,|387050005
have
failed
to
demonstrate
success|385669000
in reversing
the metabolic abnormalities|276654001
seen
in cancer cachexia.[20]|363346000|238108007|372087000|238108007

Much research
is
currently|15240007
focused|87017008|363702006
on determining
the mechanism|257544000
of the development|278923009
of cachexia.|238108007

The two main theories|420797005|63161005
of the development|278923009
of cancer cachexia|363346000|238108007|372087000|238108007
are
:

Although
the pathogenesis|303109001
of cancer cachexia|363346000|238108007|372087000|238108007
is
poorly|556001
understood,|66216009
multiple biologic pathways|260396001|12893009
are
known|36692007
to
be
involved|248448006
,
including|55919000
proinflammatory cytokines|75777003
such as TNF-alpha,|8612007
neuroendocrine hormones,|87568004
IGF-1,|5699003
and
tumor-specific factors|108369006|69658003
such as proteolysis-inducing factor.|16404004

The in?ammatory cytokines|52101004|75777003|18720000|75777003
involved|248448006
in wasting diseases|288517002
are
interleukin 6,|30965005|22766004
TNF-alpha,|8612007
IL1B,|116722001|50762005
and
interferon-gamma.|420303002

Although
many different tissues|263735002|85756007
and
cell types|4421005|246238003
may
be
responsible|394851003
for the increase|260366006
in circulating cytokines|65929005|75777003
during some types|261664005
of cancer,|363346000|372087000
evidence|18669006
indicates|410535002
the tumors|108369006
are
an important source.|260753009

Cytokines|75777003
by themselves
are
capable
of inducing weight loss.|16404004|89362005

TNF-alpha|8612007
has
been
shown
to
have
direct catabolic effect|255589003|40091007|253861007
on skeletal muscle|127954009|244716004
and
adipose tissue|38888009
and
produces
muscle atrophy|88092000
through the ubiquitin?proteasome proteolytic pathway.|32969006|130755008

The mechanism|257544000
involves|248448006
the formation|11798007|255277001
of reactive oxygen species|11214006|24099007|69658003
leading|236874000
to upregulation
of the transcription factor NF-?B.|10589004|259787006

NF-?B is
a known regulator|36692007
of the genes|67271001
that
encode
cytokines,|75777003
and
cytokine receptors.|75777003|116647005

The increased production|35105006|260366006
of cytokines|75777003
induces|16404004
proteolysis
and
breakdown|40091007|125366008
of myofibrillar proteins.[20]|88878007

Only limited treatment options|50607009|255469002|276239002|50607009|255469002|416118004|420295001|255469002|276239002|420295001|255469002|416118004
exist
for patients|116154003
with clinical cancer cachexia.|58147004|363346000|238108007|58147004|372087000|238108007

Current strategy|15240007
is
to
improve|385425000|3442003|385633008
appetite|33911006
by
using|260676000
appetite stimulants to|33911006|373333006
ensure
adequate intake|51117008|88323005
of nutrients.|226355009

Pharmacological interventions|56183000|225334002
with appetite stimulants,|33911006|373333006
nutrient supplementation,|373453009
5-HT3 antagonists|264706000|272850005|58516001|264605009|272850005|58516001
and
Cox-2 inhibitor|387050005
have
been
used|394850002
to
treat|395077000
cancer cachexia,|363346000|238108007|372087000|238108007
but
with limited effect.|255469002|253861007

Recent studies|6493001|110465008|6493001|224699009
using|260676000
a more|242762006
calorie-|258790008
dense|255596001
(1.5 kcals/ml|264623001|258791007|259035002|264623001|258790008|259035002
)
and
higher protein supplementation|75540009|373687007|371879000|373687007
have
suggested
at least weight stabilization|276139006|27113001|115979005|276139006|272102008|115979005|276139006|39857003|115979005|263796003|27113001|115979005|263796003|272102008|115979005|263796003|39857003|115979005
can
be
achieved
,
although
improvements
in lean body mass|248362003
have
not
been
observed
in these studies.[20]|110465008|224699009

Therapeutic strategies|262202000
have
been
based|418836005
on
either
blocking cytokines synthesis|2899008|75777003|11798007|112232007|75777003|11798007
or
their action.|129264002

Thalidomide|404878004
has
been
demonstrated
to
suppress|245780008
TNF-alpha production|8612007
in monocytes _|55918008|67776007
in vitro_
and
to
normalize
elevated TNF-alpha levels _|75540009|8612007|258395000
in vivo_.

A recent randomized, placebo-controlled trial|6493001|31509003|110465008
in patients|116154003
with cancer cachexia|363346000|238108007|372087000|238108007
showed
the drug|410942007
was
well tolerated|20572008
and
effective|255403003|254648000
at attenuating loss|24588000
of weight|27113001|272102008|39857003
and
LBM
in patients|116154003
with advanced pancreatic cancer.|86005002|372142002|86005002|363418001

An improvement
in the LBM
and
improved quality|385425000|263496004|3442003|263496004
of life|224130005
were
also
observed
in a randomized, double-blind trial|1305003|110465008|1305003|110465008
using|260676000
a protein|88878007
and
energy-dense, omega-3 fatty acids-enriched oral supplement,|248272003|255596001|226365003
provided
its consumption
was
equal|9726003
or
superior|261183002
to 2.2 g|260306008|258795003
of eicosapentaenoic acid|226367006
per day.|258703001|259032004

It
is
also
through decreasing TNF-alpha production.|260371004|8612007

However,
recent data|6493001
arising|68727004
from a large, multicenter,|255509001

EPA administration|413454004|416118004

not successful|385669000
in the treatment|276239002|416118004
of weight loss|89362005
in patients|116154003
with advanced gastrointestinal|86005002

lung cancer.[22]|363358000

Peripheral muscle proteolysis,|14414005|91727004
as
it
occurs|272120004
in cancer cachexia,|363346000|238108007|372087000|238108007
serves
to
mobilize|183376001|302044006
amino acids|52518006
required
for the synthesis|11798007
of liver|10200004|181268008
and
tumor protein.|108369006|88878007

Therefore,
the administration|413454004|416118004
of exogenous amino acids|261074009|52518006|51352008|52518006
may
theoretically
serve
as a protein-|88878007
sparing
metabolic fuel|223373004
by providing substrates
for
both
muscle metabolism|91727004|47722004
and
gluconeogenesis.

Recent studies|6493001|110465008|6493001|224699009
have
demonstrated dietary supplementation|41829006
with a specific combination|69658003|89780004
