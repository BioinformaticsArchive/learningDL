*Aerophagia|30693006

(var.

*
*aerophagy|30693006

)
is
a condition|260905004
that
occurs|272120004
when
a person|125676002
swallows|107160003|288937009
too
much air,|417696007
which
goes
to the stomach.|69695003|181246003

It
causes|134198009
abdominal bloating|248490000
and
frequent belching|70232002|275299008
and
may
cause|23981006|134198009
pain.|22253000

Aerophagia|30693006
is
associated|47429007
with chewing gum,|385063000
smoking|365981007
,
drinking|160573003|30953006
carbonated drinks,|226479007
eating|48263008
too fast,|16985007|277748003
CPAP air pressure|229309006|285400005
(
if
it's
too high|75540009|371879000
)
and
wearing loose dentures.|78799005|8060009

In people|125676002
with cervical spinal blockages,|261064006
inhaling|14910006
can
cause|23981006|134198009
air to|417696007
enter|417985001
the esophagus|32849002|181245004
and
stomach.[1]|69695003|181246003

Aerophagia|30693006
is
diagnosed|439401001
in 8.8%
of cognitively delayed patients[2]|116154003
where the coordination|85352007
between swallowing|54731003|288937009
and
respiration|258162000
is
not well defined.|260409000

In one case,|421379005|398241000
aerophagia|30693006
was
successfully
treated|28995006
with thorazine,|387479008
an antipsychotic sometimes|372482001
used|394850002
to
treat|395077000
hiccups.[4]|65958008

Aerophagia|30693006
is
a dangerous side effect
of noninvasive ventilation (NIV),|428311008
commonly
used|394850002
in treatments|276239002
of respiratory problems|258162000|55607006|449071006|55607006
and
cardiovascular critical care|113257007|133903000
or
in surgery|83578000
when
a general anaesthetic|50697003|373288007
is
required.

In the case|398241000
of aerophagia|30693006
during NIV,
it
is
normally
diagnosed|439401001
by experienced medical specialists|74188005|309395003
who
check|360160009
on patients intermittently|116154003
during NIV use.|277889008|419385000

The diagnosis|439401001
is
based|418836005
on the sound heard|47078008|118230007|68325009|47078008|68325009|118230007
by listening|37931006
through a stethoscope|53639001
placed|257557008|421066005
outside the abdominal cavity.|52731004|361294009

Using|260676000
this approach,
the problem|55607006
is
sometimes
detected|260373001
later|260383002
than
when
it
develops
,
possibly also later|60022001|260383002
than necessary.

Belated detection
of aerophagia|30693006
may
lead|88488004
to gastric distension,|69695003|25322007|264010009|25322007
which in turn|282987006
could
inflate
the diaphragm|263734003|336704008|181614006
or
cause aspiration|134198009|14910006|134198009|278847003|134198009|129316008|134198009|68052005
of the stomach contents|62059006
into the lungs[5]|39607008
or
pneumatic rupture|415747007
of the oesophagus|32849002|181245004
due to extreme gastric insufflation.[6]|12565001|69695003|68641000|12565001|264010009|68641000

Aerophagia|30693006
may
also
refer|439980006
to an unusual condition|260905004
where the primary symptom|63161005|261424001
is
excessive flatus,|80301007
belching|275299008
is
not
present|52101004|246105001
,
and
the actual mechanism|257544000
by which air|417696007
enters|417985001
the gut|122865005
is
obscure.[7]
