is
a serious infectious disease|42745003|191415002
caused|23981006|134198009
by the bacterium _Francisella tularensis_.|409822003|51526001

A Gram-negative, nonmotile coccobacillus,|53932007
the bacterium|409822003
has
several subspecies|261028005
with varying degrees|246173007
of virulence.

The most important|4757001
of those
is
_F.|372639009

tularensis tularensis_
(Type A|261664005
)
,
which
is
found|404684003
in lagomorphs|106950004
(rabbits|88818001
and
similar animals|387961004
)
in North America,|223503004
and
it
is
highly virulent|75540009
in humans|278412004
and
domestic rabbits.|88818001

_F.|372639009

tularensis palaearctica_
(Type B|261664005
)
occurs|272120004
mainly
in aquatic rodents|388077003
(beavers,|392585008
muskrats|384658008
in North America|223503004
and
in hares|1464002
and
small rodents|255507004|388077003
in northern Eurasia.

It
is
less virulent|276139006|263796003
for humans|278412004
and
rabbits.|88818001

The primary vectors|63161005|260529001|261424001|260529001
are
ticks|106831000
and
deer flies,|29901001|106790007
but
the disease|64572001
can
also
be
spread|410677005
through other arthropods.|74964007|106762008

The disease|64572001
is
named|27468005
after Tulare County,
California.|224043007|25997004

Depending
on the site|10546003
of infection,
tularemia|19265001
has
six characteristic clinical symptoms|422218008|58147004
:
ulceroglandular
(
the most common type|4757001|72906007|261664005
representing
75%
of all forms|246176004
)
,
glandular,|255286006|362884007
oropharyngeal,|31389004
pneumonic,|39607008|181216001
oculoglandular,
and
typhoidal.[5]|4834000|396441007

The incubation period|406646006
for tularemia|19265001
is
one|421379005
to 14 days|258703001
;
most human infections|278412004
become
apparent
after three to five days.|421291004|421820001|258703001

In most susceptible mammals,|131196009|387976007
the clinical signs|58147004|72670004
include|55919000
fever,|386661006
lethargy,|214264003
anorexia,
signs|72670004
of septicemia,|105592009
and
possibly death.|60022001|419620001|60022001|268923008

Nonhuman mammals rarely|387976007|103356009
develop
the skin lesions|95324001
seen
in people.|125676002

Subclinical infections|28456004
are
common,|72906007
and
animals often|387961004|70232002
develop
specific antibodies|404263002
to the organism.|410653004

Fever|386661006
is
moderate|6736007
or
very high,|260360000
and
tularemia bacilli|19265001|44762009|19265001|416207009
can
be
isolated|46651001
from blood|87612001|119273009
cultures|252398009|61594008
at this stage.|21191007|371508000|261612004

The face|89545001|302549007
and
eyes|81745001
redden
and
become
inflamed.

Inflammation|257552002
spreads|410677005
to the lymph nodes,|59441001
which enlarge|260376009|118452000
and
may
suppurate
(
mimicking
bubonic plague|50797007
).

Lymph node involvement|59441001|248448006|181756000|248448006
is
accompanied
by a high fever.|75540009|386661006|371879000|386661006

Death|419620001|268923008
occurs|272120004
in less|276139006|263796003
than 1%|260305007
if
therapy|276239002
is
initiated promptly.

The microbiologist|159138004
must
be
informed|410938009|223458004
when
tularemia|19265001
is
suspected because _F.|372639009|415684004|372639009

tularensis_
requires
special media|67995009|61695000
for cultivation
such as buffered charcoal and yeast extract (BCYE).|58296003|62972009|412534006|62972009|411818003|62972009

It
cannot
be
isolated|46651001
in the routine culture media|50811001|421955000
because of the need|410525008|103325001
for sulfhydryl group donors|115582009
(
such as cysteine|5932006
).

Serological tests|68793005
(detection
of antibodies|68498002
in the serum|67922002
of the patients|116154003
)
are
available|103328004
and
widely
used.|394850002

Cross reactivity|65145006|11214006
with _Brucella_|26250004
can
confuse|286933003
interpretation|280452008
of the results,|394617004
so
diagnosis|439401001
should
not
rely
only
on serology.|68793005

Molecular methods|290005005|260686004|290005005|272394005
such as PCR|258066000|103338009
are
available|103328004
in reference laboratories.|415259005

The bacteria|409822003
can
penetrate|53568006
into the body|279495008|123037004
through damaged skin|37782003|119325001|37782003|39937001|37782003|181469002
and
mucous membranes,|313268005
or
through inhalation.|14910006|422237004

Humans|278412004
are
most often|4757001|70232002
infected
by tick bite|409983009
or
through handling
an infected animal.|387961004

Ingesting infected water,|111984006|11713004|111984006|119318008
soil,|415555003
or
food|255620007
can
also
cause|23981006|134198009
infection.

Tularemia|19265001
can
also
be
acquired|255396000
by inhalation|14910006|422237004
;
hunters
are
at a higher risk|15508007
for this disease|64572001
because of the potential|30207005
of inhaling|14910006
the bacteria|409822003
during the skinning process.|119325001|415178003|39937001|415178003|181469002|415178003

It
has
been
contracted|78558002
from inhaling particles|14910006
from an infected rabbit|88818001
ground|15537006
up
in a lawnmower|85590000
(
see|281004000
below
).

Tularemia|19265001
is
not
spread|410677005
directly
from person|125676002
to person._[citation|125676002

_Francisella tularensis_|51526001
is
an intracellular bacterium,|83167003|409822003
meaning|255586005
it
is
able to|371150009
live|419749002
as a parasite|37763007
within host cells.|4421005

It primarily
infects
macrophages,|58986001
a type|261664005
of white blood cell,|52501007
thus
is
able to|371150009
evade
the immune system.|116003000

The course|288524001
of disease|64572001
involves|248448006
the
spread|410677005
of the organism|410653004
to multiple organ systems,|260396001|91689009
including|55919000
the lungs,|39607008
liver,|10200004|181268008
spleen,|78961009|181279003
and
lymphatic system.|89890002

The course|288524001
of disease|64572001
is
different|263735002
depending
on the route|284009009
of exposure.|71677004|24932003

Mortality|409651001
in untreated|25265005
(
before the antibiotic era|255631004
)
patients|116154003
has
been
as
high|75540009|371879000
as 50%
in the pneumoniac
and
typhoidal forms|4834000|246176004|396441007|246176004
of the disease,|64572001
which however
account
for less|276139006|263796003
than 10%
of cases.|398241000|413769002

Overall mortality|409651001
was
7%
for untreated cases,|25265005|398241000|25265005|413769002
and
the disease|64572001
responds
well|20572008
to antibiotics,|255631004
with a fatality rate|399166001
of about 1%.

The exact cause|134198009
of death|419620001|268923008
is
unclear,
but
it
is
thought to|88952004
be
a combination|89780004
of multiple organ system failures.|57653000

The drug|410942007
of choice
is
streptomycin.|387223008

Tularemia|19265001
may
also
be
treated|28995006
with gentamicin|387321007|411310000
for ten days,|23067006|258703001|420258001|258703001
tetracycline-class drugs|372809001|258391009|410942007|16355005|258391009|410942007|282831004|258391009|410942007
such as doxycycline|372478003
for two|420797005
to three weeks,|421291004|258705008
[9] chloramphenicol,|372777009
or
fluoroquinolones.

An attenuated, live vaccine|24588000|419749002|398827000
is
available,|103328004
but
its use|277889008|419385000
is
only
for high risk groups.|15508007|261586004|15508007|160481000

Its use|277889008|419385000
as postexposure prophylaxis|409516001
is
not
recommended.

The disease|64572001
is
endemic
in North America,|223503004
and
parts|260726005
of Europe|223502009
and
Asia.|223500001

The most common mode|4757001|72906007
of transmission|258150004
is
via arthropod vectors.|106762008|260529001

Ticks|106831000
involved|248448006
include|55919000
_Amblyomma_,|47181001
_Dermacentor_,|70372009
_Haemaphysalis_,|84129009
and
_Ixodes_.|27524005

Rodents,|388077003
rabbits,|88818001
and
hares|1464002
often|70232002
serve
as reservoir hosts,|257687008
[11]
but
waterborne infection
accounts
for 5|264706000|264605009
to 10%
of all tularemia|19265001
in the
US.

Tularemia|19265001
can
also
be
transmitted|60117003|258150004
by biting flies,|283345006
particularly
the deer fly _Chrysops discalis_.|106790007|18587003

Individual flies|125676002|367378007|385435006|367378007
can
remain
infective
for 14 days|258703001
and
ticks|106831000
for over two years.|21481007|420797005|258707000

Tularemia|19265001
may
also
be
spread|410677005
by direct contact|255589003|11723008|255589003|70862002
with contaminated animals|62604006|387961004
or
material,|260769002
by ingestion|111984006
of poorly cooked flesh|556001|106373003
of infected animals|387961004
or
contaminated water,|102414000
or
by inhalation._[citation|14910006|422237004

_]

In the United States,|223688001
although
records
show
that tularemia|19265001
was
never particularly common, incidence rates|72906007
continued|255238004
to
drop|404218003
over the course|288524001
of the 20th century,
so|223528007
between 1990
and
2000,
the rate
was
less
than 1|260305007
per 1,000,000,|260305007
meaning|255586005
the disease|64572001
is
extremely rare|84638005|103356009
in the
US today.[13]

_F.|372639009

tularensis_
has
been
identified|7882003
as the cause|134198009
of human outbreaks|278412004|443684005
in ancient Canaan
in about 1715 BC
and
in 1075 BC.

A long-|255511005
lasting
epidemic
that
plagued|58750007
the eastern Mediterranean
in the 14th century BC
was
also
traced|260405006
back
to a focus|87017008|363702006
in Canaan
along the Arwad-Euphrates
trading
route.|284009009

According to Siro I.|42146005|22971001

Trevisanato,
this epidemic
contaminated|62604006
an area|42798000
stretching|122546009
from Cyprus|223649003
to Iraq,|223608003
and
from Palestine
to Syria,|223617003
sparing
Egypt|223511009
(
due to a quarantine|170499009
)
and
Anatolia
(
owing to effective political boundaries|255403003|254648000
).

Subsequently,
wars
are
believed
to
have
spread|410677005
the same disease|262126009|64572001
into central Anatolia,|26216008
from
whence
it
was
deliberately
introduced|127487003
into western Anatolia,
in acts
constituting
the first known record|255216001|36692007|232714002|36692007
of biological warfare.|12893009

Finally,
Aegean soldiers
fighting|248005005
in western Anatolia
returned|7528007
home|261770009
to their Greek islands,|223819003
further|46053002
spreading|410677005
the same epidemic.|262126009

The tularemia bacterium|19265001|409822003
was
first|255216001|232714002
isolated|46651001
by G.W.|258795003

McCoy
of the [U.S.|223688001

)
plague lab|58750007|261904005
and
reported|229059009|223458004
in 1912.

Scientists|308027003
determined
tularemia|19265001
could
be
dangerous
to humans|278412004
;
a human|278412004
being
may
catch|30623001
the infection
after contacting|11723008
an infected animal.|387961004

The ailment soon|39104002
became
associated|47429007
with hunters,
cooks|106373003
and
agricultural workers.[18]|106541005

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|26216008|64572001|31509003|169443000
(CDC
)
regard _F.|372639009

tularensis_
as a viable biological warfare agent,|263927007
and
it
has
been
included|55919000
in the biological warfare programs|12893009
of the United States,|223688001
Soviet Union
and
Japan|223583001
at various times.|256220008|410669006|256220008|417929005

A former Soviet biological weapons|9130008
scientist|308027003
,
Kenneth Alibek,
has
alleged
that
an outbreak|443684005
of tularemia|19265001
among German soldiers shortly|7695005
before the siege
of Stalingrad
was
due to the release|58000006|68776005|258760001|129299003|115956009
of _F.|372639009

tularensis_
by Soviet forces.

Others|74964007
who
have
studied|110465008|224699009
the pathogen "|264418008
propose
that
an outbreak|443684005
resulting|42752001
from natural causes|510009|134198009
is
more likely".|242762006|2931005

In the
US,
practical research
into
using|260676000
rabbit fever|19265001
as a biological warfare agent
took|419652001
place|257557008|421066005
in 1954
at Pine Bluff Arsenal,|45793000
Arkansas,|224042002
an extension|255536004
of the Camp Detrick program.

It
was
viewed|246516004
as an attractive agent because|260872001
:

The Schu S4 strain|48532005|276768000
was
standardized
as "Agent UL"|260872001|420167005

in the United States M143|223688001
bursting|255331008
spherical bomblet.|34258004

It
was
a lethal biological warfare agent
with an anticipated fatality rate|399166001
of 40 ? 60%.|259031006

The rate-

The aerobiological stability|58158008
of UL|420167005
was
a major concern,|255603008
being
sensitive|83185005

From May
to October 2000,
an outbreak|443684005
of tularemia|19265001
in Martha's Vineyard
resulted|42752001|394617004
in one fatality,|421379005|399166001
and
brought|68369002
the interest|225469004
of the CDC
as a potential investigative ground|30207005
for aerosolized _Francisella tularensis_.|51526001

Over the following summers,|255260001
Martha's Vineyard
was
identified|7882003
as the only|50607009|420295001
place|257557008|421066005
in the world
where
documented|397934002
cases|398241000|413769002
of tularemia|19265001
resulted|42752001|394617004
from lawn mowing.[25]

An outbreak|443684005
of tularemia|19265001
occurred|272120004
in Kosovo
in 1999-2000.[26]

In 2004,
three researchers|421291004
at Boston University Medical Center|405608006
were
accidentally
infected
with _F.|372639009

tularensis_,
after
apparently
failing
to
follow|367409002|421939007
safety procedures.[27]|370886002

In 2005,
small amounts|255507004|107651007
of _F.|372639009

tularensis_
were
detected|260373001
in the Mall area|42798000
of Washington,|421908005
DC
the morning|73775008
after an antiwar demonstration
on September 24,
2005.

Biohazard sensors|409595003|408746007
were
triggered|410658008
at six locations|422218008|246267002
surrounding|355648006
the Mall.

While
thousands
of people|125676002
were
potentially
exposed|24932003
,
no infections
were
reported.|229059009|223458004

The detected bacteria likely|260373001|409822003|2931005
originated
from a natural source,|510009|260753009
not
from a bioterror attempt.[28]

Tularemia|19265001
is
endemic
in the Gori region|410673009
of the Eurasian country|223369002
of Georgia.|278873008|223375006

The last outbreak|443684005
was
in 2006.[29]

In July 2007,
an outbreak|443684005
was
reported|229059009|223458004
in the Spanish autonomous region|72167002|410673009
of Castile
and
Le?n|276137008
and
traced|260405006
to the plague|58750007
of voles|384655006
infesting
the region.|410673009

Another outbreak|443684005
had
taken|419652001
place|257557008|421066005
ten years before|23067006|258707000|420258001|258707000
in the same area.[30]|262126009|42798000

In August 2009,
a Swedish tourist
was
bitten|3404009|25272006
by an unidentified insect|69910005|106763003
at Point Grey, Vancouver,|229029004|371253002
BC,
Canada.|223686002

It
was
not
until
after
return|7528007
to Sweden|223681007
that
he
was
diagnosed|439401001
with tularemia,|19265001
despite
seeking
medical treatment|74188005|276239002|74188005|416118004
in Vancouver._[citation

In Jan 2011,
researchers
searching
for brucellosis|75702008
among feral hog populations|385436007
in Texas discovered widespread tularemia infection|421662006|85333001|19265001
or
evidence|18669006
of past infection|410513005
in feral hog populations|385436007
of
at least 2 Texas counties[31],|276139006|421662006|264664006|263796003|421662006|264664006
even
though
tularemia|19265001
is
not normally
associated|47429007
with pigs|106996007|78678003
at all.

Precautions
were
recommended
for those
who hunt,
dress,|228204008
or
prepare
feral hogs.

Since
feral hogs
roam
over large distances,|255509001|246132006
there
is
concern
that tularemia|19265001
may
spread|410677005
or
already
be
present|52101004|246105001
in feral hogs
over a very wide geographic area.|260358002|90522003|42798000

In June 2011,
in Armenia,|223645009
Mrgahovit village|224806006

In November 2011,
it
was
found|404684003
in Tasmania,|223780000
Australia.|223621005

Reports|229059009|223458004
claimed
it to
be
the first|255216001|232714002
in the southern hemisphere.

However,
the causative organism|410653004
was
documented|397934002
to
have
been
isolated|46651001
from a foot wound|56459004|13924000|259051005|13924000|302545001|13924000
