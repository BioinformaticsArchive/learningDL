*Listeriosis|4241002
*
*
is
a bacterial infection|301811001
caused|23981006|134198009
by a Gram-positive, motile bacterium,|8745002
_Listeria monocytogenes_.|36094007

Listeriosis|4241002
occurs|272120004
primarily
in newborn infants,|133933007
elderly patients,|105436006|116154003
and
patients|116154003
who
are
immunocompromised.|370391006

Listeriosis kills|4241002|248007002
at least 1|276139006|263796003
in 5 persons|264706000|125676002|264605009|125676002
it infects.

Its wide range|90522003
of temperature tolerance|105723007|228432001|105723007|77472006|105723007|71412006|246508008|228432001|246508008|77472006|246508008|71412006
necessitates
extra care
in food processing|255620007|415178003
and
storage.|48122007|440276004

Meat|28647000
and
dairy products|226760005
must
be
handled
carefully to
prevent
contamination
and
growth
of the pathogen.|264418008

Vegetables|22836000
and
fruit|72511004
that
have
contacted|11723008|70862002
the soil|415555003
must
be
carefully
washed
before refrigeration.

The symptoms
of listeriosis usually|4241002
last
7?10 days,|258703001
with the most common symptoms|4757001|72906007
being
fever,|386661006
muscle aches,|68962001
and
vomiting.|249497008

Diarrhea|398032003
is
another,
but
less common symptom.|276139006|72906007|263796003|72906007

If
the infection
spreads|410677005
to the nervous system|25087005|278196006
it
can
cause|23981006|134198009
meningitis,|7180009
an infection
of the covering|255334000
of the brain|12738006|258335003
and
spinal cord.|2748008|180959008

Symptoms
of meningitis|7180009
are
headache,|25064002
stiff neck,|161882006
confusion,|286933003
loss
of balance,|249982003|78933003|282295000
and
convulsions.[3][4]

Listeriosis|4241002
has
a low incidence|62482003|371880002
in humans.|278412004

However,
pregnant women|255409004
are
much more likely|242762006|2931005|4757001|2931005
than the rest|258157001
of the population to|385436007|389109008
contract|78558002
it.

Infected pregnant women|255409004
may
have
only mild, flulike symptoms.|50607009|162468002|420295001|162468002

However,
infection
in a pregnant woman|255409004
can
lead|88488004
to early delivery,|264499004|236973005|264499004|118215003
infection
of the newborn,|133933007|46068001|255407002
and
death|419620001|268923008
of the baby.[3]|418119000

It
seems
that Listeria originally|23566007
evolved|59381007
to
invade
membranes|83097008
of the intestines,|261093006
as
an intracellular infection,|83167003
and
developed
a chemical mechanism to do so.|441900009|257544000

This
involves|248448006
a bacterial protein "internalin"|428710007
which
attaches|102491009
to a protein|88878007
on the intestinal cell membrane "cadherin."|261093006|53982002
These adhesion molecules|42685002|290005005
are
also to
be
found|404684003
in two other unusually tough barriers|420797005
in humans -|278412004
the blood brain barrier|20245001
and
the feto - placental barrier,|82530009
and
this
may
explain
the apparent affinity
that Listeria|23566007
has
for causing meningitis|23981006|7180009
and
affecting babies|247591002|418119000|248448006|418119000
in-utero.|35039007

In veterinary medicine,|53216000|410942007
listeriosis|4241002
can
be
a quite common condition|72906007|260905004
in some farm outbreaks.|224816003|443684005

It
can
also
be
found|404684003
in wild animals|262290003|387961004
;
see|281004000
listeriosis|4241002
in animals.|387961004

The disease primarily|64572001
affects|4065008
older adults,|105436006
persons|125676002
with weakened immune systems,|116003000
pregnant women,|255409004
and
newborns.|133933007

Rarely,|103356009
persons|125676002
without these risk factors|80943009
can
also
be
affected.|247591002|248448006

A person|125676002
with listeriosis usually|4241002
has
fever|386661006
and
muscle aches,|68962001
often|70232002
preceded|236874000
by diarrhea|398032003
or
other gastrointestinal symptoms.|74964007|267045008

Almost
everyone who
is
diagnosed|439401001
with listeriosis|4241002
has
invasive infection|10179008
(
meaning|255586005
that
the bacteria|409822003
spread|410677005
from their intestines|261093006
to their blood stream|87612001|257709004|119273009|257709004
or
other body sites|74964007|116677004
).

Disease|64572001
may
occur|272120004
as much|242762006|4757001
as two months|420797005|258706009
after eating contaminated food.|48263008|228034007

The symptoms
vary
with the infected person|125676002
:

If
a person|125676002
has
eaten food|48263008|255620007
contaminated|62604006
with Listeria|23566007
and
does
not
have
any symptoms,
most experts
believe
that
no tests|269814003|272393004
or
treatment|276239002|416118004
are
needed|410525008|103325001
,
even
for persons|125676002
at high risk|15508007
for listeriosis.[5]|4241002

_Listeria monocytogenes_|36094007
is
ubiquitous
in the environment.|276339004

The main route|63161005|284009009|63161005
of acquisition
of _Listeria_|23566007
is
through the ingestion|111984006
of contaminated food products.|62604006|255620007

_Listeria_|23566007
has
been
isolated|46651001
from raw meat,|6304003|28647000
dairy products,|226760005
vegetables,|22836000
fruit|72511004
and
seafood.|44027008

Soft cheeses,|226848002
unpasteurized milk|3718001|119321005|70813002
and
unpasteurised p?t?
are
potential dangers|30207005
;
however,
some outbreaks|443684005
involving|248448006
post-pasteurized milk|3718001|119321005|70813002
have
been
reported.[1]|229059009|223458004

Rarely listeriosis|103356009|4241002
may
present|52101004|246105001
as cutaneous listeriosis.|402128003

This infection
occurs|272120004
after direct exposure|255589003|71677004|255589003|24932003
to _L.|258995007|420559008

monocytogenes_
by intact skin|444884003
and
is
largely
confined
to veterinarians|106290006
who
are
handling
diseased animals,|64572001|387961004
most often|70232002
after a listerial abortion.[6]|57420002

In CNS infection cases,|128117002|398241000|128117002|413769002
_L.|258995007|420559008

monocytogenes_
can
often|70232002
be
cultured|252398009|61594008
from the blood,|87612001|119273009
and
always
cultured|252398009|61594008
from the CSF
(Cerebrospinal fluid|65216001
).

There
are
no reliable serological|27377004
or
stool tests.|104435004|167592004

The main means|63161005|255586005
of prevention|169443000
is
through the promotion
of safe handling,
cooking|106373003
and
consumption
of food.|255620007

This
includes|55919000
washing raw vegetables|314115004
and
cooking raw food thoroughly,|106373003|228067006
as well as
reheating leftover
or
ready-to-eat foods|48263008|255620007
like hot dogs|264018002|448771007|264018002
until steaming hot.[7]|27177009|264018002

Another aspect
of prevention|169443000
is
advising|424900004
high-risk|15508007
groups|261586004|160481000
such as pregnant women|255409004
and
immunocompromised patients to|370391006
avoid
unpasteurized p?t?s
and
foods|255620007
such as soft cheeses|226848002
like feta,
Brie,
Camembert cheese,|226856004
and
bleu.

Cream cheeses,|226849005
yogurt,|226863004
and
cottage cheese|226814003
are
considered
safe.

In the United Kingdom,|223860005
advice|420227002
along these lines|50009006
from the Chief Medical Officer|224533002
posted|288563008
in maternity clinics|394573001
led|88488004|236874000
to a sharp decline|410707003
in cases|398241000|413769002
of listeriosis|4241002
in pregnancy|289908002
in the late 1980s.[8]|260383002

Bacteremia|5758002
should
be
treated|28995006
for 2 weeks,|260306008|258705008
meningitis|7180009
for 3 weeks,|260313008|258705008
and
brain abscess|441806004
for
at least 6 weeks.|276139006|258705008|263796003|258705008

Ampicillin generally|387170002
is
considered antibiotic|255631004
of choice
;
gentamicin|387321007|411310000
is
added frequently|70232002
for its synergistic effects.|253861007

Overall mortality rate|409651001
is
20?30%
;
of all pregnancy-related cases,|289908002|272151006|398241000|289908002|272151006|413769002|289908002|262094002|398241000|289908002|262094002|413769002
22%
resulted|42752001|394617004
in fetal loss
or
neonatal death,|276506001
but
mothers usually|72705000
survive.[9]_[citation
needed|410525008|103325001
_].

Incidence
in 2004?2005
was
2.5?3 cases|264655001|398241000|264655001|413769002
per million population|385436007|389109008
a year|258707000|259039008
in the United States,|223688001
where pregnant women|255409004
accounted
for 30%
of all cases.|398241000|413769002

Of all nonperinatal infections,
70%
occur|272120004
in immunocompromised patients.|370391006

Incidence
in the U.S.|223688001

has
been
falling|1912002
since
the 1990s,
in contrast
to Europe|223502009
where
changes|243326001|263703002
in eating habits|116060000
have
led|88488004|236874000
to an increase|260366006
during the same time.|262126009|410669006

In Sweden,|223681007
it
has
stabilized|409051000
at
around 5 cases per annum|264706000|398241000|258707000|264706000|413769002|258707000|264605009|398241000|258707000|264605009|413769002|258707000
per million population,|385436007|389109008
with pregnant women typically|255409004
accounting
for 1?2|303183002
of some 40 total yearly cases.[11]|259031006|258755000|53281000|398241000|259031006|258755000|53281000|413769002|259031006|255619001|53281000|398241000|259031006|255619001|53281000|413769002

There
are
four distinct clinical syndromes|421534005|58147004
:

Particular strains|48532005|276768000
of _Listeria monocytogenes_|36094007
are
able to|371150009
invade
the heart,|80891009|302509004
leading|236874000
to serious|42745003
and
difficult-to-|52925006
treat|395077000
heart infections.|80891009|302509004

About 10 percent|118582008
of serious listeria infections|42745003|4241002
involve|248448006
cardiac infections|80891009
that
are
difficult to|52925006
treat|395077000
,
with more|242762006
than one-third|421379005|70905002
proving|277025001
fatal.|399166001

A strain|48532005|276768000
of listeria|23566007
had
been
isolated|46651001
from a patient|116154003
with endocarditis|56819008
(infection
of the heart|80891009|302509004
).

Usually
with endocarditis,|56819008
there
is
bacterial growth|88458008
on heart valves,|17401000
but
in this case|398241000
the infection
had
invaded
the cardiac muscle.|74281007

When
mice|447612001|447482001
were
infected
with
either
the cardiac isolate|80891009|46651001
or
a lab strain,|261904005|48532005|261904005|276768000
10 times|410669006|417929005
as much bacteria|409822003
were
found|404684003
in the hearts|80891009
of mice|447612001|447482001
infected
with the cardiac strain.|80891009|48532005|80891009|276768000

In the spleen|78961009|181279003
and
liver,|10200004|181268008
organs|410653004
that
are
commonly
targeted
by listeria,|23566007
the levels|258395000
of bacteria|409822003
were
equal|9726003
in
both
groups|261586004|160481000
of mice.|447612001|447482001

While
the lab-strain-infected group often|261904005|48532005|261586004|70232002|261904005|48532005|160481000|70232002|261904005|48532005|389109008|70232002|261904005|276768000|261586004|70232002|261904005|276768000|160481000|70232002|261904005|276768000|389109008|70232002
had
no heart infection|80891009|302509004
at all,
90 percent|264705001|118582008|264703008|118582008
of the mice|447612001|447482001
infected
with the cardiac strain|80891009|48532005|80891009|276768000
had
heart infections.|80891009|302509004

Only one other strain|50607009|421379005|48532005|50607009|421379005|276768000|420295001|421379005|48532005|420295001|421379005|276768000
of listeria|23566007
out of 10
acquired|255396000
seemed to also
target
the heart.|80891009|302509004

The results|394617004
suggest
that
these two cardiac-associated strains|420797005|80891009|47429007|48532005|420797005|80891009|47429007|276768000
display
modified proteins|88878007|243326001|88878007
on their surface|410678000
that
enable|225791005
the bacteria|409822003
to more easily|242762006|36203004
enter|417985001
cardiac cells,|80891009|4421005
targeting
the heart|80891009|302509004
and
leading|236874000
to bacterial infection.[12]|301811001

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|26216008|64572001|31509003|169443000
(CDC
)
there
are
about 1,600 cases|398241000|413769002
of listeriosis annually|4241002|53281000
in the United States.|223688001

Compared
to 1996-1998,
the incidence
of listeriosis|4241002
had
declined
by about 38%|264670000
by 2003.

However,
illnesses|39104002
and
deaths|419620001|268923008
continue|255238004
to
occur.|272120004

On average
from 1998-2008,
2.4 outbreaks|260306008|443684005
per year|258707000|259039008
were
