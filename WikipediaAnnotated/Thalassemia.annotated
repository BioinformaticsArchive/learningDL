*Thalassemia|40108008
*
*
(British English|297487008|25804004
:
*
*thalassaemia|40108008
*
*
)
are
forms|246176004
of inherited autosomal recessive blood disorders|255404009|258211005|34093004
that
originated
in the Mediterranean region.|410673009

In thalassemia,|40108008
the disease|64572001
is
caused|23981006|134198009
by the weakening
and
destruction|64597002
of red blood cells.|14089001|41898006|258759006|126242007

Whilst
possessing
the ability to|371150009
cause|23981006|134198009
significant complications,|386134007|116223007
including|55919000
anaemia,|271737000
iron overload,|60737008
bone deformities|271084006
and
cardiovascular illness,|113257007|39104002
thalassemia|40108008
may
confer
a degree|258395000|246173007
of protection
against malaria,|248437004
which
is
or
was
prevalent
in the regions|410673009
where the trait
is
common.|72906007

This selective survival advantage
on carriers|47461006
(
known|36692007
as heterozygous advantage|14556007
may
be
responsible|394851003
for perpetuating
the mutation|55446002
in populations.|385436007

In
that respect,
the various thalassemias|256220008|40108008
resemble
another genetic disorder affecting hemoglobin,|32895009|247591002|38082009|32895009|248448006|38082009
sickle-cell disease.|417357006

[2]|260306008

From the Greek _thalassa_|1451003
("sea"|225742004
)
and
_-emia_
("blood"|87612001|119273009
).

The etymology
indicates|410535002
the epidemiology
of the disorder|64572001
in
that
it commonly
occurs|272120004
in patients|116154003
of Mediterranean descent.

The term
was
first|255216001|232714002
used|394850002
in 1932.

The beta form|52095000|246176004|260989008|246176004
of thalassemia|40108008
is
particularly prevalent
among Mediterranean peoples|125676002
and
this geographical association|263534001|272151006
is
responsible|394851003
for its naming|27468005
:
_Thalassa
(???????
)
_
is
the Greek word|1451003|255373000
for sea|225742004
and
_Haema|87612001
(????
)
_
is
the Greek word|1451003|255373000
for blood.|87612001|119273009

In Europe,|223502009
the highest concentrations|75540009|82742001|371879000|82742001
of the disease|64572001
are
found|404684003
in Greece,|223651004
coastal regions|410673009
in Turkey|278900006|20657003
(particularly
the Aegean Region|410673009
such as Izmir,
Balikesir,
Aydin,
Mugla,
and
Mediterranean Region|410673009
such as Antalya,
Adana,
Mersin,
in parts|260726005
of Italy,|223668000
particularly Southern Italy|223668000
and
the lower Po valley.|261122009|260548002|285098003

The major Mediterranean islands|255603008|288560006
(
except the Balearics
such as Sicily,
Sardinia,|223839004
Malta,|223670009
Corsica,|223855006
Cyprus,|223649003
and
Crete|223822001
are
heavily
affected|247591002|248448006
in particular.

Other Mediterranean people,|74964007|125676002
as well as
those
in the vicinity
of the Mediterranean,
also
have
high rates|75540009|371879000
of thalassemia,|40108008
including|55919000
people|125676002
from West Asia|223500001
and
North Africa.|223498002

Far|46053002
from the Mediterranean,
South Asians|414978006
are
also
affected|247591002|248448006
,
with the world's highest concentration|75540009|82742001|371879000|82742001
of carriers|47461006
(16%
of the population|385436007|389109008
)
being
in the Maldives.|223601009

Nowadays,
it
is
found|404684003
in populations|385436007
living|224130005|419749002
in Africa,|223498002
the Americas
and
also,
in Tharu
in the Terai region|410673009
of Nepal|223602002
and
India.|223600005

It
is
believed to
account
for much lower malaria sicknesses|261122009|248437004|39104002
and
deaths,|419620001|268923008
[4] accounting|260308009
for the historic ability|371150009|392521001|371150009
of Tharus to
survive
in areas|42798000
with heavy malaria infestation,|410712002|248437004|17322007|410712002|248437004|410712002|248437004|410712002|248437004|33042004
where others|74964007
could
not.

Thalassemias|40108008
are
particularly
associated|47429007
with people|125676002
of Mediterranean origin,|255395001
Arabs|90027003
(especially Palestinians
and
people|125676002
of Palestinian descent
)
,
and
Asians.|414978006

The Maldives|223601009
has
the highest incidence|75540009|371879000
of Thalassemia|40108008
in the world
with a carrier rate|47461006|29679002
of 18%
of the population.|385436007|389109008

The estimated prevalence|414135002
is
16%
in people|125676002
from Cyprus,|223649003
1%[6]|260305007
in Thailand,|223594002
and
3-8%|260313008
in populations|385436007
from Bangladesh,|223598004
China,|223581004
India,|223600005
Malaysia|223591005
and
Pakistan.|223603007

Thalassemias also|40108008
occur|272120004
in descendants
of people|125676002
from Latin America
and
Mediterranean countries|223369002
(e.g.|258795003

Greece,|223651004
Italy,|223668000
Portugal,|223675004
Spain,|223680008
and
others|74964007
).

Normally,
hemoglobin|38082009
is
composed
of four protein chains,|421534005|88878007|46666003
two ?|420797005
and
two ? globin chains|420797005|259698001
arranged
into a heterotetramer.

In thalassemia,|40108008
patients|116154003
have
defects|6920004
in
either
the ?
or ? globin chain|259698001
(
unlike sickle-cell disease,|417357006
which
produces
a specific mutant form|69658003|246176004
of ? globin
)
,
causing|23981006
production
of abnormal red blood cells.|397019006

The
*
*thalassemias|40108008
*
*
are
classified|73504009
according to which
chain|46666003
of the hemoglobin molecule|38082009|290005005
is
affected.|247591002|248448006

In ? thalassemias,|40108008
production
of the ? globin chain|259698001
is
affected,|247591002|248448006
while
in ? thalassemia production|40108008
of the ? globin chain|259698001
is
affected.|247591002|248448006

The ? globin chains|259698001
are
encoded
by a single gene|125681006|67271001|50607009|67271001
on chromosome 11|16312006
;
? globin chains|259698001
are
encoded
by two closely linked genes|420797005|32316004
on chromosome 16.|39220001

Thus,
in a normal person|17621005|125676002|258744000|125676002
with two copies|420797005
of each chromosome,|91272006
there
are
*
*two|420797005
*
* loci
encoding
the ? chain,|46666003
and
*
*four|421534005
*
* loci
encoding
the ? chain.|46666003

Deletion
of one|421379005
of the ? loci
has
a high prevalence|75540009|371879000
in people|125676002
of African|413464008
or
Asian descent,|414978006
making
them more likely to|242762006|2931005
develop ? thalassemias.|40108008

? Thalassemias|40108008
are
not only common|72906007
in Africans,|413464008
but
also
in Greeks|1451003
and
Italians.|31637002

The ? thalassemias|40108008
involve|248448006
the genes HBA1[7]|67271001|33601001
and
HBA2,
[8]
inherited|255404009
in a Mendelian recessive fashion.

There
are
two gene loci|420797005|67271001
and
so four alleles.|223528007|421534005|9109004

It
is
also
connected
to the deletion
of the 16p chromosome.|91272006

? Thalassemias|40108008
result|394617004
in decreased alpha-globin production,|1250004|263660008|260400001|263660008|260371004|263660008
therefore fewer alpha-globin chains|263660008|259698001
are
produced
,
resulting|42752001
in an excess|260378005
of ? chains|46666003
in adults|133936004
and
excess ? chains|260378005|46666003
in newborns.|133933007

The excess ? chains|260378005|46666003
form|246176004
unstable tetramers|263922001|29488004
(called Hemoglobin H|70050002
or
HbH
of 4 beta chains|260308009|52095000|46666003|260308009|260989008|46666003
)
,
which
have
abnormal oxygen dissociation curves.|263654008|24099007|286669009|60301000

Beta thalassemias|65959000
are
due to mutations|55446002
in the HBB gene|67271001
on chromosome 11,|16312006
[9] also
inherited|255404009
in an autosomal-recessive fashion.|258211005

The severity|272141005
of the disease|64572001
depends
on the nature|277302009
of the mutation.|55446002

Mutations|55446002
are
characterized
as either ?o|257971007
or ? thalassemia major|75451007
if
they
prevent
any formation|11798007|255277001
of ? chains,|46666003
the most severe form|4757001|24484000|246176004
of ? thalassemia.|40108008

Also,
they
are
characterized
as ?+
or ? thalassemia intermedia|934007
if
they
allow
some ? chain formation to|46666003|11798007|46666003|255277001
occur.|272120004

In
either
case,|398241000
there
is
a relative excess|125677006|260378005|29920004|260378005
of ? chains,|46666003
but
these
do
not
form|246176004
tetramers|29488004
:
Rather,
they
bind|257768005
to the red blood cell membranes,|41898006|83097008
producing
membrane damage,|83097008|37782003
and
at high concentrations|75540009|82742001|371879000|82742001
they
form|246176004
toxic aggregates.|18403000

As well as
alpha|263660008
and
beta chains|52095000|46666003|260989008|46666003
present|52101004|246105001
in hemoglobin,|38082009
about 3%
of adult hemoglobin|133936004|38082009
is
made
of alpha|263660008
and
delta chains.|261003002|46666003

Just
as
with beta thalassemia,|65959000
mutations|55446002
that
affect|4065008
the ability|371150009
of this gene to|67271001
produce
delta chains|261003002|46666003
can
occur|272120004
_[citation

Thalassemia|40108008
can
co-exist
with other hemoglobinopathies.

The most common|4757001|72906007
of these
are
:

Both ?
and ? thalassemias|40108008
are
often|70232002
inherited|255404009
in an autosomal recessive fashion,|258211005
although
this
is
not always
the case.|398241000

Cases|398241000|413769002
of dominantly
inherited ?|255404009
and ? thalassemias|40108008
have
been
reported|229059009|223458004
,
the first|255216001|232714002
of which
was
in an Irish family|35359004
with two deletions|420797005
of 4|260308009
and
11 bp
in exon 3|33091005
interrupted|261017006
by an insertion|71861002|257867005
of 5 bp|264706000|264605009
in the ?-globin gene.|67271001

For the autosomal recessive forms|258211005|246176004
of the disease,|64572001
both
parents|40683002
must
be
carriers|47461006
in order
for a child to|410601007|160499008
be
affected.|247591002|248448006

If
both
parents|40683002
carry|288345009
a hemoglobinopathy trait,|80141007
there
is
a 25% risk|30207005
with each pregnancy|289908002
for an affected child.|247591002|410601007|247591002|160499008|248448006|410601007|248448006|160499008

Genetic counseling|79841006
and
genetic testing|405824009
is
recommended
for families|35359004
that
carry|288345009
a thalassemia trait.|19442009

There

Collectively,
results|394617004
demonstrate
that indicaxanthin
can
be
incorporated
into the redox machinery|84294004|20273004
of ?-thalassemic RBC|14089001|41898006

In 2008,
in Spain,|223680008
a baby|418119000
was
selectively
implanted|40388003
in order to
be
a cure
for his brother's thalassemia.|70924004|40108008

The child|410601007|160499008
was
born|106970005|81827009|398209006
from an embryo|57991002
screened|20135006|360156006
to
be
free|37837009
of the disease|64572001
before implantation|71861002|25602002
with
In vitro fertilization.|55767001

The baby's supply|418119000|425398004
of immunologically compatible cord blood|385433004|12499000|7883008|12499000
was
saved
for transplantation|263903005
to his sister.|27733009

The transplantation|263903005
was
considered
successful.|385669000

In 2009,
a group|261586004|160481000|389109008
of doctors|309343006
and
specialists|309395003
in Chennai
and
Coimbatore
registered|229053005
the successful treatment|182985004
of thalassemia|40108008
in a child|410601007|160499008
using|260676000
a sibling's umbilical cord blood.[17]|375005|12499000

It
is
possible to|371930009|60022001
be
cured
,
with no more|242762006
need|410525008|103325001
of blood transfusions,
thanks
to Bone Marrow Transplantation (BMT)|23719005
from compatible donor,|385433004|385433004|105468003|7883008|7883008|105468003
invented
in the 1980?s
by Prof.

Guido Lucarelli.

In low risk young patients,|62482003|30207005|84422007|116154003|371880002|30207005|84422007|116154003
the thalassemia free survival rate|40108008|37837009
is
87%
;
the mortality risk|409651001|30207005
is
3%.[18]|260284005

If
the patient|116154003
doesn?t
have
an HLA-matched compatible donor,|47038001|33336008|385433004|47038001|33336008|385433004|105468003|47038001|33336008|7883008|47038001|33336008|7883008|105468003
there
is
another cure called Bone Marrow Transplantation|23719005
(BMT|23719005
)
from haploidentical mother|72705000
to child|410601007|160499008
(mismatched donor|105468003
)
,
in which
the donor|105468003
is
the mother.|72705000

It
was
invented
in 2002
by Dr.|309343006

Pietro Sodani.

The results|394617004
are
:
thalassemia free survival rate 70%,|40108008|37837009
rejection 23%|264657009
and
mortality 7%.|409651001

The best results|394617004
are
with very young patients.|260358002|84422007|116154003

Epidemiological evidence|18669006
from Kenya|223534000
suggests
another reason|410666004
:
protection
against severe malarial anemia|24484000|248437004|271737000
may
be
the advantage.[20]

People|125676002

with heterozygous|14556007
(carrier|47461006|29679002

some protection
against coronary heart disease.[21]|53741008
