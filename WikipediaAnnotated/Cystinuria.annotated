*Cystinuria|85020001
*
*
is
an inherited autosomal recessive[1] disease|32895009|258211005
that
is
characterized
by the formation|11798007|255277001
of cystine stones|37927000|384600008
in the kidneys,|64033007|17373004
ureter,|264254009|302511008
and
bladder.|89837001|302512001

Cystinuria|85020001
is
a cause|134198009
of persistent kidney stones.|95570007|444717006

It
is
a disease|64572001
involving|248448006
the defective transepithelial transport|57188001|360300001
of cystine|37927000
and
dibasic amino acids|52518006
in the kidney|64033007|17373004|181414000
and
intestine,|261093006
and
is
one|421379005
of many causes|134198009
of kidney stones.|95570007|444717006

If
not
treated|28995006
properly,
the disease|64572001
could
cause|23981006|134198009
serious damage|42745003|37782003
to the kidneys|64033007|17373004
and
surrounding organs,|355648006|410653004
and
in some rare cases death.|84638005|398241000|419620001|84638005|398241000|268923008|84638005|413769002|419620001|84638005|413769002|268923008|103356009|398241000|419620001|103356009|398241000|268923008|103356009|413769002|419620001|103356009|413769002|268923008

The stones|384600008
may
be
identified|7882003
by a positive nitroprusside cyanide test.|258758003|372860000|259102005|269814003|258758003|372860000|259102005|258758003|372860000|259102005|272393004|10828004|372860000|259102005|269814003|10828004|372860000|259102005|10828004|372860000|259102005|272393004

The crystals|250448002|264297004|413935006
are
usually hexagonal, translucent,|300828005
white.|413773004|185984009|371251000

Upon removal,|118292001|128303001
the stones|384600008
may
be
pink|371243003
or
yellow|263935005
in color,|263714004
but
later
they
turn|282987006
to
greenish
due to exposure|71677004|24932003
to air.|417696007

Cystinuria|85020001
is
an autosomal recessive disease,|258211005|64572001
[1]|260305007
which means|255586005
that
the defective gene|67271001
responsible|394851003
for the disease|64572001
is
located
on an autosome,
and
two copies|420797005
of the defective gene|67271001
(one|421379005
inherited|255404009
from each parent|40683002
)
are
required
in order to
be
born|106970005|81827009|398209006
with the disease.|64572001

The parents|40683002
of an individual|125676002|385435006
with an autosomal recessive disease|258211005|64572001
both
carry|288345009
one copy|421379005
of the defective gene,|67271001
but
usually
do
not
experience
any signs|72670004
or
symptoms
of the disease.|64572001

Cystinuria|85020001
is
caused|23981006|134198009
by mutations|55446002
in the _SLC3A1_
and
_SLC7A9_ genes.|67271001

These genes|67271001
encode
two parts|420797005|260726005
of a transporter protein|16267005
that
is
made primarily
in the kidneys.|64033007|17373004

These defects|6920004
prevent
proper reabsorption
of basic,|418836005
or
positively
charged
,
amino acids|52518006
:
lysine,|418834008
ornithine,|8514004
arginine.|52625008

Under normal circumstances,|17621005|258744000
this protein|88878007
allows
certain amino acids,|17162000|52518006
including|55919000
cysteine,|5932006
to
be
reabsorbed
into the blood|87612001|119273009
from the filtered fluid|116250002|32457005|116250002|33463005|116250002|255765007|116250002|258648006|32457005|258648006|33463005|258648006|255765007|258648006
that
will
become
urine.|78014005

Mutations|55446002
in either
of these genes|67271001
disrupt
the ability|371150009
of this transporter protein to|16267005
reabsorb
these amino acids,|52518006
allowing
them to
become
concentrated
in the urine.|78014005

As the levels|258395000
of cystine|37927000
in the urine increase,|78014005|260366006
the crystals|250448002|264297004|413935006
typical
of cystinuria|85020001
are
able to|371150009
form|246176004
,
resulting|42752001
in kidney stones.|95570007|444717006

Cystine crystals|37927000|250448002|37927000|264297004|37927000|413935006
form|246176004
hexagonal-shaped crystals|107644003|250448002|107644003|264297004|107644003|413935006|300842002|250448002|300842002|264297004|300842002|413935006
that
can
be
viewed|246516004
upon microscopic analysis|84496004|272389005
of the urine.|78014005

The other amino acids|74964007|52518006
that
are
not
reabsorbed
do
not
create
crystals|250448002|264297004|413935006
in urine.|78014005

The disease|64572001
affects|4065008
1
in 10,000 people,|125676002
making
it the most common genetic error|4757001|72906007|3950001|4757001|72906007|255395001
of amino acid transport.|52518006|57188001|52518006|360300001

Cystinuria|85020001
is
inherited|255404009
in an autosomal recessive pattern.|258211005|272135003

Cystinuria|85020001
is
characterized
by the inadequate reabsorption|71978007
of cystine|37927000
in the proximal convoluted tubules|50468005
after the filtering|116250002|258648006
of the amino acids|52518006
by the kidney's glomeruli,|68288006
thus
resulting|42752001
in an excessive concentration|260378005|82742001
of this amino acid|52518006
in the urine.|78014005

Cystine|37927000
may
precipitate
out of the urine,|78014005
if
the urine|78014005
is
neutral
or
acidic,|34957004
and
form crystals|246176004|250448002|246176004|264297004|246176004|413935006
or
stones|384600008
in the kidneys,|64033007|17373004
ureters,|264254009
or
bladder.|89837001|302512001

It
is
one|421379005
of several inborn errors|261028005
of metabolism|47722004
included|55919000
in the Garrod's tetrad.

The disease|64572001
is
attributed|246061005
to deficiency|260372006|248325000
in transport|57188001|360300001
and
metabolism|47722004
of amino acids.|52518006

Cystinuria|85020001
is
usually asymptomatic|84387000
when
no stone|384600008
is
formed.|35810008

However,
once
a stone|384600008
is
formed,|35810008
or
if stone production|384600008
is
severe|24484000
or
frequent, symptoms|70232002
may
be
present|52101004|246105001
:
_[citation

Cystinurics
can
also
experience
chronic pain|82423001
in one,|421379005
or
both,
kidneys[3]|64033007|17373004
due to the scars|70582006|275322007
that
the jagged edges|57183005
of the stones|384600008
can
leave|7771000|90737002
or
damage|37782003
from multiple stone removal surgeries.|260396001|384600008|118292001|83578000|260396001|384600008|128303001|83578000

This
can
leave|7771000|90737002
a cystinuric|85020001
in constant pain|426206001
which often|70232002
requires
medical intervention,|74188005|225334002
such as long term use|277889008|419385000
of analgesics|373265006
or
surgical procedures,|83578000
including|55919000
T11,
T12|66632004
or
T13 nerve blocks|64874008
(
although
,
these procedures|71388002
are
often|70232002
not successful,|385669000
they
can
provide
some relief|224978009
).

Aside from the chronic pain,|82423001
a cystinuric
will
often|70232002
have
severe breakthrough pain|76948002|255298001
from passing stones.|384600008

This type|261664005
of severe pain,|76948002
if
not properly
treated|28995006
,
will
force|285653008
the cystinuric to|85020001
seek
help
in an Emergency Department|225728007
or
Urgent Care facility.|103391001

Since
most cystinurics
pass
stones monthly,|384600008|89185003
weekly,|14497002
or
daily,|69620002
and
need ongoing care,|410525008|255238004|103325001|255238004
this usually
causes|134198009
medical staff|74188005
to label
these patients|116154003
as drug seekers|410942007
or
hypochondriacs.

Cystinurics
have
an increased risk|35105006|30207005|260366006|30207005
for chronic kidney disease[5][6]|46177005|236425005
and
since kidney damage|64033007|37782003|17373004|37782003|181414000|37782003
or
poor function|11403006|246464006|255351007|246464006
is
often|70232002
present|52101004|246105001
in cystinurics,
the use|277889008|419385000
of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)|372665008
or
over the counter (OTC) medications|80288002|410942007
should
be
used|394850002
with caution.

This
leaves|90737002
the patient|116154003
with little choices
regarding
pain control|278414003|225782006
and
can
lead|88488004
to insufficient medical intervention|71978007|74188005|225334002|423437008|74188005|225334002
by physicians.|309343006

Cystine stones|37927000|384600008
are
often|70232002
not visible|24054004
on most x-rays,|52250000|168537006
CT's,
and
ultrasounds.|359659005

This
does
not
mean|255586005
the cystinuric|85020001
doesn't
have
a stone.|384600008

It
takes|419652001
a trained eye|118629009|81745001|118629009|244486005|62193008|81745001|62193008|244486005
and
experience
to
spot|23840004
a cystine stone.|37927000|384600008

It
is
not unusual
for a cystinuric to|85020001
pass
a stone,|384600008
or
stones,|384600008
after
being
released|68776005|129299003
from the hospital|285201006
with a CT
or
x-ray result|394617004|52250000|394617004|168537006|394617004|363680008|394617004

with the disease|64572001
may
be
present.|52101004|246105001

Currently genotyping|15240007|363779003
is
not available|103328004
in the United States|223688001
but
might
be
available|103328004
in Spain|223680008
and
Italy.|223668000

Regular x-rays often|17854005|70232002|17854005|52250000|70232002|17854005|168537006|70232002
fail
to
show
the cystine stones.|37927000|384600008

Cystine stones|37927000|384600008
seem
to
be
'invisible'|66486002
with this method|260686004|272394005
unless
a dye|61789006
is
added
to the blood stream|87612001|257709004|119273009|257709004
(IVP|32265006

alkalization
of the urine|78014005
with citrate supplementation|59351004
or
acetazolamide,|372709008
and
dietary modification to|41829006|243326001
reduce|260400001
salt|387390002
and
protein intake|88878007
(especially methionine|70288006
).

If
this
fails
then patients|116154003
are
usually
started|385652002
on chelation therapy|276239002
with an agent|260872001
such as penicillamine.|387235007

Once renal stones|95570007
have
formed|35810008
,
however,
the first-line treatment|255216001|50009006|276239002|255216001|50009006|416118004|232714002|50009006|276239002|232714002|50009006|416118004
is
ESWL|44345001

If ESWL|44345001
do
not
work|261041009
efficiently surgery|83578000
can
be
necessary.

Both
endoscopic surgery|85876005
and
conventional open-abdominal surgery|255333006|129236007|277112006
have
proven|277025001
to
be
effective treatment modalities|255403003|276239002|255403003|416118004|254648000|276239002|254648000|416118004
for patients|116154003
with more advanced disease.|242762006|86005002|64572001

Jeffrey Rimer
of the University of Houston|224871002
suggested
in October 2010
that treatment|276239002|416118004
with L-cystine dimethylester|37927000
could
prevent
the formation|11798007|255277001
of these kidney stones.[10]|95570007|444717006

Videos|257194007
of surgery|83578000
are
available|103328004
on various websites|256220008
that
show

This disease|64572001
is
known to|36692007
occur|272120004
in
at least three mammalian species|276139006|421291004|387976007|69658003|263796003|421291004|387976007|69658003
