*Syphilis|76272004
*
*
is
a sexually transmitted infection|8098009
caused|23981006|134198009
by the spirochete bacterium _Treponema pallidum_ subspecies _pallidum_.|38732005|409822003|72904005|115169007|409822003|72904005|409822003|72904005|418489004|409822003|72904005

The primary route|63161005|284009009|63161005|261424001|284009009|261424001
of transmission|258150004
is
through sexual contact|365952006|11723008|365952006|70862002
;
it
may
also
be
transmitted|60117003|258150004
from mother|72705000
to fetus|83418008
during pregnancy|289908002
or
at birth,|3950001
resulting|42752001
in congenital syphilis.|35742006

Other human diseases|74964007|278412004|64572001
caused|23981006|134198009
by related _Treponema pallidum_|272151006|72904005|262094002|72904005
include|55919000
yaws|70647001
(subspecies _pertenue_
)
,
pinta|22064009
(subspecies _carateum_
)
,
and
bejel|240688009
(subspecies _endemicum_
).

The signs|72670004
and
symptoms
of syphilis|76272004
vary
depending
in which
of the four|421534005
stages|261612004
it
presents|52101004|246105001
(primary, secondary, latent,|63161005|2603003|44104002|63161005|81170007|44104002|261424001|2603003|44104002|261424001|81170007|44104002
and
tertiary|84965000
).

The primary stage classically|63161005|21191007|63161005|371508000|63161005|261612004|261424001|21191007|261424001|371508000|261424001|261612004
presents|52101004|246105001
with a single chancre|125681006|125681006|84052006|50607009|50607009|84052006
(
a firm,|20583004
painless,|255350008
non-itchy skin ulceration|424492005|429040005|424492005|46742003
)
,
secondary syphilis|240557004
with a diffuse rash|19648000|271807003
which frequently|70232002
involves|248448006
the palms|107631008
of the hands|85562004
and
soles|57999000
of the feet,|56459004|259051005
latent syphilis|444150000
with little|281411007|255507004
to no symptoms,
and
tertiary syphilis|72083004
with gummas,|67103005
neurological,|1199008
or
cardiac symptoms.|80891009

It
has
,
however,
been
known|36692007
as "
the great imitator"|255509001|263768009
due to its frequent atypical presentations.|70232002|112231000|246105001

Diagnosis|439401001
is
usually
via blood tests|252275004
;
however,
the bacteria|409822003
can
also
be
visualized|255374006
under a microscope.|65473004

Syphilis|76272004
can
be
effectively
treated|28995006
with antibiotics,|255631004
specifically
the preferred intramuscular penicillin G|225773000|76601001|78507004|225773000|255559005|78507004
(
given|419582001
intravenously
for neurosyphilis|26039008
)
,
or
else ceftriaxone,|372670001
and
in those
who
have
a severe penicillin allergy,|24484000|91936005
oral doxycycline|260548002|372478003
or
azithromycin.|387531004

Syphilis|76272004
is
believed to
have
infected
12 million people worldwide|125676002
in 1999,
with greater|263768009
than 90%|264705001|264703008
of cases|398241000|413769002
in the developing world.

After
decreasing|260371004
dramatically
since
the widespread availability|85333001|103328004
of penicillin|373270004
in the 1940s,
rates
of infection
have
increased|35105006|260366006
since
the turn|282987006
of the millennium
in many countries,|223369002
often|70232002
in combination|89780004
with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).|19030005|86406008

This
has
been
attributed|246061005
partly to
unsafe
sexual practices|365952006
among men|339947000
who
have
sex|258139002|365952006|263495000|70256003|57312000
with men,|339947000
increased promiscuity,|35105006|85892000|260366006|85892000
prostitution,|53713009
and
decreasing use|260371004|277889008|260371004|419385000
of barrier protection.[1][2][3]

Syphilis|76272004
can
present|52101004|246105001
in one|421379005
of four different stages|421534005|263735002|261612004
:
primary, secondary, latent,|63161005|2603003|44104002|63161005|81170007|44104002|261424001|2603003|44104002|261424001|81170007|44104002
and
tertiary,[4]|84965000
and
may
also
occur|272120004
congenitally.

It
was
referred|439980006
to
as
"
the great imitator"|255509001|263768009
by Sir William Osler
due to its varied presentations.[4][6]|246105001

Primary syphilis|266127002
is
typically
acquired|255396000
by direct sexual contact|255589003|365952006|11723008|255589003|365952006|70862002
with the infectious lesions
of another person.|125676002

Approximately 3|26175008
to 90 days|264705001|258703001|264703008|258703001
after the initial exposure|884001|71677004|884001|24932003|232714002|71677004|232714002|24932003
(average 21 days|258703001
)
a skin lesion,|95324001
called
a chancre,|84052006
appears
at the point
of contact.|11723008|70862002

This
is
classically
(40%|259031006
of the time|410669006
)
a single, firm,|125681006|20583004|50607009|20583004
painless,|255350008
non-itchy skin ulceration|424492005|429040005|424492005|46742003
with a clean base
and
sharp borders|410707003|112233002
between 0.3
and
3.0 cm|260313008
in size.|277049003

The lesion,
however,
may
take|419652001
on almost
any form.|246176004

In the classic form,|255301002|246176004|255333006|246176004
it
evolves|59381007
from a macule|112629002
to a papule|443871003|445328000
and
finally
to an erosion#Primary_lesions|15498001|63161005|15498001|261424001
)
or
ulcer.|429040005

Occasionally,
multiple lesions|300582001
may
be
present|52101004|246105001
(~40%|259031006
)
,
[4]|260308009
with multiple lesions|300582001
more common|242762006|72906007
when
coinfected
with HIV.|19030005|86406008|402916007

Lesions
may
be
painful|22253000
or
tender|300820003
(30%
)
,
and
they
may
occur|272120004
outside of the genitals
(2?7%|260306008
).

The most common location|4757001|72906007|246267002
in women|224526002
is
the cervix|71252005
(44%
)
,
the penis|18911002|265793009
in heterosexual men|339947000|20430005|339947000
(99%
)
,
and
anally
and
rectally relatively commonly
in men|339947000
who
have
sex|258139002|365952006|263495000|70256003|57312000
with men|339947000
(34%
).

Lymph node enlargement frequently|30746006|70232002
(80%
)
occurs|272120004
around the area|42798000
of infection,
[4]|260308009
occurring|272120004
seven|420359007
to 10 days|258703001
after chancre formation.|11798007|255277001|84052006|11798007|84052006|255277001

The lesion
may
persist
for three|421291004
to six weeks|422218008|258705008
without treatment.[4]|276239002|416118004

Secondary syphilis|240557004
occurs|272120004
approximately four to|26175008|421534005
ten|23067006|420258001
weeks|258705008
after the primary infection.|63161005|261424001

While
secondary disease|48873002
is
known|36692007
for the many different ways|260396001|263735002
it
can
manifest|250255003
,
symptoms most commonly
involve|248448006
the skin,|119325001|39937001|181469002
mucous membranes,|313268005
and
lymph nodes.|59441001

There
may
be
a symmetrical, reddish-pink,|18772005|371243003
non-itchy rash|64144002
on the trunk|22943007|262225004
and
extremities,|66019005|2592007
including|55919000
the palms|107631008
and
soles.|57999000

The rash|271807003
may
become
maculopapular|263804000
or
pustular.|255441005

It
may
form|246176004
flat, broad, whitish,|6041008|90522003|257564005|90522003
wart-like lesions|57019003
known|36692007
as condyloma latum|91554004
on mucous membranes.|313268005

All
of these lesions
harbor|257621007
bacteria|409822003
and
are
infectious.

Other symptoms|74964007
may
include|55919000
fever,|386661006
sore throat,|405737000|267102003
malaise,|367391008
weight loss,|89362005
hair loss,|278040002
and
headache.|25064002

Rare manifestations|84638005|250255003|84638005|251190009|103356009|250255003|103356009|251190009
include|55919000
hepatitis,|128241005|40468003|396423004
kidney disease,|90708001
arthritis,|3723001
periostitis,|41910004
optic neuritis,|66760008
uveitis,|128473001
and
interstitial keratitis.|1763009

The acute symptoms usually|272118002
resolve
after three|421291004
to six weeks|422218008|258705008
;[11] however,
about 25%
of people|125676002
may
present|52101004|246105001
with a recurrence|246455001
of secondary symptoms.|2603003|81170007

Many people|260396001|125676002
who
present|52101004|246105001
with secondary syphilis|240557004
(40?85%|259031006
of women,|224526002
20?65%|264695004
of men|339947000
)
do
not
report|229059009|223458004
previously
having
had
the classic chancre|255301002|255301002|84052006|255333006|255333006|84052006
of primary syphilis.[9]|266127002

Latent syphilis|444150000
is
defined
as
having
serologic proof|27377004|229796008
of infection
without symptoms
of disease.|64572001

It
is
further|46053002
described
as
either
early|264499004
(less
than 1 year|260305007|258707000|260305007|259039008
after secondary syphilis|240557004
)
or
late|260383002
(more|242762006
than 1 year|260305007|258707000|260305007|259039008
after secondary syphilis|240557004
)
in the United States.|223688001

The United Kingdom|223860005
uses|277889008|394850002|260676000|419385000
a cut-off|283396008
of two years|420797005|258707000
for early|264499004
and
late latent syphilis.|186903006

Early latent syphilis|44104002|264499004|444150000
may
have
a relapse|263855007|255318003|58184002
of symptoms.

Late latent syphilis|186903006
is
asymptomatic,|84387000
and
not
as contagious
as early latent syphilis.[11]|44104002|264499004|444150000

Tertiary syphilis|72083004
may
occur|272120004
approximately 3|26175008
to 15 years|258707000
after the initial infection,|884001|232714002
and
may
be
divided|422033008
into three different forms|421291004|263735002|246176004
:
gummatous syphilis|76272004
(15%
)
,
late neurosyphilis|260383002|26039008
(6.5%|260271001
)
,
and
cardiovascular syphilis|83883001
(10%
).

Without treatment,|276239002|416118004
a third|70905002
of infected people|125676002
develop
tertiary disease.|84965000|64572001

People|125676002
with tertiary syphilis|72083004
are
not infectious.[4]

Gummatous syphilis|76272004
or
late benign syphilis usually|72083004|30807003
occurs|272120004
1
to 46 years|258707000
after the initial infection,|884001|232714002
with an average
of 15 years.|258707000

This stage|21191007|371508000|261612004
is
characterized
by the formation|11798007|255277001
of chronic gummas,|90734009|67103005
which
are
soft, tumor-like balls|37378003|108369006
of inflammation|257552002
which
may
vary
considerably
in size.|277049003

They typically
affect|4065008
the skin,|119325001|39937001|181469002
bone,|272673000|3138006|90780006|128530007
and
liver,|10200004|181268008
but
can
occur|272120004
anywhere.[4]

Neurosyphilis refers|26039008|439980006
to an infection
involving|248448006
the central nervous system.|21483005|278199004

It
may
occur|272120004
early,|264499004
being
either
asymptomatic|84387000
or
in the form|246176004
of syphilitic meningitis,|301086002
or
late|260383002
as meningovascular syphilis,
general paresis,|51928006
or
tabes dorsalis,|315826004
which
is
associated|47429007
with poor balance|249985001
and
lightning pains|49575005
in the lower extremities.|61685007

Late neurosyphilis typically|260383002|26039008
occurs|272120004
4
to 25 years|258707000
after the initial infection.|884001|232714002

Meningovascular syphilis typically
presents|52101004|246105001
with apathy|20602000
and
seizure,|91175000
and
general paresis|51928006
with dementia|12348006|52448006
and
tabes dorsalis.|315826004

Also,
there
may
be
Argyll Robertson pupils,|4129001
which
are
bilateral small pupils|51440002|63251006
that constrict|410719006
when
the person|125676002
focuses|251776000|87017008|363702006
on near objects,|277752003|260787004
but
do
not
constrict|410719006
when
exposed|24932003
to bright light.|221668007|56242006|221668007|371268001

Cardiovascular syphilis usually|83883001
occurs|272120004
10?30 years|258707000
after the initial infection.|884001|232714002

The most common complication|4757001|72906007|116223007|4757001|72906007|263718001
is
syphilitic aortitis,|20735004
which
may
result|394617004
in aneurysm formation.[4]|432119003|11798007|432119003|255277001

Congenital syphilis|35742006
may
occur|272120004
during pregnancy|289908002
or
during birth.|3950001

Two-thirds|420797005|70905002
of syphilitic infants|263891000|418119000
are
born|106970005|81827009|398209006
without symptoms.

Common symptoms|72906007
that then
develop
over the first couple years|255216001|258707000|232714002|258707000
of life|224130005

_Treponema pallidum_ subspecies _pallidum_|72904005
is
a spiral-shaped, Gram-negative, highly mobile bacterium.|63879006|81325006|75540009

Three other human diseases|421291004|278412004|64572001
are
caused|23981006|134198009
by related _Treponema pallidum_,|272151006|72904005|262094002|72904005
including|55919000
yaws|70647001

)
,
pinta|22064009
(subspecies _carateum_
)
and
bejel|240688009
(subspecies _endemicum_
).

Unlike subtype _pallidum_,|260837004|14738005
they
do
not
cause|23981006|134198009
neurological disease.|118940003

Humans|278412004
are
the only known natural reservoir|50607009|36692007|510009|257687008|420295001|36692007|510009|257687008
for subspecies _pallidum_.|14738005

It
is
unable to|371151008
survive
without a host
for more
than a few days.|57176003|258703001

This
is
due to its small genome|255507004|18470003
(1.14 MDa failing to|260305007|44555003|260305007|223654007
encode
the metabolic pathways necessary to|129457002
make
most
of its macronutrients.

It
has
a slow doubling time|419443000|1305003|410669006
of greater|263768009
than 30 hours.[8]|258702006

Syphilis|76272004
is
transmitted primarily|60117003|258150004
by sexual contact|365952006|11723008|365952006|70862002
or
during pregnancy|289908002
from a mother|72705000
to her fetus|83418008
;
the spirochaete|38732005|115169007|418489004
is
able to|371150009
pass
through intact mucous membranes|249125003|49909006|249125003|255433005|11163003|313268005
or
compromised skin.|119325001|39937001|181469002

It
is
thus transmissible
by kissing|78962002
near a lesion,
as well as
oral, vaginal,|260548002|76784001|260548002
and
anal sex.|53505006|258139002|53505006|365952006|53505006|263495000|53505006|70256003|53505006|57312000|263939004|258139002|263939004|365952006|263939004|263495000|263939004|70256003|263939004|57312000

Approximately 30|26175008
to 60%
of those
exposed|24932003
to primary|63161005|261424001
or
secondary syphilis|240557004
will
get
the disease.|64572001

Its infectivity
is
exemplified
by the fact
that
an individual|125676002|385435006
inoculated
with only 57 organisms|50607009|410653004|420295001|410653004
has
a 50% chance
of
being
infected.

Most|4757001
(60%
)
of new cases|7147002|398241000|7147002|413769002
in the United States|223688001
occur|272120004
in men|339947000
who
have
sex|258139002|365952006|263495000|70256003|57312000
with men.|339947000

It
can
be
transmitted|60117003|258150004
via blood products.|410652009

However,
it
is
tested|272393004
for
in many countries|223369002
and
thus
the risk|30207005
is
low.|62482003|371880002

The risk|30207005
of transmission|258150004
from sharing needles|79068005
appears
limited.|255469002

Syphilis|76272004
cannot
be
contracted|78558002
through toilet seats,|53303003
daily activities,|69620002|257733005
hot tubs,|264018002
or
sharing eating utensils|48263008
or
clothing.[14]|272180002

Syphilis|76272004
is
difficult to|52925006
diagnose|439401001
clinically early|264499004
in its presentation.|246105001

Confirmation|74996004
is
either
via blood tests|252275004
or
direct visual inspection|255589003|255374006|32750006
using|260676000
microscopy.|117259009

Blood tests|252275004
are
more commonly|242762006
used|394850002
,
as
they
are
easier to|36203004
perform.|398166005

Diagnostic tests|103693007
are
,
however,
unable to|371151008
distinguish
between the stages|261612004
of the disease.[15]|64572001

Blood tests|252275004
are
divided|422033008
into nontreponemal
and
treponemal tests.|30345008|269814003|30345008|272393004

Nontreponemal tests|269814003|272393004
are
used|394850002
initially,|884001
and
include|55919000
venereal disease research laboratory (VDRL)|8098009|261904005
and
rapid plasma reagin tests.|19869000

However,
as
these tests|269814003|272393004
are
occasionally false positives,|90213003
confirmation|74996004
is
required
with a treponemal test,|30345008|269814003|30345008|30345008|272393004
such as treponemal pallidum particle agglutination|72904005|82383000
(TPHA
)
or
fluorescent treponemal antibody absorption test (FTA-Abs).|9232009

False positives|90213003
on the nontreponemal tests|269814003|272393004
can
occur|272120004
with some viral infections|34014006
such as varicella|38907003|19551004
and
measles,|14189004
as well as
with lymphoma,|118600007
tuberculosis,|371569005
malaria,|248437004
endocarditis,|56819008
connective tissue disease,|105969002
and
pregnancy.|289908002

Treponemal antibody|30345008|68498002|30345008|112133008
tests|269814003|272393004
usually
become
positive two to five weeks|258758003|420797005|421820001|258705008|10828004|420797005|421820001|258705008
after the initial infection.|884001|232714002

Neurosyphilis|26039008
is
diagnosed|439401001
by finding high numbers|404684003|75540009|410680006|404684003|75540009|410681005|404684003|371879000|410680006|404684003|371879000|410681005|75540009|410680006|75540009|410681005|371879000|410680006|371879000|410681005
of leukocytes|52501007
(predominately lymphocytes|83296008|56972008|83296008|446325007
and
high protein levels|75540009|365799007|371879000|365799007
in the cerebrospinal fluid|65216001
in the setting
of a known syphilis infection.[4][7]|36692007|76272004

Dark ground microscopy|391363003
of serous fluid
from a chancre|84052006
may
be
used|394850002
to
make
an immediate diagnosis.|88694003|439401001|88694003|49499008|439401001|49499008

However,
hospitals
do
not always
have
equipment|246137000
or
experienced staff members,|394852005
whereas
testing|272393004
must
be
done
within 10 minutes|259027000
of acquiring|255396000
the sample.|123038009

Sensitivity|35209006|365705006
has
been
reported|229059009|223458004
to
be
nearly 80%,
thus
can
only
be
used|394850002
to
confirm|59156000
a diagnosis|439401001
but
not
rule|10828004
one out.|421379005

Two other tests|420797005|269814003|420797005|272393004
can
be
carried|288345009
out
on a sample|123038009
from the chancre|84052006
:
direct fluorescent antibody testing|255589003|5733007|255589003|5733007|272393004|255589003|35352008|166164009
and
nucleic acid amplification tests.|69363007

Direct|255589003
fluorescent testing|35352008|35352008|272393004
uses|277889008|394850002|260676000|419385000
antibodies|68498002
tagged|201091002
with fluorescein,|85596006
which
attach|102491009
to specific syphilis proteins,|69658003|76272004|88878007
while
nucleic acid amplification|69363007
uses|277889008|394850002|260676000|419385000
techniques,|272394005
such as the polymerase chain reaction,|258066000
to
detect|260373001
the presence|386397008
of specific syphilis genes.|69658003|76272004|67271001

These tests|269814003|272393004
are
not
as
time-sensitive,|410669006|83185005
as
they
do
not
require
living bacteria to|409822003
make
the diagnosis.[8]|439401001

As of 2010[[update]]
(//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title|419205000
=Syphilis&action|76272004|129264002

)
,
there
is
no vaccine|398827000
effective|255403003|254648000
for prevention.|169443000

Abstinence|105542008
from intimate physical contact|84074000|76933008
with an infected person|125676002
is
effective|255403003|254648000
at reducing|260400001
the transmission|258150004
of syphilis,|76272004
as is
the proper use|277889008|419385000
of a latex condom.|111088007

Condom use,|277889008|419385000
however,
does
not completely
eliminate
the risk.|30207005

Thus,
the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|26216008|64572001|31509003|169443000
recommends
a long-term,
mutually monogamous relationship|225520003|272151006
with an uninfected partner|262043009
and
the avoidance
of substances|105590001
such as alcohol|419442005|53041004|430837008
and
other drugs|74964007|410942007
that
increase|260366006
risky sexual behavior.[14]|30207005|365952006

Congenital syphilis|35742006
in the newborn|133933007|46068001|255407002
can
be
prevented|116699007
by screening mothers|20135006|72705000
during early pregnancy|264499004|289908002
and
treating|28995006
those who
are
infected.

The United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) strongly|223688001|278032008|223688001|278032008|285653008
recommends
universal screening|73548004|20135006
of all pregnant women,|255409004
[18]
while
the World Health Organization|263775005|21139007
recommends
all women|224526002
be
tested|272393004
at their first antenatal visit|255216001|232714002
and
again
in the third trimester.|255248002

If
they
are
positive,|258758003|10828004
they
recommend
their partners also|262043009
be
treated.|28995006

Congenital syphilis|35742006
is
,
however,
still common|72906007
in the developing world,
as
many women|224526002
do
not
receive
antenatal care|424525001
at all,
and
the antenatal care others|424525001
do
receive
does
not
include|55919000
screening,|20135006
[17]
and
it still occasionally
occurs|272120004
in the developed world,
as
those most likely to|4757001|2931005
acquire|255396000
syphilis|76272004
(
through drug use,|246488008
etc.
)
are
least likely to|276139006|2931005|263796003|2931005
receive
care
during pregnancy.|289908002

A number|410680006|410681005
of measures to|246445000|367346004
increase|260366006
access|260507000
to testing|272393004
appear
effective|255403003|254648000
at reducing rates|260400001
of congenital syphilis|35742006
in low-|62482003|371880002
to middle-income countries.[19]|255562008|223369002|399488007|223369002

Syphilis|76272004
is
a notifiable disease|64572001
in many countries,|223369002
including|55919000
Canada[20]|223686002
the European Union,|414152003
[21]
and
the United States.|223688001

This means health care providers|255586005
are
required
to
notify|185087000
public health authorities,|394747008
which
will
then ideally
provide
partner notification|262043009|185087000
to the person's partners.|125676002|262043009

[23] Physicians|264657009|309343006
may
also
encourage
patients to|116154003
send
their partners to|262043009
seek
care.

The CDC
recommends

Ceftriaxone,|372670001
a third-generation cephalosporin antibiotic,|372859005|255631004

be
as
effective|255403003|254648000
as penicillin-based treatment.[4]|373270004|276239002|373270004|416118004|373270004|418836005|276239002|373270004|418836005|416118004|276239002|416118004|418836005|276239002|418836005|416118004

For neurosyphilis,|26039008
due to the poor penetration|11403006|53568006|255351007|53568006
of penicillin G|78507004
into the central nervous system,|21483005|278199004
those affected|247591002|248448006
are
recommended
to
be
given|419582001
large doses|255509001|277406006
of intravenous penicillin|373270004|255560000|373270004|255560000
for a minimum|255605001|255604002
of 10 days.|258703001

If
a person|125676002
is
allergic, ceftriaxone|372670001

for three weeks.|421291004|258705008

If allergic,
as
in the case|398241000
of early disease,|264499004|64572001
doxycycline|372478003
or
tetracycline|372809001|16355005|282831004
may
be
used|394850002
,
albeit
for a longer duration.|260384008

Treatment|276239002|416118004
at this stage|21191007|371508000|261612004
limits|255469002
further progression,|46053002|246453008|46053002|246450006
but
has
only slight effect|50607009|255510006|253861007|50607009|255604002|253861007|420295001|255510006|253861007|420295001|255604002|253861007
on damage|37782003
which
has
already
occurred.[4]|272120004

One|421379005
of the potential side effects|30207005
of treatment|276239002|416118004
is
the Jarisch-Herxheimer reaction.|10803007

It frequently|70232002
starts|255395001|385652002
within one hour|421379005|258702006|421379005|286551008
and
lasts
for 24 hours,|123027009|259029002
with symptoms
of fever,|386661006
muscles|91727004
pains|22253000
,
headache,|25064002
and
tachycardia.|3424008|6285003

It
is
caused|23981006|134198009
by cytokines|75777003
released|68776005|129299003
by the immune system|116003000
in response
to lipoproteins|301861005
released|68776005|129299003
from rupturing syphilis bacteria.[27]|415747007|76272004|409822003|263862003|76272004|409822003

Syphilis|76272004
is
believed to
have
infected
12 million people|125676002
in 1999,
with greater|263768009
than 90%|264705001|264703008
of cases|398241000|413769002
in the developing world.

It
affects|4065008
between 700,000
and
1.6 million pregnancies|260305007|289908002
a year,|258707000|259039008
resulting|42752001
in spontaneous abortions,|17369002
stillbirths,|237364002
and
congenital syphilis.|35742006

In sub-Saharan Africa,|409988000
syphilis|76272004
contributes
to approximately 20%|26175008
of perinatal deaths.|10588007

Rates
are
proportionally higher|75540009|371879000
among intravenous drug users,|228388006
those
who
are
infected
with HIV,|19030005|86406008|402916007
and
men|339947000
who
have
sex|258139002|365952006|263495000|70256003|57312000
with men.|339947000

In the United States,|223688001
rates
of syphilis|76272004
as of 2007
were
six|422218008
times greater|263768009
in men|339947000
than women,|224526002
while
they
were
nearly equal|9726003
in 1997.

African Americans|15086000
accounted
for almost half
of all cases|398241000|413769002
in 2010.[30]

Syphilis|76272004
was
very common|260358002|72906007
is
Europe|223502009
during the 18th
and
19th centuries.

In the developed world
during the early 20th century,|264499004
infections
declined
rapidly|418694008
with the widespread use|85333001|277889008|85333001|419385000
of antibiotics,|255631004
until
the 1980s
and
1990s.

Since
the year 2000,|258707000|259039008
rates
of syphilis|76272004
have
been
increasing|260369004
in the USA,|223688001
Canada,|223686002
the UK,
Australia|223621005
and
Europe,|223502009
primarily
among men|339947000
who
have
sex|258139002|365952006|263495000|70256003|57312000
with men.|339947000

Rates
of syphilis|76272004
among American women|224526002
have
,
however,
remained
stable|58158008
during this time,|410669006
and
rates
among UK women|224526002
have
increased|35105006|260366006
,
but
at a rate less
than that
of men.|339947000

Increased rates|35105006|260366006
among heterosexuals|20430005
have
occurred|272120004
in China|223581004
and
Russia|223656009
since
the 1990s.

This
has
been
attributed|246061005
to
unsafe
sexual practices,|365952006
such as sexual promiscuity,|365952006|85892000
prostitution,|53713009
and
decreasing use|260371004|277889008|260371004|419385000
of barrier protection.[5][32][31]|264664006

Untreated|25265005
,
it
has
a mortality|409651001
of 8%
to 58%,
with a greater death rate|263768009|409651001
in males.|248153007

The symptoms
of syphilis|76272004
have
become
less severe|276139006|24484000|263796003|24484000
over the 19th
and
20th centuries,
in part|260726005
due to widespread availability|85333001|103328004
of effective treatment|255403003|276239002|255403003|416118004|254648000|276239002|254648000|416118004
and
partly
due to decreasing virulence|260371004
of the spirochaete.|38732005|115169007|418489004

With early treatment,|264499004|276239002|264499004|416118004
few complications|57176003|116223007
result.|394617004

Syphilis|76272004
increases|260366006
the risk|30207005
of HIV transmission|19030005|258150004|86406008|258150004|402916007|258150004
by two to five times,|420797005|421820001|410669006|420797005|421820001|417929005
and
coinfection
is
common|72906007
(30?60%
in a number|410680006|410681005
of urban centers|224807002|26216008
).[4][5]|264676006

The exact origin|255395001
of syphilis|76272004
is
unknown.|261665006

Of two primary hypotheses,|420797005|63161005|420797005|261424001
one|421379005
proposes
syphilis|76272004
was
carried|288345009
to Europe|223502009
by the
returning|7528007
crewmen
from Christopher Columbus's voyage
to the Americas,
the other|74964007
proposes
syphilis|76272004
existed
in Europe previously,|223502009
but
went
unrecognized.

These
are
referred|439980006
to
as
the "Columbian"
and
"pre-Columbian" hypotheses,|236874000|272113006
respectively.

The Columbian hypothesis
is
best|20572008|3442003
supported|9096001|243114000
by the available evidence.|103328004|18669006

The first written records|255216001|12261009|232714002|12261009
of an outbreak|443684005
of syphilis|76272004
in Europe|223502009
occurred|272120004
in 1494/1495
in Naples,
Italy,|223668000
during a French invasion.|19434008|370052007

Due to its
being
spread|410677005
by
returning|7528007
French troops,|19434008
it
was
initially|884001
known|36692007
as the "French disease."|19434008|64572001
In 1530,
the name "syphilis"|76272004
was
first|255216001|232714002
used|394850002
by the Italian physician|297502002|309343006|31637002|309343006
and
poet Girolamo Fracastoro
as the title
of his Latin poem
in dactylic hexameter
describing
the ravages
of the disease|64572001
in Italy.|223668000

It
was
also
known|36692007
historically
as the "Great Pox".[37][38]|76272004|264670000

The causative organism,|410653004
_Treponema pallidum_,|72904005
was
first|255216001|232714002
identified|7882003
by Fritz Schaudinn
and
Erich Hoffmann
in 1905.

The first effective treatment|255216001|255403003|276239002|255216001|255403003|416118004|255216001|254648000|276239002|255216001|254648000|416118004|232714002|255403003|276239002|232714002|255403003|416118004|232714002|254648000|276239002|232714002|254648000|416118004
(Salvarsan
was
developed
in 1910
by Paul Ehrlich,
which
was
followed|367409002
by trials|110465008
of penicillin|373270004
and
confirmation|74996004
of its effectiveness|255403003
in 1943.

Before the advent
of effective treatment,|255403003|276239002|255403003|416118004|254648000|276239002|254648000|416118004
mercury|45262002
and
isolation|40174006|46651001
were
commonly
used|394850002
,
with treatments|276239002
often worse|70232002|230993007|70232002|390772001|70232002|231877006
than the disease.|64572001

Many famous historical figures,|392521001
including|55919000
Franz Schubert,
Arthur Schopenhauer
and ?douard Manet[13]
are
believed
to
have
had
the disease.|64572001

The earliest known depiction|264499004|36692007
of an individual|125676002|385435006
with syphilis|76272004
is
Albrecht D?rer's _Syphilitic Man_,|24155001|263891000|248153007|24155001|263891000|339947000|24155001|263891000|278412004
a woodcut
believed
to
represent
a Landsknecht,
a Northern European mercenary.|414152003

The myth
of the _femme fatale_
or
"poison women"|35331000|224526002
of the 19th century
is
believed to
be
partly
derived
from the devastation
of syphilis,|76272004
with classic examples|255333006
in literature
including|55919000
John Keats' _La Belle Dame sans Merci_.[40][41]|259031006

The artist Jan van der Straet|159062006|224832000
painted|36864000
a scene
of a wealthy man receiving treatment|224166006|248153007|276239002|224166006|248153007|416118004|224166006|339947000|276239002|224166006|339947000|416118004|224166006|278412004|276239002|224166006|278412004|416118004
for syphilis|76272004
with the tropical wood guaiacum sometime|14402002|8735004
around 1580.

The title
of the work|261041009
is
"Preparation|225106003
and
Use|277889008|419385000
of Guayaco
for Treating Syphilis".|28995006|76272004

That
the artist|159062006
chose
to
include|55919000
this image
in a series|13039001
of works|261041009
celebrating
the New World|7147002
indicates|410535002
how important
a treatment,|276239002|416118004
however ineffective,
for syphilis|76272004
was
to the European elite|414152003
at
that time.|410669006

The richly
colored|103366001
and
detailed work|261041009
depicts
four servants|421534005
preparing
the concoction
while
a physician looks|309343006|386548000
on,
hiding|6080000|421332005
something
behind his
back
while
the hapless patient drinks.[43]|116154003|226465004

One|421379005
of the most infamous United States cases|4757001|223688001|398241000|4757001|223688001|413769002
of questionable medical ethics|42425007|74188005
in the 20th century
was
the Tuskegee syphilis study.|76272004|110465008|76272004|224699009

The study|110465008|224699009
took|419652001
place|257557008|421066005
in Tuskegee,
Alabama,|224038000
and
was
supported|9096001|243114000
by the [U.S.|223688001

Public Health Service]|310115006
(/wiki/U.S._Public_Health_Service|223688001|310115006
)
(PHS|56677004
)
in partnership
with the Tuskegee Institute.|385437003

The study|110465008|224699009
began|255395001
in 1932,
when
syphilis|76272004
was
a widespread problem|85333001|55607006
and
there
was
no safe
and
effective treatment.|255403003|276239002|255403003|416118004|254648000|276239002|254648000|416118004

The study|110465008|224699009
was
designed
to
measure|246445000|272391002
the progression|246453008|246450006
of untreated syphilis.|25265005|76272004

By 1947,
penicillin|373270004
had
been
validated
as an effective cure|255403003|254648000
for syphilis|76272004
and
was
becoming
widely
used|394850002
to
treat|395077000
the disease.|64572001

Study directors,|110465008|224699009
however,
continued|255238004
the study|110465008|224699009
and
did
not
offer|410527000
the participants treatment|276239002|416118004
with penicillin.|373270004

This
is
debated,
and
some
have
found|404684003
that penicillin|373270004
was
given|419582001
to many|260396001
of the subjects.

The study|110465008|224699009
did
not
end|261782000|422117008
until 1972.[45]

Syphilis experiments|76272004
were
also
carried|288345009
out
in Guatemala|223693003
from 1946
to 1948.

They
were
United States-sponsored human experiments,|223688001|278412004
conducted|844005
during the government
of Juan Jos?
Ar?valo
with the cooperation
of some Guatemalan health ministries|263775005
and
officials.

Doctors|309343006
infected
soldiers,
prisoners,
and
mental patients|116154003
with syphilis|76272004
and
other sexually transmitted diseases,|74964007|8098009
without the informed consent|410938009|441898007|223458004|441898007
of the subjects,
and
then
treated|28995006
them
with antibiotics.|255631004

In October 2010,
the U.S.|223688001

formally
apologized
to Guatemala|223693003
for conducting|844005
these experiments.[46]
