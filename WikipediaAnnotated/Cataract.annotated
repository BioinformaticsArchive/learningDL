A
*
*cataract|247053007
*
*
is
a clouding
that
develops
in the crystalline lens|78076003
of the eye|81745001|244486005
or
in its envelope
(lens capsule,|77155007|244500004
varying
in degree|258395000|246173007
from slight to|255510006|255604002
complete|255594003
opacity|125149003|128305008
and
obstructing|263821009
the passage|255592004
of light.|56242006|371268001

Early|264499004
in the development|278923009
of age-related cataract,|39450006
the power|33300005
of the lens|78076003|181169005
may
be
increased|35105006|260366006
,
causing|23981006
near-sightedness|57190000
(myopia,|57190000
and
the gradual yellowing|255343009|263935005
and
opacification|263506008
of the lens|78076003|181169005
may
reduce|260400001
the perception|81742003
of blue colors.|405738005

Cataracts typically|247053007|95722004
progress|385651009
slowly to|419443000
cause|23981006|134198009
vision loss,
and
are
potentially
blinding
if
untreated.|25265005

The condition usually|260905004
affects|4065008
both
eyes,|81745001
but
almost always one eye|421379005|81745001|421379005|244486005
is
affected earlier|247591002|264499004|248448006|264499004
than the other.[1]|74964007

A
*
*senile cataract|39450006
*
*,
occurring|272120004
in the elderly,|105436006
is
characterized
by an initial opacity|884001|125149003|884001|128305008|232714002|125149003|232714002|128305008
in the lens,|78076003|181169005
subsequent swelling|255260001|423666004|255260001|442672001
of the lens|78076003|181169005
and
final shrinkage|42796001|73238002
with complete loss|255594003
of transparency.|300828005

Moreover,
with time|410669006
the cataract cortex|247053007|40146001
liquefies
to
form|246176004
a milky white fluid|263811001|413773004|32457005|263811001|413773004|33463005|263811001|413773004|255765007|263811001|413773004|263811001|185984009|32457005|263811001|185984009|33463005|263811001|185984009|255765007|263811001|185984009|263811001|371251000|32457005|263811001|371251000|33463005|263811001|371251000|255765007|263811001|371251000
in a
*
*Morgagnian cataract|264443002
*
*,
which
can
cause|23981006|134198009
severe inflammation|103624008
if
the lens capsule ruptures|77155007|415747007|244500004|415747007
and
leaks.|87952002

Untreated|25265005
,
the cataract|247053007
can
cause|23981006|134198009
phacomorphic glaucoma.|392300000

Very advanced cataracts|260358002|86005002|247053007|260358002|86005002|95722004
with weak zonules|13791008|260407003
are
liable
to dislocation anteriorly|108367008
or
posteriorly.

Such spontaneous posterior dislocations|125177007|255551008|5054005|125172001
(akin
to the historical surgical procedure|83578000|392521001|83578000
of couching
)
in ancient times|410669006|417929005
were
regarded
as a blessing
from the heavens,
because
some perception|81742003
of light|56242006|371268001
was
restored
in the cataractous patients.|247053007|116154003|95722004|116154003

Some children|410601007|160499008
develop
cataracts,|247053007|95722004
called
*
*congenital cataract|79410001
*
*,
before
or
just after birth|3950001
;
these
are
usually
dealt
with differently
from cataracts|247053007|95722004
in adults.[3]|133936004

As a cataract|247053007
becomes
more opaque,|242762006|125149003|242762006|134295003
clear vision|263707001|281004000
is
compromised.

A loss
of visual acuity|363983007
is
noted.

Contrast sensitivity|251686008
is
also
lost
,
so
contours,
shadows|39321000
and
color vision|61409007
are
less
vivid.|371265003

Veiling glare|228245000|64445006
can
be
a problem,|55607006
as
light|56242006|371268001
is
scattered|255393008
by the cataract|247053007
into the eye.|81745001|244486005

The affected eye|247591002|81745001|247591002|244486005|248448006|81745001|248448006|244486005
will
have
an absent red reflex.|37280007|386713009|37280007|371240000|2667000|43408002

A contrast sensitivity test|410566008
should
be
performed|398166005
,
and
if
a loss
is
demonstrated,
an eye specialist consultation|81745001|309395003|11429006|244486005|309395003|11429006
is
recommended.

It
may
be
advisable to
seek
medical opinion,|74188005
particularly
in high-risk|15508007
groups|261586004|160481000
such as diabetics,
if
a "halo"|83551002
is
observed
around street lights|224823002
at night,|2546009
especially
if
this phenomenon
appears
to
be
confined
to one eye only.|421379005|81745001|421379005|244486005

The symptoms
of cataracts|247053007|95722004
are
very similar|260358002
to the symptoms
of ocular citrosis.|81745001|281004000

Several factors|261028005
can
promote
the formation|11798007|255277001
of cataracts,|247053007|95722004
including|55919000
long-term exposure|71677004|24932003
to ultraviolet light,|41355003
exposure|71677004|24932003
to ionizing radiation,|125576007
secondary effects|2603003|253861007|81170007|253861007
of diseases|64572001
such as diabetes,|73211009
hypertension|38341003
and
advanced age,|105436006
or
trauma
(possibly much earlier|60022001|264499004
)
;
they
are
usually
a result|394617004
of denaturation|40241000
of lens protein.|42076001

Genetic factors|3950001|255395001
are
often|70232002
a cause|134198009
of congenital cataract,|79410001
and
positive family history|258758003|57177007|10828004|57177007
may
also
play|300776002
a role
in predisposing
someone
to cataracts|247053007|95722004
at an earlier age,|264499004|424144002
a phenomenon
of "anticipation"
in presenile cataracts.|441622000

Cataracts|247053007|95722004
may
also
be
produced
by eye injury
or
physical trauma.|5880005|5880005|19388002|19388002

Atopic|115665000
or
allergic conditions|260905004
are
also
known|36692007
to
quicken|11337002
the progression|246453008|246450006
of cataracts,|247053007|95722004
especially
in children.|410601007|160499008

Cataracts|247053007|95722004
can
also
be
caused|23981006|134198009
by iodine deficiency.[5]|237562002

Some drugs|410942007
can
induce|16404004
cataract development,|247053007|278923009
such as corticosteroids[6]|79440004
and
the antipsychotic drug quetiapine.|372482001|386850001

The increase|260366006
in ultraviolet radiation|41355003
resulting|42752001
from depletion|69251000
of the ozone layer|40057008
is
expected to
increase|260366006
the incidence
of cataracts.|247053007|95722004

A study|110465008|224699009
among Icelandair pilots|308040008
showed
commercial airline pilots|308040008
are
three times more likely to|421291004|410669006|2931005|421291004|417929005|2931005
develop
cataracts|247053007|95722004
than people|125676002
with nonflying jobs.|14679004

This
is
thought to|88952004
be
caused|23981006|134198009
by excessive exposure|260378005|71677004|260378005|24932003
at high altitudes|87588000
to radiation coming|30821001|82107009|108290001
from outer space,|261074009
which
becomes
attenuated|24588000
by atmospheric absorption
at ground level.|15537006|258395000|15537006|276625007

Supporting|9096001|243114000
this theory
is
the report|229059009|223458004
that 36
of the 39 astronauts
involved|248448006
in high-radiation-mission,|75540009|30821001|75540009|82107009|75540009|108290001|371879000|30821001|371879000|82107009|371879000|108290001
such as the nine Apollo missions to|422113007
leave|7771000|90737002
Earth orbit,|363654007|181143004
have
developed
early|264499004
stage|21191007|371508000|261612004
cataracts|247053007|95722004
that
have
been
shown
to
be
caused|23981006|134198009
by exposure|71677004|24932003
to cosmic rays|46316000
during their trips.|75941004

Cataracts|247053007|95722004
are
also unusually common|72906007
in persons|125676002
exposed|24932003
to infrared radiation,|17871006
such as glassblowers,|62804008
who
suffer
from exfoliation syndrome.|111514006

Exposure|71677004|24932003
to microwave radiation|64285002
can
cause|23981006|134198009
cataracts_[citation|247053007|95722004
needed|410525008|103325001
_].

Cataracts|247053007|95722004
may
be
partial|255609007
or
complete, stationary|255594003|255323003
or
progressive,|255314001
or
hard|72505002
or
soft.|37378003

The various types|256220008|261664005
of cataracts|247053007|95722004
are
nuclear, cortical, mature,|84640000|68594002|34071009|84640000|40146001|34071009|84640000|50403003|34071009
and
hypermature.|264020004

Cataracts|247053007|95722004
are
also
classified|73504009
by their location,|246267002
e.g.|258795003

posterior|255551008
(classically
due to steroid use|116566001|277889008|116566001|419385000
)
[6][12]|260274009
and
anterior|255549009
(common|72906007
(senile) cataract|39450006
related|272151006|262094002
to aging|248280005
).

The following|255260001
is
a classification|73504009
of the various types|256220008|261664005
of cataracts.|247053007|95722004

This
is
not comprehensive,
and
other unusual types|74964007|261664005
may
be
noted.

Although
cataracts|247053007|95722004
have
no scientifically proven prevention,|277025001|169443000
wearing
ultraviolet-protecting sunglasses|415770004|420299007
may
slow|419443000
the development|278923009
of cataracts.|247053007|95722004

It
has
been
suggested
that regular intake|17854005
of antioxidants
(
such as vitamins|87708000
A,
C
and
E
)
is
helpful,
but
taking
them
as
a supplement|373453009
has
not
been
shown
to
have
a benefit.[16]

Although
statins|372912004
are
known|36692007
for their ability to|371150009
lower|261122009
lipids,|70106000
they
are
also
believed
to
have
antioxidant qualities.|263496004

Oxidative stress|262188008
is
believed to
play|300776002
a role
in the development|278923009
of nuclear cataracts,|53889007
which
are
the most common type|4757001|72906007|261664005
of age-related cataracts.|39450006

To
explore
the relationship|272151006
between nuclear cataracts|53889007
and
statin use,|372912004|277889008|372912004|419385000
a group|261586004|160481000|389109008

of 1299 patients|116154003
who
were
at risk|410519009
of developing nuclear cataracts|53889007
with statins.|372912004

Their results|394617004
suggest
statin use|372912004|277889008|372912004|419385000
in an at-risk population|410519009|385436007|410519009|389109008
may
be
associated|47429007
with a lower risk|261122009|30207005
of developing nuclear cataract disease.[17]_[better source|53889007|64572001|3442003|260753009

In 1960 Svyatoslav Fyodorov
performed|398166005
the first intraocular lens replacement operation,|255216001|69724002|3137001|83578000|255216001|69724002|282089006|83578000|255216001|313236002|3137001|83578000|255216001|313236002|282089006|83578000|255216001|3137001|83578000|255216001|282089006|83578000|232714002|69724002|3137001|83578000|232714002|69724002|282089006|83578000|232714002|313236002|3137001|83578000|232714002|313236002|282089006|83578000|232714002|3137001|83578000|232714002|282089006|83578000
inventing
the cure
to the cataract|247053007
;
all
the modern treatments|276239002
start|255395001
from here.

Topical treatment|276239002|416118004|359540000|276239002|359540000|416118004

has
been

in randomized controlled clinical trials to|31509003|110465008
improve|385425000|3442003|385633008

with cataracts.|247053007|95722004

After animal experiments researchers|387961004
of a pharmaceutical company|421967003
have
proposed N-acetylcarnosine
as a treatment|276239002|416118004

cataracts,|247053007|95722004
glaucoma,|23986001
retinal degeneration,|95695004
corneal disorders,|15250008

no longer|255511005
a reason to|410666004
wait
until a cataract|247053007
is
"ripe"
before
removing|127485006
it.

However,
because
all surgery|83578000
involves|248448006
some risk,|30207005
it
is
usually
worth waiting
until
there
is
some change|243326001|263703002
in vision|281004000
before removing|127485006
the cataract.|247053007

The risk|30207005
of infective endophthalmitis|1847009
following|255260001
extraction|62972009
is
about
one|421379005
in 1000.[22]

The most effective|4757001|255403003|4757001|254648000
and
common treatment|72906007|276239002|72906007|416118004
is
to
make
an incision|34896006
(capsulotomy
)
into the capsule|385049006|428641000
of the cloudy lens|81858005|78076003|81858005|181169005
to surgically|83578000
remove|127485006
it.

Two types|420797005|261664005
of eye surgery|422191005
can
be
used|394850002
to
remove|127485006
cataracts|247053007|95722004
:
extracapsular cataract extraction (ECCE)|13793006
and
intracapsular cataract extraction (ICCE).|404628003

ECCE surgery|83578000
consists
of removing|127485006
the lens,|78076003|181169005
but
leaving|7771000|90737002
the majority
of the lens capsule|77155007|244500004
intact.|11163003

High frequency sound waves|27732004
(phacoemulsification|84149000
are
sometimes
used|394850002
to break up|255532002|353734004
the lens|78076003|181169005
before extraction.|62972009

Intra-capsular|272114000|11070000
(ICCE|404628003
)
surgery|83578000
involves|248448006
removing|127485006
the lens|78076003|181169005
and
lens capsule,|77155007|244500004
but
it
is
rarely|103356009
performed|398166005
in modern practice.

In
either
extracapsular surgery|83578000
or
intracapsular surgery,|83578000
the cataractous lens|247053007|78076003|247053007|181169005|95722004|78076003|95722004|181169005
is
removed|127485006
and
replaced|282089006|370124000
with a plastic lens|424337000
(
an intraocular lens implant|69724002|313236002
)
which
stays
in the eye permanently.|81745001|244486005

Cataract operations|247053007|83578000
are
usually
performed|398166005
using|260676000
a local anaesthetic,|386761002|373477003
and
the patient|116154003
is
allowed to
go
home|261770009
the same day.|262126009|258703001|262126009|259032004

Until the early twenty-first century intraocular lenses|264499004|255216001|69724002|264499004|255216001|313236002|264499004|232714002|69724002|264499004|232714002|313236002
were
always monofocal
;
since then improvements
in intraocular technology
allow
implanting|71861002
a multifocal lens to|397283008
create
a visual environment|255374006|276339004
in which patients|116154003
are
less dependent|276139006|371154000|263796003|371154000
on glasses.|50121007

Such multifocal lenses|397283008
are
mechanically flexible|261012000
and
can
be
controlled|31509003
using|260676000
the eye muscles|67833000
used|394850002
to
control|31509003
the natural lens.|510009|78076003|510009|181169005

Complications|116223007
are
possible after cataract surgery,|371930009|47337003|83578000|60022001|47337003|83578000
including|55919000
endophthalmitis,|1847009
posterior capsular opacification|410567004
and
retinal detachment.|42059000

Laser surgery|35631009
involves|248448006
cutting away|70302008|410717008
a small circle-shaped area|255507004|42700002|42798000|255507004|112627000|42798000
of the lens capsule,|77155007|244500004
enough to
allow
light to|56242006|371268001
pass
directly
through the eye|81745001|244486005
to the retina.|5665001|181171005

There
are
,
as
always,
some risks,|30207005
but
serious side effects|42745003
are
very rare.|260358002|84638005|260358002|103356009

for cataract surgery.[25]|54885007|422349000|110473004

Age-related cataracts|39450006
are
responsible|394851003
for 48%
of world blindness,
which
represents
about 18 million people.|125676002

Globally cataracts|247053007|95722004
causes|134198009
moderate|6736007
to severe disability|24484000|21134002
in 53.8 million people|125676002
as of 2004
(52.2 million
of whom
are
in low|62482003|371880002
and
middle income countries|255562008|223369002|399488007|223369002
).[28]

In many countries,|223369002
surgical services|310138009
are
inadequate,|71978007
and
cataracts|247053007|95722004
remain
the leading cause|236874000|134198009
of blindness.

As populations age,|385436007|424144002
the number|410680006|410681005
of people|125676002
with cataracts|247053007|95722004
is
growing.

Cataracts|247053007|95722004
are
also
an important cause|134198009
of low vision|397540003
in
both
developed
and
developing countries.|223369002

Even
where surgical services|310138009
are
available, low vision|103328004|397540003
associated|47429007
with cataracts|247053007|95722004
may
still
be
prevalent,
as
a result|394617004
of long waits|255511005
for operations|83578000
and
barriers
to surgical uptake,|83578000|258763004
such as cost,
lack|41277001
of information
and
transportation problems.|55607006

in Ancient Rome
are
found|404684003
in 29 CE
in _
De Medicinae_,

The Muslim ophthalmologist Ammar ibn Ali,|271390004|422234006|309884000|422234006
in his _Choice
of Eye Diseases_,|371405004
written circa 1000 CE,|12261009
wrote|12261009
of his invention
of a syringe|61968008
and
the technique|272394005
of cataract extraction|54885007
while
experimenting
with it
on a patient.[34]|116154003

_Cataract_ derives|247053007
from the Latin _cataracta_ meaning "waterfall"|247053007|285096004|95722004|285096004
and
that
from the Greek ??????????|1451003
(_katarakt?s_)
or ???????????
(_katarrhakt?s_
)
,
"
down-rushing",|262118001
[35]
from ?????????
(_katarass?_
)
meaning "
to dash
down"[36]
(
from _kata_-,
"
down"
; _arassein_,
"to
strike|89098005
,
dash"
).

As
rapidly running water|418694008|257451007
turns|282987006
white,|413773004|185984009|371251000
the term
may
later
have
been
used|394850002
metaphorically to
describe
the similar appearance|386548000|255412001
of mature ocular opacities.|34071009|81745001|125149003|34071009|81745001|128305008|34071009|281004000|125149003|34071009|281004000|128305008|34071009|125149003|34071009|128305008

In Latin,
_cataracta_|247053007|95722004
had
the alternate meaning "portcullis"[39]|49572008
and
the name possibly|60022001
passed
through French to|19434008
form|246176004
the English meaning "eye disease"|297487008|371405004|25804004|371405004
(early 15th century|264499004
)
,
on the notion
of "obstruction".|26036001

Early Persian physicians|264499004|309343006
called
the term _nazul-i-ah_,|42146005|22971001
or
"descent
of the water"?|11713004|119318008
vulgarised
into waterfall disease|285096004|64572001
or
cataract?|247053007
believing
such blindness to
be
caused|23981006|134198009
by an outpouring
of corrupt humour|386325009
into the eye.[41]|81745001|244486005

Research
is
scant
and
mixed,|26242008
but
weakly positive,|260408008
for the nutrients lutein|226355009|422048002
and
zeaxanthin.[42][43][44][45]

In the early 2000s eye drops|264499004|385125006
containing|42504009
N-acetylcarnosine|258310009
have
been
used|394850002
by several thousands|261028005
of cataract patients|247053007|116154003
across the world.

The drops|426684005|404218003
are
believed
to
work|261041009
by reducing oxidation|260400001|26694004
and
glycation damage|37782003
in the lens,|78076003|181169005
particularly
reducing|260400001
crystallin crosslinking.|42076001|85952003

Randomized controlled trials|31509003|110465008
indicate|410535002
the drops|426684005|404218003
may
be
especially appropriate
for seniors,
or
others|74964007

is
not
advised.[48]|424900004
