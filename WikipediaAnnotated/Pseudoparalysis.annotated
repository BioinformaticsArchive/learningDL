*Paralysis|44695005
*
*
is
loss
of muscle function|78718001
for one|421379005
or
more muscles.|242762006|91727004

Paralysis|44695005
can
be
accompanied
by a loss
of feeling|285854004
(sensory loss|33653009
)
in the affected area|247591002|42798000|248448006|42798000
if
there
is
sensory damage|262139008|37782003
as well as
motor.

A study|110465008|224699009
conducted|844005
by the Christopher & Dana Reeve Foundation,|418836005
suggests
that
about 1|260305007
in 50 people|125676002
have
been
diagnosed|439401001
with paralysis.|44695005

[1]|260305007
The word|255373000
comes
from the Greek ?????????,|1451003
"disabling
of the nerves",|3057000

itself

Paralysis|44695005
is
most often|4757001|70232002
caused|23981006|134198009
by damage|37782003
in the nervous system,|25087005|278196006
especially
the spinal cord.|2748008|180959008

Other major causes|74964007|255603008|134198009
are
stroke,|230690007
trauma
with nerve injury,|57182000
poliomyelitis,|398102009
botulism,|414531002
spina bifida,|67531005
multiple sclerosis,|24700007
and
Guillain-Barr? syndrome.

Temporary paralysis|14803004|44695005
occurs|272120004
during REM sleep,|89129007
and
dysregulation
of this system|246333005
can
lead|88488004
to episodes|272128006
of waking paralysis.|255377004|44695005

Drugs|410942007
that
interfere|78235001
with nerve function,|3057000|246464006|256864008|246464006
such as curare,|77515003
can
also
cause|23981006|134198009
paralysis.|44695005

There
are
many known causes|260396001|36692007|134198009
for paralysis,|44695005
and
perhaps more yet to
be
discovered.

_Pseudoparalysis_|135834002
(_pseudo-_ meaning "false,|64100000|64100000
not
genuine
",
from Greek ??????[6]|1451003
)
is
voluntary restriction|255375007|263856008
or
inhibition|61511001|419495008
of motion|56219004
because of pain,|22253000
incoordination,|281016006
orgasm,|37690006
or
other cause,|74964007|134198009
and
is
not
due to actual muscular paralysis.

In an infant,|418119000
it
may
be
a symptom
of congenital syphilis.[8]|35742006

Paralysis|44695005
can
occur|272120004
in localised|255471002
or
generalised forms,|60132005|246176004
or
it
may
follow|367409002|421939007
a certain pattern.|17162000|272135003

Most paralyses|44695005
caused|23981006|134198009
by nervous-system damage|128239009
(i.e.|42146005|22971001

spinal-cord injuries|90584004
are
constant
in nature|277302009
;
however,
some
forms|246176004
of periodic paralysis,|267607008|198030008
including|55919000
sleep paralysis,|277180005
are
caused|23981006|134198009
by other factors.|74964007

*
*Ascending paralysis|193174005
*
*
presents|52101004|246105001
in the lower limbs|61685007
before the upper limbs.|53120007

It
can
be
associated|47429007
with
:

Ascending paralysis|193174005
contrasts|263543005
with
*
*descending paralysis|75294000|44695005
*
*,
which
occurs|272120004
in conditions|260905004
such as botulism.|414531002

Many animal species|260396001|387961004|69658003
use|277889008|419385000
paralyzing toxins to|44695005|80917008
capture
prey,
evade predication,
or
both.

It
was
shown
that
in stimulated muscles|91727004
the decrease|260400001|260370003
in frequency|260864003|272123002
of the miniature potentials|30207005
runs|282476009
parallel
to the decrease|260400001|260370003
in postsynaptic potential|30207005
as well as
to the decrease|260400001|260370003
in muscle contraction.|12140005

This clearly
indicates|410535002
that Microbracon venom|37663002
causes|134198009
paralysis|44695005
of the neuromuscular system|246333005
by
acting
at a presynaptic site.|10546003

Philanthus venom|37663002
inhibits|61511001
the fast|16985007|277748003
as well as
the slow neuromuscular system|419443000|246333005
at identical concentrations.|20323000|82742001

It
causes|134198009
a decrease|260400001|260370003
in the frequency|260864003|272123002
of the miniature potentials|30207005
without affecting|247591002|248448006
their amplitude significantly

Some species|69658003
of wasp,|88030006
to
complete|255594003
the reproductive cycle,|44180009
the female wasp|248152002|88030006|224526002|88030006
paralyses|44695005
a prey item
such as a grasshopper
and
places|257557008
it
in her nest.

She then
lays
eggs|102263004
in the paralysed insect,|44695005|106763003
which
is
devoured
by the larvae
when
they hatch.

A well-known example|20572008|36692007
is
the tetrodotoxin|59149006
of fish species|90580008|69658003
such as _Takifugu rubripes_,|21434006
the famously lethal pufferfish|286860006
of Japanese fugu.|414551003|21434006

This toxin|80917008
works|261041009
by binding|257768005
to sodium channels|39972003|255592004
in nerve cells,|47220008
preventing|116699007
the cells' proper function.|4421005|246464006

A non-lethal dose|409644005
of this toxin|80917008
results|394617004
in temporary paralysis.|14803004|44695005

This toxin|80917008
is
also
present|52101004|246105001
in many other species|74964007|69658003
ranging
from toads|84903005
to nemerteans.

Paralysis|44695005
can
be
seen
in breeds
of dogs|448771007
that
are
chondrodysplastic.|205465004

These dogs|448771007
have
short legs,|249786007
and
may
also
have
short muzzles.|359530003|41127006|367450005|41127006

Their intervertebral disc material|360499006|260769002|244570000|260769002
can
calcify
and
become
more brittle.|242762006|255299009

In such cases,|398241000|413769002
the disc
may
rupture|415747007
,
with disc material ending|260769002|261782000|260769002|422117008
up
in the spinal canal,|61853006
or
rupturing more laterally to|415747007|263862003
press
on spinal nerves.|3169005

A minor rupture|410599005|415747007|255606000|415747007
may
only
result|394617004
in paresis,
but
a major rupture|255603008|415747007
can
cause|23981006|134198009
enough
damage|37782003
to cut off circulation.|283396008|413854007

If
no signs|72670004
of pain|22253000
can
be
elicited|263516000
,
surgery|83578000
should
be
performed|398166005
within 24 hours|123027009|259029002
of the incident,
to
remove|127485006
the disc material|260769002
and
relieve|397855004
pressure|279046003|13543005|257893003
on the spinal cord.|2748008|180959008

After 24 hours,|123027009|259029002
the chance
of recovery
declines
rapidly,|418694008
since
with continued pressure,|255238004|279046003|255238004|13543005|255238004|257893003
the spinal cord tissue deteriorates|2748008|85756007|180959008|85756007
and
dies.

Another type|261664005
of paralysis|44695005
is
caused|23981006|134198009
by a fibrocartilaginous embolism.|91685003|414086009|91685003|55584005

This
is
a microscopic piece|84496004
of disc material|260769002
that breaks
off
and
becomes
lodged|414418009
in a spinal artery.|244228006

Nerves|3057000
served
by the artery|51114001|11527006
will
die|419620001|399069006|419099009
when
deprived
of blood.|87612001|119273009

The German Shepherd|42252000
is
especially prone|1240000
to developing degenerative myelopathy.|70350007

This
is
a deterioration
of nerves|3057000
in the spinal cord,|2748008|180959008
starting|255395001|385652002
in the posterior part|255551008|260726005
of the cord.

Dogs so|448771007
affected|247591002|248448006
will
become
gradually weaker|13791008|260407003
in the hind legs|30021000
as nerves die off.|3057000|419620001|3057000|399069006|3057000|419099009

Eventually
their hind legs|30021000
become
useless.

They often also|70232002
exhibit
faecal|39477002
and
urinary incontinence.|165232002

As the disease progresses,|64572001|385651009
the paresis
and
paralysis gradually|44695005
move|302000008|384598002|370125004
forward.|255540008

This disease also|64572001
affects|4065008
other large breeds|74964007|255509001
of dogs.|448771007

It
is
suspected to|415684004
be
an autoimmune problem.|263680009|55607006

Cats|448169003|388618001
with a heart murmur|421493004
may
develop
blood clots|75753009
that travel|420008001
through arteries.|51114001|11527006

If
a clot|387325003|75753009
is
large enough to|255509001
block|26036001|112232007
one|421379005
or
both femoral arteries,|7657000
there
may
be
hind leg paralysis|60389000
because
the major source|255603008|260753009
of blood flow|58190003
to the hind leg|61685007|30021000|182281004|362793004
is
blocked.|26036001|112232007

Many snakes|260396001|107280007
exhibit
powerful neurotoxins|33300005|363642007
that
can
cause|23981006|134198009
non-permanent paralysis|6934004|44695005
or
death.|419620001|268923008
