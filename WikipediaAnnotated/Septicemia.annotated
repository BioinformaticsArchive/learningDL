(/?s?ps?s/|288495006
;
from the Greek ?????|1451003
:
the state|398070004
of putrefaction|51743001
and
decay|125366008
)
is
a potentially deadly medical condition|74188005|260905004
characterized
by a whole-body inflammatory state|261188006|398070004
(
called
a systemic inflammatory response syndrome|238150007
or
SIRS
)
that
is
triggered|410658008
by an infection.

The body|279495008|123037004
may
develop
this inflammatory response
by the immune system|116003000
to microbes|264395009
in the blood,|87612001|119273009
urine,|78014005
lungs,|39607008

A popular term
for sepsis|105592009|91302008
is
*
*blood poisoning|5758002|105592009

Severe sepsis|24484000|105592009|24484000|91302008
is
the systemic inflammatory response,|31099001

*septic?mia** [?s?p.t?.?si.mi?])[3]|105592009|91302008
is
a related medical term referring|272151006|74188005|439980006|262094002|74188005|439980006
to the presence|386397008
of pathogenic organisms|264418008
in the bloodstream,
leading|236874000
to sepsis.|105592009|91302008

The term
has
not
been
sharply
defined.

It
has
been
inconsistently
used|394850002
in the past|410513005
by medical professionals,|74188005
for example
as a synonym
of bacteremia,|5758002
causing|23981006
some confusion.[2]|286933003

Sepsis|105592009|91302008
is
usually
treated|28995006
with intravenous fluids|118431008
and
antibiotics.|255631004

If fluid replacement|78534001
isn't
sufficient to|51117008
maintain|385630006
blood pressure,|75367002|392570002|386536003
vasopressors|372881000
can
be
used.|394850002

Mechanical ventilation
and
dialysis|108241001|265764009
may
be
needed|410525008|103325001
to
support|9096001|243114000
the function|246464006
of the lungs|39607008
and
kidneys,|64033007|17373004
respectively.

To
guide|106384005|303479009
therapy,|276239002
a central venous catheter|52124006
and
an arterial catheter|303727009
may
be
placed|257557008|421066005
;
measurement|272391002
of other hemodynamic variables|74964007|255372005
(
such as cardiac output,|82799009
mixed venous oxygen saturation|250552004|442734002
or
stroke volume variation|90096001|40885006
)
may
also
be
used.|394850002

Sepsis patients|105592009|116154003|91302008|116154003
require
preventive measures|262073000|246445000|262073000|367346004|129428001|246445000|129428001|367346004
for deep vein thrombosis,|128053003|404223003
stress ulcers|415624002|415623008
and
pressure ulcers,|420226006
unless
other conditions|74964007|260905004
prevent
this.

Some
might
benefit
from tight control|255365009|31509003|228187009|31509003
of blood sugar levels|33747003|365812005
with insulin|412222002
(targeting stress hyperglycemia.|262188008|80394007

The use|277889008|419385000
of corticosteroids|79440004
is
controversial.

Activated drotrecogin alfa|416468004
(recombinant activated protein C,|130626008
originally
marketed|284440009
for severe sepsis,|24484000|105592009|24484000|91302008
has
not
been
found|404684003
to
be
helpful,
and
has
recently|6493001
been
withdrawn|247755007
from sale.[7]

In addition|260364009
to symptoms
related|272151006|262094002
to the provoking infection,
sepsis|105592009|91302008
is
frequently|70232002
associated|47429007
with
either
fever|386661006
or
hypothermia,|386689009|241970005
rapid breathing,|271823003
and
a rapid heart rate.|3424008

Sepsis|105592009|91302008
may
also
lead|88488004
to a drop|404218003
in blood pressure,|75367002|392570002|386536003
resulting|42752001
in shock.|27942005

This
may
result|394617004
in light-headedness.|386705008

Bruising|125667009
or
intense bleeding|103370009|131148009
may
also
occur.|272120004

The most common primary sources|4757001|72906007|63161005|260753009|4757001|72906007|261424001|260753009
of infection
resulting|42752001
in sepsis|105592009|91302008
are
the lungs,|39607008
the abdomen|277112006|52731004|302553009
and
the urinary tract.|122489005

In a third|70905002
of cases|398241000|413769002
no source|260753009
is
found.|404684003

The infectious agents|36272005
are
usually bacteria|409822003
but
can
also
be
fungi|414561005
and
viruses.[8]|49872002

In those with sepsis|20401003|105592009|20401003|91302008|421463005|105592009|421463005|91302008
it
is
recommended
that blood cultures|30088009
be
drawn
before antibiotics|255631004
are
given.[5]|419582001

According to the American College of Chest Physicians|224864007|309345004
and
the Society
of Critical Care Medicine,|408478003
there
are
different levels|263735002|258395000
of sepsis|105592009|91302008
:
[2]|260306008

Infection
can
be
suspected|415684004
or
proven|277025001
(
by culture,|252398009|61594008

More specific definitions|242762006|69658003
of end-organ dysfunction|261782000|410653004|386585008|422117008|410653004|386585008
exist
for SIRS
in pediatrics.[12]|394537008

Consensus definitions,
however,
continue|255238004
to
evolve|59381007
,
with the latest|260383002
expanding|70955005
the list
of signs|72670004
and
symptoms
of sepsis to|105592009|91302008

clinical bedside experience.[1]|58147004

In common clinical usage,|72906007|58147004|277889008
neonatal sepsis specifically|41229001
refers|439980006
to the presence|386397008
of a bacterial blood stream infection (BSI),|409822003|431193003
such as meningitis,|7180009
pneumonia,|205237003
pyelonephritis,|45816000
or
gastroenteritis,|25374005
in the setting
of fever.|386661006

Criteria
with
regards
to hemodynamic compromise
or
respiratory failure|409622000
are
not useful clinically
because
these symptoms often|70232002
do
not
arise|68727004
in neonates|133933007
until death|419620001|268923008
is
imminent
and
unpreventable.

Systemic inflammatory response syndrome|238150007
is
evidence|18669006
of the body's|279495008|123037004
ongoing|255238004
inflammatory response.

When
SIRS
is
suspected|415684004
or
known to|36692007
be
caused|23981006|134198009
by an infection,
this
is
sepsis.|105592009|91302008

Severe sepsis|24484000|105592009|24484000|91302008
occurs|272120004
when
sepsis|105592009|91302008
leads|88488004|236874000
to organ dysfunction,|410653004|386585008
such as pulmonary dysfunction,|39607008|386585008|264164005|386585008
coagulation|129390001
or
other blood abnormalities,|74964007|87612001|276654001|74964007|119273009|276654001
decreased urine production,|1250004|78014005|260400001|78014005|260371004|78014005
or
altered mental status.|419284004

If
the organ dysfunction|410653004|386585008
of severe sepsis|24484000|105592009|24484000|91302008
is
associated|47429007
with low blood pressure|45007003
(hypotension,|45007003
or
insufficient blood flow|71978007|58190003|423437008|58190003

or
more organs|242762006|410653004
(causing,|23981006
for example,
lactic acidosis,|91273001
this
is
septic shock.|76571007

Sepsis|105592009|91302008
can
lead|88488004
to multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS)|57653000
(formerly
known|36692007
as multiple organ failure|57653000
)
,
and
death.|419620001|268923008

Organ dysfunction|410653004|386585008
results|394617004
from local changes|255470001|243326001|255470001|263703002
in blood flow,|58190003
from sepsis-induced hypotension|105592009|241727003|91302008|241727003
(
< 90 mmHg|264705001|304621005|264703008|304621005
or
a reduction|58294000|260400001|289928003
of ? 40 mmHg|259031006|304621005
from baseline
)
and
from diffuse intravascular coagulation,|19648000|261101003|19648000|261101003|129390001
among other things.|74964007

Sepsis|105592009|91302008
can
be
defined
as the body's response|279495008|123037004
to an infection.

An infection
is
caused|23981006|134198009
by microorganisms|264395009
or
bacteria|409822003
invading
the body|279495008|123037004
and
can
be
limited|255469002
to a particular body region|52530000|38866009|243928005
or
can
be
widespread|85333001
in the bloodstream.

Bacteremia|5758002
is
the presence|386397008
of viable bacteria|263927007|409822003
in the bloodstream.

Likewise,
the terms viremia|2528003
and
fungemia simply|434532004
refer|439980006
to viruses|49872002
and
fungi|414561005
in the bloodstream.

These terms
say|66049007
nothing about
the consequences|103332005
this
has
on the body.|279495008|123037004

For example,
bacteria|409822003
can
be
introduced|127487003
into the bloodstream
during toothbrushing.

This form|246176004
of bacteremia almost never|5758002
causes|134198009
problems|55607006
in normal individuals.|17621005|125676002|17621005|385435006|258744000|125676002|258744000|385435006

However,
bacteremia|5758002
associated|47429007
with certain dental procedures|17162000|108306002
can
cause|23981006|134198009
bacterial infection|301811001
of the heart valves|17401000
(
known|36692007
as endocarditis|56819008
in high-risk patients.|15508007|116154003

Conversely,
a systemic inflammatory response syndrome|238150007
can
occur|272120004
in patients|116154003
without the presence|386397008
of infection,
for example
in those with burns,|20401003|125666000|421463005|125666000
polytrauma,
or
the initial state|884001|398070004|232714002|398070004
in pancreatitis|75694006
and
chemical pneumonitis.[2]|233733000

The therapy|276239002
of sepsis|105592009|91302008
rests|258157001
on intravenous fluids,|118431008
antibiotics,|255631004
surgical drainage|83578000|307488001|83578000|122462000
of infected fluid collections,|32457005|33463005|255765007
and
appropriate support|9096001|243114000
for organ dysfunction.|410653004|386585008

This
may
include|55919000
hemodialysis|302497006
in kidney failure,|42399005
mechanical ventilation
in pulmonary dysfunction,|39607008|386585008|264164005|386585008
transfusion|303955003|116859006|5447007
of blood products,|410652009
and
drug|410942007
and
fluid therapy|32457005|276239002|33463005|276239002|255765007|276239002|276239002
for circulatory failure.|27942005

Ensuring
adequate nutrition?preferably|51117008|87276001|51117008|384759009|88323005|87276001|88323005|384759009
by enteral feeding,|229912004
but
if necessary
by parenteral nutrition?
is
important
during prolonged illness.|255224006|39104002

In those with high blood sugar levels,|20401003|80394007|421463005|80394007
insulin to|412222002
bring|68369002
it
down
to 7.8-10 mmol/L (140-180 mg/dL|414744005|427264006|258718000|258797006
)
is
recommended
with lower levels potentially worsening outcomes.|261122009|258395000|230993007|394617004|261122009|258395000|231877006|394617004

Medication to|410942007
prevent
deep vein thrombosis|128053003|404223003
and
gastric ulcers|397825006
may
also
be
used.[5]|394850002

In severe sepsis,|24484000|105592009|24484000|91302008
broad spectrum antibiotics|90522003|255631004
are
recommended
within 1 hour|260305007|258702006|260305007|286551008
of making
the diagnosis.|439401001

For every hour delay|258702006|286551008
in the administration there|413454004|416118004
is
an associated 6% rise|47429007
in mortality.|409651001

Duration|103335007
of treatment|276239002|416118004
is
typically 7-10 days|258703001
with the type|261664005
of antibiotic|255631004
used|394850002
directed|255589003
by the results|394617004
of cultures.[5]|252398009|61594008

Early goal directed therapy (EGDT)|264499004|391892008
is
an approach
to the management|413454004|119270007
of severe sepsis|24484000|105592009|24484000|91302008
during the initial 6 hours|884001|258702006|232714002|258702006
after diagnosis.|439401001

A step-wise approach|398298007
should
be
used|394850002
,
with the physiologic goal|1360005|410518001
of optimizing cardiac preload,|80891009

Urine output|130953005|365678000
is
also
monitored|302805002|13288007
,
with a minimum goal|255605001|410518001|255604002|410518001
of 0.5 ml/kg/h.|260316000|258989006|223574006|260316000|258989006|258683005|260316000|396180007|89177007|260316000|396180007|258322007|260316000|396180007|286551008

In the original trial,|19535007|110465008
mortality|409651001
was
cut|283396008
from 46.5%
to 30.5%.

An appropriate decrease|260400001|260370003
in serum lactate however|270982000
may
be
equivalent|9726003|258726008
to SvO2
and
easier to|36203004
obtain.[18]|398092000

In EGDT,
fluids|32457005|33463005
are
administered|418283001
until the central venous pressure (CVP),|71420008|366162006
as
measured|258104002
by a central venous catheter,|52124006
reaches|282679008
8?12 cm
of water|11713004|119318008
(
or
10?15 cm
of water|11713004|119318008
in mechanically ventilated patients|371820004
).

Rapid administration|255358001|413454004|255358001|416118004
of several liters|261028005|258770004
of isotonic crystalloid solution|8537005|77899000
is
usually
required
to
achieve
this.

Once these goals|410518001
are
met|229057006
,
the mixed venous oxygen saturation|250552004|442734002
(SvO2

i.e.,|42146005|22971001
the oxygen saturation|24099007|103401005
of venous blood|53130003
as
it returns|7528007
to the heart|80891009|302509004
as
measured|258104002
at the vena cava,|35532006|244405007
is
optimized.

If
the SvO2
is
less
than 70%,
blood|87612001|119273009
is
given to|419582001
reach|282679008
a hemoglobin|38082009
of 10 g/dl|258795003
and
then inotropes
are
added
until the SvO2
is
optimized.

Once the person|125676002
has
been
sufficiently fluid|32457005|33463005|255765007
resuscitated|304252001
if
the mean arterial pressure|6797001
is
not greater|263768009
than 65 mmHg vasopressors|264695004|304621005|372881000
are
recommended.

While
current recommendations|15240007
suggest
either
norepinephrine|45555007
(noradrenaline|45555007|35214005

or
dopamine,|412383006|32779004
[5]|264706000|264605009
the former|9130008
appears
safer.

If
a single pressor|125681006|50607009
is
not sufficient|51117008
in improving|385633008
the blood pressure,|75367002|392570002|386536003
epinephrine|387362001
(adrenaline|387362001|64722001
)
may
be
added
in.[5]|264706000|264605009

Elective tracheal intubation|103390000|112798008
and
mechanical ventilation
may
be
performed|398166005
to
reduce|260400001
oxygen|24099007
demand
if
the SvO2
remains
low|62482003|371880002
despite optimization
of hemodynamics._[citation

is
not
recommended
as a medication to|410942007
help
with intubation|52765003

due to concerns
of adrenal insufficiency|237785004|386584007

increased mortality.[21][22]|35105006|409651001|260366006|409651001

The use|277889008|419385000
of steroids|116566001
in sepsis|105592009|91302008
is
controversial.

During critical illness,|39104002
a state|398070004
of adrenal insufficiency|237785004|386584007
and
tissue resistance|85756007|30714006
to corticosteroids|79440004
may
occur.|272120004

This
has
been
termed critical illness?related corticosteroid insufficiency.|39104002|272151006|79440004|87828008|39104002|262094002|79440004|87828008

Treatment|276239002|416118004
with corticosteroids|79440004
might
be
most beneficial|4757001
in those with septic shock|20401003|76571007|421463005|76571007

its role
in others|74964007

or
severe pneumonia|24484000|205237003
is
unclear.

However,
the exact way
of determining corticosteroid insufficiency|79440004|87828008
remains
problematic.

It
should
be
suspected|415684004
in those poorly|556001
responding
to resuscitation|439569004

ACTH stimulation testing|49466006|122545008
is
not

The method|260686004|272394005
of cessation
of glucocorticoid drugs|419933005|410942007

Recombinant activated protein C|130626008
(drotrecogin alpha|416468004

originally
introduced|127487003
for severe sepsis|24484000|105592009|24484000|91302008
(
as
identified|7882003

)
,
where
it
was
thought|88952004
to
confer
a survival benefit.

However,
subsequent studies|255260001|110465008|255260001|224699009
showed
that
it
increased adverse events|35105006|272379006|260366006|272379006
and
did
not
decrease|260400001|260370003

Sepsis|105592009|91302008
causes|134198009
millions

Sepsis|105592009|91302008
is
common|72906007
and
serious|42745003
in the elderly,|105436006
the immunocompromised,|370391006
and
the critically ill.|367391008

It
occurs|272120004
in 1?2%|303183002
of all hospitalizations|394656005

accounts

as
much
as 25%

Severe systemic toxicity|24484000|105891008
has
been
recognised
since
before
the dawn
of history|392521001
but
it
was
only
in the 19th century
that
a specific term - sepsis -|69658003|105592009|69658003|91302008
was
coined
for this condition.|260905004

By the end|261782000|422117008
of the 19th century,
it
was
widely
believed
that microbes|264395009
produced
substances|105590001
that
could
injure
the mammalian host|387976007
and
that soluble toxins|80917008
released|68776005|129299003
during infection
caused|23981006|134198009
the fever|386661006
and
shock|27942005
that
were
commonplace
during severe infections.|24484000

Pfeiffer
coined
the term endotoxin|18127008
at the beginning|255395001
of the 20th century to
denote
the pyrogenic principle
associated|47429007
with _Vibrio cholerae_.|75953000

It
was
soon
realised
that endotoxins|18127008
were
expressed
by most
and
perhaps
all Gram negative organisms.|258682000|260385009|410653004

The lipopolysaccharide character|3325005
of enteric endotoxins|225770002|18127008
was
elucidated
in the 1944
by Shear.|64973003|8061008

The molecular character|290005005
of this material|260769002
was
determined
by Luderitz _
et
al_
in 1973.[30]

It
was
discovered
in 1965
that a strain|48532005|276768000
of C3H/HeJ mice|447612001|447482001
were
immune|255386009
to the endotoxin|18127008
induced|16404004
shock.|27942005

The genetic locus|3950001|255395001
for this effect|253861007
was
dubbed
_Lps_.|3325005|79261008

These mice|447612001|447482001
were
also
found|404684003
to
be
hypersusceptible
to infection
by Gram negative bacteria.|81325006

These observations|103705002
were
finally
linked
in 1998
by the discovery
of the Toll-like receptor gene 4 (TLR 4).|116647005|67271001

Genetic mapping work,|3950001|360220002|261041009|255395001|360220002|261041009
performed|398166005
over a period|259037005
of 5 years,|264706000|258707000|264605009|258707000
showed
that TLR4
was
the sole candidate locus|57999000
within the Lps critical region strongly|3325005|410673009|79261008|410673009
implying
that
a mutation|55446002
within TLR4
must
account
for the lipopolysaccharide resistance phenotype.|3325005|30714006|8116006|3325005|30714006|363778006

The defect|6920004
in the TLR4 gene|67271001
that
led|88488004|236874000
to the endotoxin resistant phenotype|18127008|30714006|8116006|18127008|30714006|363778006
was
discovered
to
be
due to a mutation|55446002
in the cytoplasmic domain.[33]|264667004

A large international collaboration|255509001
was
established|263748003|385645004
to
educate|409073007
people|125676002

entitled
the "Surviving Sepsis Campaign".|105592009|91302008

The Campaign

with the aim to
publish
a complete set|255594003
of guidelines
in subsequent years.[5]|255260001|258707000

In 2012
a paper|50833004
