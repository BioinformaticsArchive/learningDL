*Sporotrichosis|42094007
*
*
(also
known|36692007
as "Rose gardener's disease"[1]|34024003|64572001
)
is
a disease|64572001
caused|23981006|134198009
by the infection
of the fungus _Sporothrix schenckii_.|414561005|32662000

This fungal disease usually|3218000
affects|4065008
the skin,|119325001|39937001|181469002
although
other rare forms|74964007|84638005|246176004|74964007|103356009|246176004
can
affect|4065008
the lungs,|39607008
joints,|39352004|81087007
bones,|272673000|128530007
and
even
the brain.|12738006|258335003

Because
roses
can
spread|410677005
the disease,|64572001
it
is
one|421379005
of a few diseases|57176003|64572001
referred|439980006
to
as
_rose-thorn_|264233002
or
_rose-
gardeners|34024003
' disease_.[3]|64572001

Because _S.

schencki_
is
naturally
found|404684003
in soil,|415555003
hay,
sphagnum moss,|421648004
and
plants,|31006001
it usually
affects|4065008
farmers,|106388008
gardeners,|34024003
and
agricultural workers.|106541005

It
enters|417985001
through small cuts|255507004|283396008
and
abrasions|262536007|8420001|399963005
in the skin to|119325001|39937001|181469002
cause|23981006|134198009
the infection.

In case|398241000
of sporotrichosis|42094007
affecting|247591002|248448006
the lungs,|39607008
the fungal spores|46901008
enter|417985001
through the respiratory pathways.|258162000|449071006

Sporotrichosis|42094007
can
also
be
acquired|255396000
from handling cats|448169003|388618001
with the disease|64572001
;
it
is
an occupational hazard|17458004
for veterinarians.|106290006

Sporotrichosis|42094007
progresses|385651009
slowly -|419443000
the first symptoms|255216001|232714002
may
appear
1
to 12 weeks|258705008
(average 3 weeks|258705008
)
after the initial exposure|884001|71677004|884001|24932003|232714002|71677004|232714002|24932003
to the fungus.|414561005

Serious complications|42745003|116223007
can
also
develop
in patients|116154003
who
have
a compromised immune system.|116003000

Sporotrichosis|42094007
can
be
diagnosed|439401001
in domestic|261770009
and
wild mammals.|262290003|387976007

In veterinary medicine|53216000|410942007
it
is
most frequently|4757001|70232002
seen
in cats|448169003|388618001
and
horses.|35354009

Cats|448169003|388618001
have
a particularly severe form|24484000|246176004
of cutaneous sporotrichosis|80890005
and
also
can
serve
as a source|260753009
of zoonotic infection
to persons|125676002
who
handle
them
and
are
exposed|24932003
to exudate|247450001
from skin lesions.|95324001

Sporotrichosis|42094007
is
a chronic disease|27624003
with slow progression|419443000|246453008|419443000|246450006
and
often subtle symptoms.|70232002

It
is
difficult to|52925006
diagnose|439401001
,
as
many other diseases|74964007|64572001
share
similar symptoms
and
therefore
must
be
ruled|10828004
out.|255529000

Patients|116154003
with sporotrichosis|42094007
will
have
antibody|68498002|112133008
against the fungus S.|414561005

schenckii,
however,
due to variability|255372005
in sensitivity and specificity,|35209006|69658003|365705006|69658003
it
may
not
be
a reliable diagnosis|439401001
for this disease.|64572001

The confirming diagnosis remains|59156000|439401001|59156000
culturing|252398009|61594008
the fungus|414561005
from the skin,|119325001|39937001|181469002
sputum,|45710003
synovial fluid,|431898009
and
cerebrospinal fluid.|65216001

Cats|448169003|388618001
with sporotrichosis|42094007
are
unique
in
that
the exudate|247450001
from their lesions
may
contain|42504009
numerous organisms.|260396001|410653004

This
makes
cytological evaluation|40413002|40413002|386053000
of exudate|247450001
a valuable diagnostic tool|439401001|86967005|261004008|86967005
in this species.|69658003

Exudate|247450001
is
pyogranulomatous
and
phagocytic cells|73568005
may
be
packed|53999001
with yeast forms.|412534006

These
are
variable|255372005
in size,|277049003
but
many
are
cigar-shaped.|107644003|300842002

The majority
of sporotrichosis cases|42094007|398241000|42094007|413769002
occur|272120004
when
the fungus|414561005
is
introduced|127487003
through a cut|283396008
or
puncture|11639007|85921004
in the skin|119325001|39937001|181469002
while
handling vegetation|264340003
containing|42504009
the fungal spores.|46901008

Prevention|169443000
of this disease|64572001
includes|55919000
wearing long sleeves|255511005
and
gloves|52291003
while
working|261041009
with soil,|415555003
hay bales,
rose bushes,|112591004
pine seedlings,|45793000|228658007
and
sphagnum moss.|421648004

Treatment|276239002|416118004
of sporotrichosis|42094007
depends
on the severity|272141005
and
location|246267002
of the disease.|64572001

The following|255260001
are
treatment options|276239002|416118004
for this condition|260905004
:
[4]|260308009

Lipid formulations|70106000
of amphotericin B|77703004
are
usually
recommended
instead of amphotericin B deoxycholate|77703004|434444004
because of a better adverse-effect profile.|3442003|281647001|3442003

Amphotericin B|77703004
can
be
used|394850002
for severe infection|24484000
during pregnancy.|289908002

For children|410601007|160499008
with disseminated|65709003
or
severe disease,|24484000|64572001
amphotericin B deoxycholate|77703004|434444004
can
be
used|394850002
initially,|884001
followed|367409002
by itraconazole.[5]|387532006

Several studies|261028005|110465008|261028005|224699009
have
shown
that posaconazole|421747003
has
in vitro activity|48761009|55561003|258745004|257733005
similar
to that
of amphotericin B|77703004
and
itraconazole|387532006
;
therefore,
it
shows
promise
as an alternative therapy.|276239002

However,
voriconazole susceptibility|385469007|76522002|385469007|118588007
varies.

Because
the correlation
between
in vitro data
and
clinical response|58147004
has
not
been
demonstrated
,
there
is
insufficient evidence to|71978007|18669006|423437008|18669006
recommend
either
posaconazole|421747003
or
voriconazole|385469007
for treatment|276239002|416118004
of sporotrichosis|42094007
at this time.[5]|410669006

Sporotrichosis|42094007
can
develop
into other diseases,|74964007|64572001
including|55919000
cellulitis,|128045006
sarcoidosis,|31541009
and
