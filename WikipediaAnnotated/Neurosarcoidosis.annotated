*Neurosarcoidosis|230193008
*
*
(sometimes
shortened|359530003
to
*
*neurosarcoid
*

)
refers|439980006
to sarcoidosis,|31541009
a condition|260905004
of unknown cause featuring granulomas|261665006|134198009|45647009
in various tissues,|256220008|85756007
involving|248448006
the central nervous system|21483005|278199004
(brain|12738006|258335003
and
spinal cord|2748008|180959008
).

It
can
have
many manifestations,|260396001|250255003|260396001|251190009
but
abnormalities|276654001
of the cranial nerves|25238003
(
a group|261586004|160481000|389109008
of twelve nerves|82809009|3057000
supplying|425398004
the head|69536005|302548004
and
neck area|45048000|42798000|302550007|42798000
)
are
the most common.|4757001|72906007

It
may
develop
acutely,
subacutely,
and
chronically.

Approximately 5-10%|26175008
of people|125676002
with sarcoidosis|31541009
of other organs|74964007|410653004
(e.g.|258795003

lung|39607008|181216001
develop
central nervous system involvement.|21483005|248448006|278199004|248448006

Only 1%|50607009|420295001
of people|125676002
with sarcoidosis|31541009
will
have
neurosarcoidosis|230193008
alone|105529008
without involvement|248448006
of any other organs.|74964007|410653004

Diagnosis|439401001
can
be
difficult,|52925006
with no test|269814003|272393004
apart from biopsy|86273004
being
completely reliable.

Treatment|276239002|416118004
is
with immunosuppression.|86553008|38013005

The first case|255216001|398241000|232714002|398241000
of sarcoidosis|31541009
involving|248448006
the nervous system|25087005|278196006
was
reported|229059009|223458004
in 1948.[2][3]

Abnormalities|276654001
of the cranial nerves|25238003
are
present 50-70%|52101004|246105001
of cases.|398241000|413769002

The most common abnormality|4757001|72906007|276654001
is
involvement|248448006
of the facial nerve,|56052001
which
may
lead|88488004
to reduced power|260400001|33300005
on one|421379005
or
both sides|182353008
of the face|89545001|302549007
(65% resp 35%|264695004|86290005
of all cranial nerve cases|25238003|398241000|25238003|413769002|244447006|398241000|244447006|413769002
)
,
followed|367409002
by reduction|58294000|260400001|289928003
in visual perception|281004000|311886005
due to optic nerve involvement.|18234004|248448006|180938001|248448006

Rarer symptoms|84638005|103356009
are
double vision|24982008
(oculomotor nerve,|56193007
trochlear nerve|39322007|180939009
or
abducens nerve,|80622005
decreased sensation|398026008
of the face|89545001|302549007
(trigeminal nerve,|27612005
hearing loss|343087000|15188001
or
vertigo|399153001
(vestibulocochlear nerve,|8598002|180945001

problems|55607006
(glossopharyngeal nerve|21161002|106159002
and
weakness|13791008|260407003
of the shoulder muscles|102288007
(accessory nerve|15119000
or
the tongue|21974007|181226008
(hypoglossal nerve.|37899009

Visual problems|255374006|55607006
may
also
be
the result|394617004
of papilledema|423341008
(swelling|423666004|442672001
of the optic disc|81016008
due to obstruction|26036001
by granulomas|45647009
of the normal cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) circulation.[1]|17621005|29059006|258744000|29059006

Seizures|91175000
(mostly
of the tonic-clonic/"grand mal" type|47308002|352818000|261664005|47308002|65155005|261664005
)
are
present|52101004|246105001
in about 15%,
and
may
be
the presenting phenomenon|246105001
in 10%.[1]

Meningitis|7180009
(inflammation|257552002
of the lining|50009006
of the brain|12738006|258335003
)
occurs|272120004
in 3-26%|260313008
of cases.|398241000|413769002

Symptoms
may
include|55919000
headache|25064002
and
nuchal rigidity|405947006
(
being
unable to|371151008
bend|89684003|282977007
the head|69536005|302548004
forward|255540008
).

It
may
be
acute|272118002
or
chronic.[1]|90734009

Accumulation
of granulomas|45647009
in particular areas|42798000
of the brain|12738006|258335003
can
lead|88488004
to abnormalities|276654001
in the function|246464006
of
that area.|42798000

For instance,
involvement|248448006
of the internal capsule|85637007|279217003
would
lead|88488004
to weakness|13791008|260407003
in one|421379005
or
two limbs|420797005|66019005
on one side|66459002
of the body.|279495008|123037004

If
the granulomas|45647009
are
large,|255509001
they
can
exert|19487008
a mass effect|300848003|253861007|118538004|253861007
and
cause headache|134198009|25064002
and
increase|260366006
the risk|30207005
of seizures.|91175000

Obstruction|26036001
of the flow
of cerebrospinal fluid,|65216001
too,
can
cause|23981006|134198009
headaches,|25064002
visual symptoms|162274004
(
as
mentioned
above
)
and
other features|74964007
of raised intracranial pressure|271719001
and
hydrocephalus[1]|230745008

Involvement|248448006
of the spinal cord|2748008|180959008
is
rare,|84638005|103356009
but
can
lead|88488004
to abnormal sensation|91019004|247322000
or
weakness|13791008|260407003
in one|421379005
or
more limbs,|242762006|66019005
or
cauda equina symptoms|7173007|263377004
(incontinence|48340000|165232002
to urine|78014005
or
stool,|39477002
decreased sensation|398026008
in the buttocks.[1]|46862004

Granulomas|45647009
in the pituitary gland,|56329008|181125003
which
produces
numerous hormones,|260396001|87568004
is
rare|84638005|103356009
but
leads|88488004|236874000
to any
of the symptoms
of hypopituitarism|74728003
:
amenorrhoea|14302001
(cessation
of the menstrual cycle,|78456001
diabetes insipidus|15771004|45369008
(dehydration|34095006
due to inability to
concentrate
the urine|78014005
)
,
hypothyroidism|40930008
(decreased activity|255385008
of the thyroid|69748006|61020000
or
hypocortisolism|373662000
(deficiency|260372006|248325000
of cortisol.[1]|396458002

Psychiatric problems|27296002|55607006
occur|272120004
in 20%
of cases|398241000|413769002
;
many different disorders|263735002|64572001
have
been
reported|229059009|223458004
,
e.g.|258795003

depression|35489007|366979004|255339005
and
psychosis.|69322001|191525009

Peripheral neuropathy|42658009
has
been
reported|229059009|223458004
in
up to 15%
of cases|398241000|413769002
of neurosarcoidosis.[1]|230193008

Other symptoms|74964007
due to sarcoidosis|31541009
of other organs|74964007|410653004
may
be
uveitis|128473001
(inflammation|257552002
of the uveal layer|74862005
in the eye|81745001|244486005
)
,
dyspnoea|267036007
(shortness|359530003|367450005
of breath|11891009
)
,
arthralgia|57676002
(joint pains|57676002
)
,
lupus pernio|72470008
(
a red skin rash,|444827008|271807003|386713009|271807003|371240000|271807003
usually
of the face|89545001|302549007
)
,
erythema nodosum|32861005
(red skin lumps,|444827008|300848003
usually
on the shins|78234002
)
,
and
symptoms
of liver involvement|258322007
(jaundice|18165001
or
heart involvement|80891009|248448006|302509004|248448006
(heart failure.[1]|84114007|42343007

The diagnosis|439401001
of neurosarcoidosis often|230193008|70232002
is
difficult.|52925006

Definitive diagnosis|261002007|439401001|261002007
can
only
be
made
by biopsy|86273004
(surgically|83578000
removing|127485006
a tissue sample|119376003
).

Because of the risks|30207005
associated|47429007
with brain biopsies,|12738006|86273004|258335003|86273004
they
are
avoided
as much|242762006|4757001
as possible.|371930009|60022001

Other investigations|74964007|386053000
that
may
be
performed|398166005
in any
of the symptoms
mentioned
above|261183002
are
computed tomography (CT)|77477000
or
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)|113091000
of the brain,|12738006|258335003
lumbar puncture,|277762005|265232001
electroencephalography (EEG)|54550000
and
evoked potential (EP) studies.|446229003

If
the diagnosis|439401001
of sarcoidosis|31541009
is
suspected,|415684004
typical X-ray|52250000|168537006|363680008
or
CT appearances|255412001
of the chest|261179002
may
make
the diagnosis more likely|439401001|2931005|2931005
;
elevations|255456001
in angiotensin-converting enzyme|112049007
and
calcium|5540006
in the blood,|87612001|119273009
too,
make
sarcoidosis more likely.|31541009|2931005

In the past,|410513005
the Kveim test|164983003
was
used|394850002
to
diagnose|439401001
sarcoidosis.|31541009

This now obsolete test|41228009|269814003|41228009|41228009|272393004
had
a high|75540009|371879000
(85%
)
sensitivity,|35209006|365705006
but
required spleen tissue|78961009|85756007|181279003|85756007
of a known sarcoidosis patient,|36692007|31541009|116154003
an extract|62972009
of which
was
injected|422145002
into the skin|119325001|39937001|181469002
of a suspected case.[1]|398241000|415684004|398241000

Only biopsy|50607009|86273004|420295001|86273004
of suspicious lesions|22927000
in the brain|12738006|258335003
or
elsewhere
is
considered useful
for a definitive diagnosis|261002007|439401001|261002007
of neurosarcoid.

This
would
demonstrate
granulomas|45647009
(collections
of inflammatory cells|256923004
)
rich|224166006
in epithelioid cells|4421005
and
surrounded|355648006
by other immune system cells|74964007|116003000|4421005
(e.g.|258795003

plasma cells,|113335003
mast cells.|6445007

Biopsy|86273004
may
be
performed|398166005
to
distinguish
mass|300848003|118538004
lesions
from tumours|108369006
(e.g.|258795003

gliomas.[1]|393564001

MRI|113091000
with gadolinium enhancement|58281002|418393006
is
the most useful neuroimaging test.|4757001|269814003|4757001|4757001|272393004

This
may
show
enhancement|418393006
of the pia mater|23180006
or
white matter lesions|413773004|185984009|371251000
that
may
resemble
the lesions
seen
in multiple sclerosis.[1]|24700007

Lumbar puncture|277762005|265232001
may
demonstrate
raised protein level,|260399008|365799007
pleiocytosis
(i.e.|42146005|22971001

increased presence|35105006|386397008|260366006|386397008
of
both
lymphocytes|56972008|446325007
and
neutrophil granulocytes|116712007
and
oligoclonal bands.|259810009

Various other tests|256220008|269814003|256220008|272393004
(e.g.|258795003

ACE level|258395000|276625007
in CSF
)
have
little added value.[1]

Some recent papers|6493001|50833004
propose
to
classify|73504009
neurosarcoidosis|230193008
by likelihood|2931005
:
[1]|260305007

Sarcoidosis|31541009
is
a disease|64572001
of unknown cause|261665006|134198009
that
leads|88488004|236874000
to the development|278923009
of granulomas|45647009
in various organs.|256220008|410653004

While
the lungs|39607008
are
typically
involved|248448006
,
other organs|74964007|410653004
may
equally
be
affected.|247591002|248448006

Some subforms
of sarcoidosis,|31541009
such as L?fgren syndrome,|258995007|420559008
may
have
a particular precipitant
and
have
a specific course.|69658003|288524001

It
is
unknown|261665006
which characteristics
predispose
sarcoidosis patients|31541009|116154003
to brain|12738006|258335003
or
spinal cord involvement.[1]|264197006

Neurosarcoidosis,|230193008
once
confirmed|59156000
,
is
generally
treated|28995006
with glucocorticoids|419933005
such as prednisolone.|116601002

If
this
is
effective,|255403003|254648000
the dose|277406006|408102007
may
gradually
be
reduced|260400001
(
although
many patients|116154003
need|410525008|103325001
to
remain
on steroids long-term, frequently|116566001|70232002
leading|236874000
to side-effects
such as diabetes|73211009
or
osteoporosis.|64859006

Methotrexate,|387381009
hydroxychloroquine,|373540008
cyclophosphamide,|387420009
pentoxifylline,|387522004
thalidomide|404878004
and
infliximab|386891004
have
been
reported|229059009|223458004
to
be
effective|255403003|254648000
in small studies.|255507004|110465008|255507004|224699009

In patients|116154003
unresponsive|20646008|422768004
to medical treatment,|74188005|276239002|74188005|416118004
radiotherapy|419815003|108290001
may
be
required.

If
the granulomatous tissue|255448004|85756007
causes|134198009
obstruction|26036001
or
mass effect,|300848003|253861007|118538004|253861007
neurosurgical intervention|225334002
is
sometimes
necessary.

Seizures|91175000
can
be
prevented|116699007
with anticonvulsants,|255632006
and
psychiatric phenomena|27296002
may
be
treated|28995006
with medication usually|410942007
employed|224363007
in these situations.[1]

Of the phenomena
occurring|272120004
in neurosarcoid,
only facial nerve involvement|50607009|56052001|248448006|420295001|56052001|248448006
is
known to|36692007
have
a good prognosis|170968001
and
good response|20572008
to treatment.|276239002|416118004

Long-term treatment|276239002|416118004

Sarcoidosis|31541009
has
a prevalence
of 40|259031006
per 100,000.

Given|419582001
that less|276139006|263796003

of these
will
have
neurological involvement,|1199008|248448006

in their disease course,|246453008
neurosarcoidosis|230193008
has
a prevalence
of less|276139006|263796003
than 4|260308009
per 100,000.[1]

Sarcoidosis most commonly|31541009
affects|4065008
young adults|84422007|133936004
of
both
sexes,|258139002|365952006|263495000|70256003|57312000
although
studies|110465008|224699009
have
reported|229059009|223458004
more cases|242762006|398241000|242762006|413769002
in females.|248152002

Incidence
is
highest|75540009|371879000
for individuals|125676002|385435006
younger|84422007

Sarcoidosis|31541009
occurs|272120004
throughout the world
in all races|415229000

The disease|64572001
is
most prevalent|4757001
in Northern European countries|223633000
and
the highest annual incidence|75540009|53281000|371879000|53281000
of 60/100,

In the United States sarcoidosis|223688001|31541009
is
more common|242762006|72906007
in people|125676002
of African descent|413464008
than Caucasians,|413773004|185984009
with annual incidence|53281000
reported|229059009|223458004
as 35.5
and
10.9/100,000,
respectively.

Sarcoidosis|31541009
is
less commonly|276139006|263796003
reported|229059009|223458004
in South America,|223504005

There
may
be
a higher susceptibility|75540009|76522002|75540009|118588007|371879000|76522002|371879000|118588007
to sarcoidosis|31541009
in those with coeliac disease.|20401003|396331005|421463005|396331005

An association|263534001|272151006
between the two disorders|420797005|64572001
has
been
suggested.[7]

The differing incidence
across the world
may
be
at least partially attributable|276139006|263796003
to the lack|41277001
of screening programs|20135006
in certain regions|17162000|410673009
of the world
and
the overshadowing presence|386397008
of other granulomatous diseases,|74964007|128561003
such as tuberculosis,|371569005
that
may
interfere|78235001
with the diagnosis|439401001
of sarcoidosis|31541009
where they
are
prevalent.

There
may
also
be
differences|263735002
in the severity|272141005
of the disease|64572001
between people|125676002
of different ethnicities.|263735002|397731000

Several studies|261028005|110465008|261028005|224699009
suggest
that
the presentation|246105001
in people|125676002
of African origin|160514004
may
be
more severe|242762006|24484000
and
disseminated|65709003
than
for Caucasians,|413773004|185984009
who
are
more likely to|242762006|2931005
have
asymptomatic disease.[8]|84387000|64572001

Manifestation|250255003|251190009
appears
to
be
slightly different|425404009|263735002
according to race|415229000
and
sex.|258139002|365952006|263495000|70256003|57312000

Erythema nodosum|32861005
is
far more common|46053002|72906007
in men|339947000
than
in women|224526002
and
in Caucasians|413773004|185984009
than
in other races.

In Japanese patients,|414551003|116154003
ophthalmologic|394594003|239005
and
cardiac involvement|80891009|248448006
are
more common|242762006|72906007
than
in other races.[4]

Sarcoidosis|31541009
is
one|421379005
of the few pulmonary diseases|57176003|19829001
