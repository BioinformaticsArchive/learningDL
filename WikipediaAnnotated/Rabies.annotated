(
pronounced
/?re?bi?z/.|228877007

From Latin
:
_rabies_,|14168008|396437008
"
madness
"
)
is
a viral disease|34014006
that
causes|134198009
acute encephalitis|272118002|45170000
in warm-blooded animals.

The disease|64572001
is
zoonotic,
meaning|255586005
it
can
be
transmitted|60117003|258150004
from one species|421379005|69658003
to another,
such as
from dogs|448771007
to humans,|278412004
commonly
by a bite|3404009|25272006
from an infected animal.|387961004

For a human,|278412004
rabies|14168008|396437008
is
almost invariably fatal|399166001
if postexposure prophylaxis|409516001
is
not
administered|418283001
prior to the onset|77374008
of severe symptoms.|162470006

The rabies virus|59881000
infects
the central nervous system,|21483005|278199004
ultimately
causing|23981006
disease|64572001
in the brain|12738006|258335003
and
death.|419620001|268923008

The rabies virus travels|59881000|420008001
to the brain|12738006|258335003
by
following|255260001
the peripheral nerves.|84782009

The incubation period|406646006
of the disease|64572001
is
usually
a few months|57176003|258706009
in humans,|278412004
depending
on the distance|246132006
the virus|49872002
must
travel|420008001
to
reach|282679008
the central nervous system.|21483005|278199004

Once the rabies virus|59881000
reaches|282679008
the central nervous system|21483005|278199004
and
symptoms
begin|255395001
to
show
,
the infection
is
virtually untreatable
and
usually fatal|399166001
within days.|258703001

Early-stage symptoms|264499004|21191007|264499004|371508000|264499004|261612004
of rabies|14168008|396437008
are
malaise,|367391008
headache|25064002
and
fever,|386661006
progressing|255314001
to acute pain,|274663001
violent movements,|255324009
uncontrolled excitement,|19032002|58901008
depression,|35489007|366979004|255339005
and
hydrophobia.|14168008

Finally,
the patient|116154003
may
experience
periods|259037005
of mania|231494001
and
lethargy,|214264003
eventually
leading|236874000
to coma.|371632003|405809000

The primary cause|63161005|23981006|63161005|134198009|261424001|23981006|261424001|134198009
of death|419620001|268923008
is
usually respiratory insufficiency.[2]|409623005|409622000

Rabies|14168008|396437008
causes|134198009
about 55,000 human deaths annually worldwide.|264691008|278412004|419620001|53281000|264691008|278412004|268923008|53281000

95%
of human deaths|278412004|419620001|278412004|268923008
due to rabies|14168008|396437008
occur|272120004
in Asia|223500001
and
Africa.|223498002

[4]Roughly 97%|260308009|260309001|260308009|264708004
of human rabies cases|398446008|398241000|398446008|413769002
result|394617004
from dog bites.|217697000

In the
US,
animal control|387961004|31509003
and
vaccination programs
have
effectively
eliminated
domestic dogs|448771007
as reservoirs|257687008
of rabies.|14168008|396437008

In several countries,|261028005|223369002
including|55919000
Australia|223621005
and
Japan,|223583001
rabies|14168008|396437008
carried|288345009
by terrestrial animals|387961004
has
been
eliminated
entirely.

While
rabies|14168008|396437008
had
once
been
eradicated
in the United Kingdom,|223860005
infected bats|388074005
have
recently|6493001
been
found|404684003
in Scotland.|223678002

[8]

The period|259037005
between infection
and
the first flu-like symptoms|255216001|315642008|232714002|315642008
is
typically 2
to 12 weeks,|258705008
but
incubation periods|406646006
as short|359530003|367450005
as four days|421534005|258703001
and
longer|255511005
than six years|422218008|258707000
have
been
documented|397934002
,
depending
on the location|246267002
and
severity|272141005
of the inoculating wound|13924000
and
the amount|107651007
of virus|49872002
introduced.|127487003

Soon
after
,
the symptoms
expand|70955005
to slight|255510006|255604002
or
partial paralysis,
anxiety,|48694002|197480006
insomnia,|193462001
confusion,|286933003
agitation,|162221009
abnormal behavior,|25786006
paranoia,|191667009
terror,
and
hallucinations,|7011001
progressing|255314001
to delirium.|419567006

Rabies|14168008|396437008
has
been
called hydrophobia|14168008
because
victims,
locally
paralyzed|44695005
and
unable to|371151008
swallow|107160003|421521009
,
have
been
known|36692007
to
become
agitated|162221009
at the sight|281004000
of water.[10]|11713004|119318008

Death almost invariably|419620001|268923008
results|394617004
2
to 10 days|258703001
after first symptoms.|255216001|232714002

Once symptoms
have
presented|246105001
,
survival
is
rare, even|84638005|103356009
with the administration|413454004|416118004
of proper
and
intensive care.

In 2005 Jeanna Giese,
the first patient|255216001|116154003|232714002|116154003
treated|28995006
with the Milwaukee protocol,|258049002
[12]
became
the first person ever|255216001|125676002|232714002|125676002
recorded
to
survive
rabies|14168008|396437008
without receiving successful postexposure prophylaxis.|385669000|409516001

An intention to|367565008|361269008
treat|395077000
analysis|272389005
has
since
found|404684003
this protocol|258049002
has
a survival rate
of about 8%.[13]

The reference method|260686004|272394005
for diagnosing rabies|439401001|14168008|439401001|396437008
is
by performing PCR|258066000|103338009
or
viral culture|12717000
on brain samples|12738006|123038009|258335003|123038009
taken|419652001
after death.|419620001|268923008

The diagnosis|439401001
can
also
be
reliably
made
from skin samples|119325001
taken|419652001
before death.|419620001|268923008

Diagnosis|439401001
can
be
made
from saliva,|256897009
urine,|78014005
and
cerebrospinal fluid samples,|258450006
but
this
is
not
as sensitive.|83185005

Cerebral inclusion bodies|279495008|123037004
called
Negri bodies|62956001
are
100% diagnostic|439401001|261004008
for rabies infection|14168008|396437008
but
are
found|404684003
in only about 80%|50607009|420295001
of cases.|398241000|413769002

If possible,|371930009|60022001
the animal|387961004
from which
the bite|3404009|25272006
was
received
should
also
be
examined|64049009
for rabies.[15]|14168008|396437008

The differential diagnosis|47965005
in a case|398241000
of suspected human rabies|398446008|415684004|398446008
may
initially|884001
include|55919000
any cause|134198009
of encephalitis,|45170000
in particular infection
with viruses|49872002
such as herpesviruses,|128377001
enteroviruses,|243633006
and
arboviruses|281165003
such as West Nile virus.|57311007

The most important viruses to|4757001|49872002
rule|10828004
out
are
herpes simplex virus type one,|314797000|261664005|421379005
varicella-zoster virus,|19551004
and
(less commonly|276139006|263796003
)
enteroviruses,|243633006
including|55919000
coxsackieviruses,
echoviruses,|39164004
polioviruses,|44172002
and
human enteroviruses 68|12997006
to 71.[16]|264699005

New causes|7147002|134198009
of viral encephalitis|34476008
are
also possible,|371930009|60022001
as
was
evidenced|18669006
by the 1999 outbreak|443684005
in Malaysia|223591005
of 300 cases|398241000|413769002
of encephalitis|45170000
with a mortality rate|409651001
of 40%|259031006
caused|23981006|134198009
by Nipah virus,|115511007
a newly recognized paramyxovirus.

Likewise,
well-known viruses|20572008|36692007|49872002
may
be
introduced|127487003
into new locales,|7147002
as is
illustrated
by the recent outbreak|6493001|443684005
of encephalitis|45170000
due to West Nile virus|57311007
in the eastern
US.

Epidemiologic factors,
such as season,|21864008
geographic location,|246267002
and
the patient's age,|116154003|424144002
travel history,|420008001|420008001|392521001
and
possible exposure|371930009|71677004|371930009|24932003|60022001|71677004|60022001|24932003
to bites,|3404009
rodents,|388077003
and
ticks,|106831000
may
help
direct|255589003
the diagnosis.|439401001

Cheaper rabies diagnosis|14168008|439401001|14168008|396437008|439401001|396437008
will
become
possible|371930009|60022001
for low-income settings|424860001
:
accurate rabies diagnosis|263656005|14168008|439401001|263656005|14168008|263656005|396437008|439401001|263656005|396437008
can
be
done
at a tenth|28226006
of the cost
of traditional testing|263901007|263901007|272393004
using|260676000
basic light microscopy techniques.[19]|104157003|272394005|56242006|278289002|371268001|278289002|418836005|104157003|272394005|418836005|56242006|278289002|418836005|371268001|278289002

All human cases|278412004|398241000|278412004|413769002
of rabies|14168008|396437008
were
fatal|399166001
until a vaccine|398827000
was
developed
in 1885
by Louis Pasteur
and ?mile Roux.|258678002

Their original vaccine|19535007|398827000
was
harvested
from infected rabbits,|88818001
from which
the virus|49872002
in the nerve tissue|91728009|110657001
was
weakened
by allowing
it to
dry|13880007
for five|421820001
to 10 days.|258703001

Similar nerve tissue-derived vaccines|91728009|398827000|110657001|398827000
are
still
used|394850002
in some countries,|223369002
as
they
are
much cheaper|242762006|4757001
than modern cell culture vaccines.[21]|4421005|252398009|398827000|4421005|61594008|398827000|362837007|252398009|398827000|362837007|61594008|398827000

The human diploid cell rabies vaccine|412288000|89304008|4421005|412288000|89304008|362837007
was
started|385652002
in 1967

or
mentally
disabled
or
intoxicated person,|125676002
is
regarded
as an indication|410666004
for postexposure prophylaxis (PEP).|409516001

The recommendation
for the precautionary use|277889008|419385000
of PEP
in occult bat encounters|81674002|388074005|6080000|388074005
where no contact|11723008|70862002
is
recognized
has
been
questioned
in the medical literature,|74188005
based|418836005
on a cost-benefit analysis.|272389005

However,
a 2002 study|110465008|224699009
has
supported|9096001|243114000
the protocol|258049002
of precautionary administering|418283001
of PEP
where a child|410601007|160499008
or
mentally compromised individual|125676002|385435006
has
been
alone|105529008
with a bat,|388074005
especially
in sleep areas,|258158006|42798000
where
a bite|3404009|25272006
or
exposure|71677004|24932003
may
occur|272120004
without the victim
being
aware.|312012004

Begun|255395001
with little|281411007|255507004
or
no delay,
PEP
is
100% effective|255403003|254648000
against rabies.|14168008|396437008

In the case|398241000
in which there
has
been
a significant delay|386134007
in administering PEP,|418283001
the treatment|276239002|416118004
should
be
administered|418283001
regardless,
as
it
may
still
be
effective.[28]|255403003|254648000

Recent evidence|6493001|18669006
indicates|410535002
artificially
increasing|260369004
the permeability|82540007
of the blood brain barrier,|20245001
which normally
does
not
allow
most immune cells|255386009|4421005

viral clearance.[31][32]|260695007|264664006

In 2004,
American teenager Jeanna Giese|133937008
survived
an infection
of rabies|14168008|396437008
unvaccinated.

She
was
placed|257557008|421066005
into an induced coma|16404004|371632003|16404004|405809000
upon onset|77374008

and
given ketamine,|373464007
midazolam,|373476007
ribavirin,|387188005
and
amantadine.|372763006

Her doctors|309343006
administered|418283001
treatment|276239002|416118004
based|418836005
on the hypothesis
that detrimental effects|253861007
of rabies|14168008|396437008
were
caused|23981006|134198009
by temporary dysfunctions|14803004|386585008
in the brain|12738006|258335003
and
could
be
avoided
by inducing|16404004
a temporary partial halt|14803004|255609007
in brain function|12738006|246464006|258335003|246464006
that
would
protect
the brain|12738006|258335003

while
giving|419582001
the immune system time to|116003000|410669006
defeat
the virus.|49872002

After 31 days|264664006|258703001
of isolation|40174006|46651001
and
76 days|258703001
of hospitalization,|394656005
Giese
was
released|68776005|129299003
from the hospital.|285201006

She
survived
with almost
no permanent after effects,|6934004|253861007
and
as of 2009,
was
starting|255395001|385652002

Giese's treatment regimen|276239002|416118004
became
known|36692007
as the "Milwaukee protocol",|258049002
which
has
since undergone revision|255231005|118635009|261560009
with the second version|81170007|22303008|257997001|22303008|288495006|22303008
omitting
the use|277889008|419385000
of ribavirin.|387188005

Two|420797005
of 25 patients|116154003
survived
when
treated|28995006
under the first protocol.|255216001|258049002|232714002|258049002

A further 10 patients|46053002|116154003

been
treated|28995006
under the revised protocol,|261560009|258049002
with a further two survivors.|46053002|420797005

The anesthetic drug ketamine|373266007|373464007

if
administered|418283001
promptly,
in general|60132005

In unvaccinated humans,|278412004
rabies|14168008|396437008
is
usually fatal|399166001
after neurological symptoms|267070008
have
developed
,
but
prompt postexposure vaccination
may
prevent
the virus|49872002

The Virginia opossum|34244001
is
resistant|30714006
but
not immune|255386009
to rabies.[46]|14168008|396437008

The virus|49872002
is
usually
present|52101004|246105001
in the nerves|3057000
and
saliva|256897009
of a symptomatic rabid animal.|264931009|387961004

The route|284009009
of infection
is
usually,
but
not always,
by a bite.|3404009|25272006

In many cases,|398241000|413769002
the infected animal|387961004
is
exceptionally aggressive,|61372001
may
attack|217315002|216299002

After a typical human infection|278412004
by bite,|3404009|25272006
the virus|49872002
enters|417985001

the virus|49872002
reaches|282679008
the brain,|12738006|258335003
it rapidly|418694008
causes|134198009
encephalitis,|45170000
the prodromal phase,|288480009
and
is
the beginning|255395001
of the symptoms.

Once the patient|116154003
becomes
symptomatic, treatment|264931009|276239002|264931009|416118004
is
almost never effective|255403003|254648000
and
mortality|409651001
is
over 99%.|21481007

Rabies|14168008|396437008
may
also
inflame
the spinal cord,|2748008|180959008
producing
transverse myelitis.[52][53]|16631009

The rabies virus|59881000
survives
in widespread,|85333001
varied
,
rural fauna reservoirs.|257687008

It
is
present|52101004|246105001
in the animal populations|387961004|385436007
of almost
every country|223369002
in the world,
except
in Australia|223621005
and
New Zealand.|223625001

Australian bat lyssavirus (ABLV)|426972006
discovered
in 1996
is
similar
to rabies,|14168008|396437008
and
is
believed to
be
prevalent
in native bat populations.|263818007|388074005|385436007

In some countries,|223369002
such as those in western Europe|52101004|223658005|18720000|223658005
and
Oceania,|223501002
rabies|14168008|396437008
is
considered to
be
prevalent
among bat populations only._[citation|388074005|385436007

of the Americas,
and
large parts|255509001|260726005

Mandatory vaccination
of animals|387961004
is

in rural areas.|42798000

Especially
in developing countries,|223369002
pets
may
not
be
privately

and
their destruction|64597002
may
be
unacceptable.

Oral vaccines|260548002|398827000
can
be
safely
distributed
in baits,

that
has
successfully reduced rabies|260400001|14168008|260400001|396437008
in rural areas|42798000
of Canada,|223686002

India|223600005
has
the highest rate|75540009|371879000
of human rabies|398446008
in the world,
primarily
because of stray dogs,|448771007

followed|367409002
by Thailand|223594002
;
in these countries,|223369002
the virus|49872002
is
primarily
transmitted|60117003|258150004
through canines|448771007
(feral dogs|448771007
and
other wild canine species|74964007|262290003|448771007
).

Another source|260753009
of rabies|14168008|396437008
in Asia|223500001
is
the pet boom.

In 2006 China|223581004
introduced|127487003
the "one-dog policy"|421379005|448771007|421379005
in Beijing to
control|31509003
the problem.[59]|55607006

Rabies|14168008|396437008
is
common|72906007
among wild animals|262290003|387961004
in the
US.

Bats,|388074005
raccoons,|388594007
skunks|388517001
and
foxes
account
for almost
all reported cases|229059009|398241000|229059009|413769002|223458004|398241000|223458004|413769002
(98%
in 2009
).

Rabid bats|388074005
are
found|404684003
in all 48 contiguous states.|65424008|398070004

Other reservoirs|74964007|257687008
are
more
limited|255469002
geographically
;
for example,
the raccoon rabies virus variant|388594007|59881000|40885006
is
only
found|404684003
in a relatively narrow band|18043004|77541009|18043004|255281001|25659002|77541009|25659002|255281001|134223000|77541009|134223000|255281001
along the East Coast.

Due to a high public awareness|75540009|312012004|371879000|312012004
of the virus,|49872002
efforts|19487008
at vaccination
of domestic animals
and
curtailment
of feral populations,|385436007
and
availability|103328004
of postexposure prophylaxis,|409516001
incidents
of rabies|14168008|396437008
in humans|278412004
are
very rare.|260358002|84638005|260358002|103356009

A total|258755000|255619001
of 49 cases|398241000|413769002
of the disease|64572001
were
reported|229059009|223458004
in the country|223369002
in 1995-2011
;
of these,
11
are
thought|88952004
to
have
been
acquired|255396000
abroad.

Almost all domestically acquired cases|255396000|398241000|255396000|413769002
are
attributed|246061005
to
bat|388074005
bites.[60]|3404009

The rabies virus|59881000
is
the type species|261664005|69658003
of the Lyssavirus genus,|112368004|18511007
in the family _Rhabdoviridae_,|407326003
order _Mononegavirales_.|373619001

Lyssaviruses|112368004
have
helical symmetry,|13732004|18772005|86153000|18772005
with a length|410668003
of about 180 nm
and
a cross-section|65145006|62083003|65145006|118630004
of about 75 nm.

These viruses|49872002
are
enveloped
and
have
a single-stranded RNA genome|125681006|27888000|18470003|50607009|27888000|18470003
with negative sense.|260385009|106148006

The genetic information|3950001|255395001
is
packed|53999001
as a ribonucleoprotein complex|103360007
in which RNA|27888000
is
tightly
bound|75958009|257768005|418131003
by the viral nucleoprotein.|71185007

The RNA genome|27888000|18470003
of the virus|49872002
encodes
five genes|421820001|67271001
whose
order
is
highly|75540009
conserved
:
nucleoprotein (N),|71185007
phosphoprotein (P),
matrix protein|88878007
(M|258311008
)
,
glycoprotein (G),|59804006
and
the viral RNA polymerase|74521006
(L).[61]|258995007|420559008

Once
within a muscle|91727004
or
nerve cell,|47220008
the virus|49872002
undergoes
replication.|74256009

The trimeric spikes
on the exterior
of the membrane|83097008
of the virus|49872002
interact
with a specific cell receptor,|69658003|4421005|116647005|69658003|362837007|116647005
the most likely one|4757001|2931005|421379005
being
the acetylcholine receptor.|20685001

The cellular membrane pinches|53982002|242905004
in a procession
known|36692007
as pinocytosis
and
allows
entry
of the virus|49872002
into the cell|4421005|362837007
by way
of an endosome.

The virus then|49872002
uses|277889008|394850002|260676000|419385000
the acidic environment|34957004|276339004
of
that endosome
and
binds|257768005
to its membrane simultaneously,|83097008|79970003
releasing|129299003
its five proteins|421820001|88878007
and
single strand RNA|125681006|27888000|50607009|27888000
into the cytoplasm.[28]

The L protein then|258995007|88878007|420559008|88878007
transcribes
five mRNA strands|421820001|69908008
and
a positive strand|258758003|10828004
of RNA|27888000
all
from the original negative strand RNA|19535007|260385009|27888000
using|260676000
free nucleotides|37837009|71211001
in the cytoplasm.

These five mRNA strands|421820001|69908008
are
then
translated
into their corresponding proteins|88878007
(P,|20304007
L,|258995007|420559008
N,|258310009
G|258795003
and
M proteins|88878007
)
at free ribosomes|37837009|26761006
in the cytoplasm.

Some proteins|88878007
require
post-translative modifications.|243326001

For example,
the G protein travels|22185007|420008001
through the rough endoplasmic reticulum,|24155001
where
it
undergoes
further folding,|46053002|10942006
and
is
then
transported|57188001|360300001
to the Golgi apparatus,|65251009
where
a sugar group|2331003|261586004|2331003|160481000|2331003|389109008|74801000|261586004|74801000|160481000|74801000|389109008
is
added
to it
(glycosylation.[28]

Where there
are
enough proteins,|88878007
the viral polymerase
will
begin|255395001
to
synthesize
new negative strands|7147002|260385009
of RNA|27888000
from the template
of the positive strand RNA.|258758003|27888000|10828004|27888000

These negative strands|260385009
will
then
form|246176004
complexes|103360007
with the N,|258310009
P,|20304007
L|258995007|420559008
and
M proteins|88878007
and
then
travel|420008001
to the inner membrane|260521003|83097008
of the cell,|4421005|362837007
where
a G protein|22185007
has
embedded
itself
in the membrane.|83097008

The G protein then|22185007
coils|261363007
around the N-P-L-M complex|258310009|103360007
of proteins|88878007
taking|419652001
some
of the host cell membrane|53982002
with it,
which
will
form|246176004
the new outer envelope|7147002|261074009
of the virus particle.|285296008

The virus then buds|49872002
from the cell.[28]|4421005|362837007

From the point
of entry,
the virus|49872002
is
neurotropic,
traveling|420008001
quickly
along the neural pathways|3057000|256864008
into the central nervous system,|21483005|278199004
and
then
to other organs.|74964007|410653004

The salivary glands|75535001
receive
high concentrations|75540009|82742001|371879000|82742001
of the virus,|49872002
thus
allowing
further transmission.|46053002|258150004

The term
is
derived
from the Latin _rabies_,|14168008|396437008
"
madness
".

This,
in turn,|282987006
may
be
related|272151006|262094002
to the Sanskrit _rabhas_,
"to do violence".

The Greeks|1451003
derived
the word _lyssa_,|255373000|14168008
from _lud_
or
"violent"
;
this root|85077000|2338009
is
used|394850002
in the name
of the genus|18511007
of rabies _Lyssavirus_.[63]|14168008|112368004|396437008|112368004

Because of its potentially violent nature,|277302009
rabies|14168008|396437008
has
been
known|36692007
since _circa_ 2000 B.C.

The first written record|255216001|12261009|232714002|12261009
of rabies|14168008|396437008
is
in the Mesopotamian Codex
of Eshnunna
(circa 1930 BC
)
,
which
dictates
that
the owner
of a dog showing symptoms|448771007
of rabies|14168008|396437008
should
take|419652001
preventive measure|262073000|246445000|262073000|272391002|129428001|246445000|129428001|272391002
against bites.|3404009

If
another person|125676002
were
bitten|3404009|25272006
by a rabid dog|448771007
and
later
died,|419620001|419099009
the owner
was
heavily
fined.[65]|3082000|264695004

Rabies|14168008|396437008
was
considered
a scourge
for its prevalence
in the 19th century.

In France|223666001
and
Belgium,|223660007
where Saint Hubert
was
venerated
,
the "St Hubert's Key"
was
heated|88999006
and
applied|410618006
to
cauterize|27411008
the wound|13924000
;
by an application|410618006
of magical thinking,|40077001
dogs|448771007
were
branded
with the key
in hopes|247798006
of protecting
them
from rabies.|14168008|396437008

Fear|1402001
of rabies|14168008|396437008
related|272151006|262094002
to methods|260686004|272394005
of transmissions|258150004
was
almost irrational|78205008
;[63] however,
this
gave|419582001
Louis Pasteur ample opportunity to
test|269814003|272393004
postexposure treatments|276239002
from 1885.

In ancient medical times,|74188005|410669006|74188005|417929005
the attachment|1431002
of the tongue|21974007|181226008
(
the frenum linguae,|21974007
a mucous membrane|313268005
)
was
cut|283396008
and
removed|127485006
as this
is
where rabies|14168008|396437008
was
thought|88952004
to
originate.

This practice
ceased
with the discovery
of the actual cause|134198009
of rabies.[67]|14168008|396437008

Rabies|14168008|396437008
is
infectious
to mammals|387976007
;
three stages|421291004|261612004
are
recognized.

The first stage|258215001
is
a one-|421379005
to three-day period|421291004|258703001|259037005|421291004|259032004|259037005
characterized
by behavioral changes|315244000
and
is
known|36692007
as the prodromal stage.|21191007|371508000|261612004

The second|81170007|257997001|288495006
is
the excitative stage,|21191007|371508000|261612004
which
lasts
three|421291004
to four days.|421534005|258703001

This stage|21191007|371508000|261612004
is
often|70232002
known|36692007
as "furious rabies"|14168008|396437008
for the tendency
of the affected animal to|116689002
be
hyper-reactive|44548000|11214006
to external stimuli|261074009|8927009
and
bite|3404009|25272006
at anything near.|277752003

The third|70905002
is
the paralytic stage|21191007|371508000|261612004
and
is
caused|23981006|134198009
by damage|37782003
to motor neurons.|31513005

Incoordination|281016006
is
seen
owing to rear limb paralysis,|66019005|44695005|243996003|44695005
and
drooling|62718007
and
difficulty swallowing|40739000
is
caused|23981006|134198009
by paralysis|44695005
of facial|89545001
and
throat muscles.|54066008|91727004|49928004|91727004|264231000|91727004

Death|419620001|268923008
is
usually
caused|23981006|134198009
by respiratory arrest.[68]|248583008|264697007|87317003|264697007

Rabies|14168008|396437008
has
the advantage
over other pseudotyping methods|272394005
for gene delivery|67271001|236973005|67271001|118215003
in
that
the cell-targeting|4421005|362837007
(tissue tropism|85756007
is
more specific|242762006|69658003
for difficult-to-|52925006
reach|282679008
sites,|10546003
such as the central nervous system|21483005|278199004
without invasive delivery methods,|10179008
as well as
being
capable
of retrograde tracing|312004007|103363009
(i.e.,|42146005|22971001
going
against the flow
of information
at synapses|69147006
in neuronal circuits.[69]|47220008|264698002
