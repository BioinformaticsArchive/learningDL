(!
play|300776002
/?
me?n?/|258310009
is
a class|258391009
of skin diseases|95320005
caused|23981006|134198009
by parasitic mites.|84073006

Since
mites also|84073006
infect
plants,|31006001
birds,|387972009
and
reptiles,|107241004
the term "mange",|128867006
suggesting
poor condition|11403006|260905004|255351007|260905004
of the hairy coat|386045008|228224007|119326000|228224007
due to the infection,
is
sometimes
reserved
only
for pathological mite-infestation|394595002|240885009|29458008|240885009
of nonhuman mammals.|387976007

Thus,
mange|128867006
includes|55919000
mite-associated skin disease|84073006|47429007|95320005
in domestic animals
(cats|448169003|388618001
and
dogs|448771007
)
,
in livestock
(
such as sheep scab,|36776009
and
in wild animals|262290003|387961004
(
for example,
coyotes,|8909006
cougars,|388747002
and
bears.|106970005

Since
mites|84073006
belong
to the arachnid subclass Acari|76222001|444840003
(also called Acarina|106830004
)
,
another term
for mite infestation|240885009
is
acariasis.|240885009

Parasitic mites|84073006
that
cause|23981006|134198009
mange|128867006
in mammals|387976007
embed
themselves
either
in skin|119325001|39937001|181469002
or
hair follicles|67290009
in the animal,|387961004
depending
upon their genus.|18511007

_Sarcoptes_ spp.|13228009

burrow|60341009
into skin,|119325001|39937001|181469002
while
_Demodex_ spp.|25873009

live|419749002
in follicles.|24162005|67290009

In humans,|278412004
these two types|420797005|261664005
of mite infections,|84073006
which
would
otherwise
be
known|36692007
as "mange"|128867006
in furry mammals,|159966006|387976007
are
instead
known|36692007
,
respectively,
as
scabies|128869009
and
demodicosis.|413965001

However,
the mites|84073006
that
cause|23981006|134198009
these diseases|64572001
in humans|278412004
are
closely
related|272151006|262094002
to those
that
cause|23981006|134198009
the mange|128867006
in other mammals.|74964007|387976007

Two types|420797005|261664005
of pet-associated mites|47429007|84073006
afflict
dogs|448771007
and
cats|448169003|388618001
with a type|261664005
of hair-|386045008|119326000
losing
dermatitis,|182782007
and
each type|261664005
has
characteristic symptoms.

Also
called
*
*demodicosis|413965001
*
*
or
*
*red mange|386713009|128867006|371240000|128867006
*
*,
demodectic mange|413965001
is
caused|23981006|134198009
by a sensitivity|35209006|365705006
to
and
overpopulation
of _Demodex canis_|82940001
if
the animal's immune system|387961004|116003000
is
unable to|371151008
keep
the mites|84073006
under control.|31509003

The two types|420797005|261664005
of demodectic mange|413965001
are
localized|255471002
and
generalized.|60132005

Localized|255471002
consists
of four spots|421534005|271807003|421534005|285305004
or
less.|276139006|263796003

Most dogs|448771007
are
immune|255386009
to demodectic mange,|413965001
however dogs|448771007
with compromised immune systems|116003000
and
the elderly|105436006
are
at a higher risk.|15508007

It
is
not contagious
to humans.|278412004

A type|261664005
of demodetic infection
in humans|278412004
is
known,|36692007
but
is
less commonly symptomatic.|276139006|264931009|263796003|264931009

See|281004000
_Demodex folliculorum_.|73643001

Also
known|36692007
as
*
*canine scabies|44065001
*
*,
sarcoptic mange|128868001
is
a highly contagious infestation|75540009|17322007|75540009|75540009|75540009|33042004
of _Sarcoptes scabiei canis_,|74466004
a burrowing mite.|60341009|84073006

The canine sarcoptic mite|448771007|84073006|84073006
can
also infest cats,|448169003|388618001
pigs,|106996007|78678003
horses,|35354009
sheep|388254009|255392003
and
various other species.|256220008|69658003

The human analog|278412004
of burrowing mite infection,|60341009|84073006
due to a closely related species,|272151006|69658003|262094002|69658003
is
called scabies|128869009
(
the "seven year itch"|420359007|258707000|424492005|420359007|259039008|424492005
).

All
these burrowing mites|60341009|84073006
are
in the family Sarcoptidae.|106847003

They
dig
into
and
through the skin,|119325001|39937001|181469002
causing|23981006
intense itching|103370009|424492005
from an allergic reaction|421961002
to the mite,|84073006
and
crusting|69640009
that
can
quickly
become
infected.

Hair loss|278040002
and
crusting frequently|69640009|70232002
appear
first|255216001|232714002
on elbows|127949000
and
ears.|117590005|1910005

Skin damage|119325001|37782003|39937001|37782003|181469002|37782003
can
occur|272120004
from the dog's intense scratching|283111009|103370009
and
biting.|3404009

Secondary skin infection|264569006|119325001|264569006|39937001|264569006|181469002|2603003|108365000|81170007|108365000
is
also common.|72906007

Dogs|448771007
with chronic sarcoptic mange|90734009|128868001
are
often|70232002
in poor condition,|11403006|260905004|255351007|260905004
and
in
both
animals|387961004
and
humans,|278412004
immune suppression|86553008
from starvation|212968006
or
any other disease|74964007|64572001
causes|134198009
this type|261664005
of mange to|128867006
develop
into a highly|75540009
crusted|33342007
form|246176004
in which
the burden
of mites|84073006
is
far higher|46053002|75540009|46053002|371879000
than
in healthy specimens.|263775005|123038009

Dogs|448771007
affected|247591002|248448006
with demodectic mange|413965001
do
not
need|410525008|103325001
to
be
isolated|46651001
from other dogs.|74964007|448771007|74964007

Demodectic mange|413965001
is
generally only contagious
from mother|72705000
to pup
during suckling
;
it
is
not contagious
after weaning.|37328000

Many puppies|260396001
will
grow out
of demodectic mange|413965001
as their immune systems|116003000
mature,|34071009
but
it
can
recur|246455001
if
the immune system|116003000
is
compromised,
such as
after
steroid treatment|297279009
or
other immunocompromising illness.|74964007|370391006|39104002

In cases|398241000|413769002
of sarcoptic mange,|128868001
affected dogs|247591002|448771007|247591002|248448006|448771007|248448006
need|410525008|103325001
to
be
isolated|46651001
from other dogs|74964007|448771007|74964007
and
their bedding,
and
places|257557008
they
have
occupied
must
be
thoroughly
cleaned.|228402009

Other dogs|74964007|448771007|74964007
in contact|52101004|11723008|52101004|70862002|18720000|11723008|18720000|70862002
with a diagnosed case|439401001|398241000
should
be
evaluated
and
treated.|28995006

A number|410680006|410681005
of parasitical treatments|276239002
are
useful
in treating canine scabies.|28995006|44065001

Sulfurated lime|34330005|227430006
(
a mixture|272163001
of calcium polysulfides|5540006
)
rinses
applied|410618006
weekly|14497002
or
biweekly|20050000
are
effective|255403003|254648000
(
the concentrated form|246176004
for use|277889008|419385000
on plants|31006001
as a fungicide|19209005
must
be
diluted|421399004
1
:
16
or
1
:
32
for use|277889008|419385000
on animal skin|51890009
).

Selamectin
is
licensed
for treatment|276239002|416118004
in dogs|448771007
by veterinary prescription|53216000|260885003
in several countries|261028005|223369002
;
it
is
applied|410618006
as a dose directly|277406006|408102007
to the skin,|119325001|39937001|181469002
once
per month|258706009|259036001
(
the drug|410942007
does
not
wash
off
).

A related|272151006|262094002
and
older drug ivermectin|70753007|410942007|387559003
is
also effective|255403003|254648000
and
can
be
given|419582001
by mouth|74262004|123851003|21082005|181220002
for two|420797005
to four weekly treatments|421534005|14497002|276239002
or
until two negative skin scrapings|420797005|260385009|119325001|258431006|420797005|260385009|39937001|258431006|420797005|260385009|181469002|258431006
are
achieved.

Oral ivermectim|260548002
is
not safe to
use|277889008|419385000
on some collie-|19078005
like herding dogs,|418788006|448771007|418788006
however,
due to possible homozygous MDR1|371930009|22061001|60022001|22061001
(P-glycoprotein mutations|20304007|59804006|55446002
that
increase|260366006
its toxicity
by allowing
it
into the brain.|12738006|258335003

Ivermectin injections|387559003|28289002|387559003|129326001
are
also effective|255403003|254648000
and
given|419582001
in
either
weekly|14497002
or
every two weeks|420797005|258705008
in one|421379005
to four doses,|421534005|277406006
although
the same MDR1 dog restrictions|262126009|448771007|263856008|262126009|263856008
apply.|410618006|417924000

Topical 0.01% ivermectin|387559003|359540000|387559003
in oil|21847005|421890007
(Acarexx
has
been
reported|229059009|223458004
to
be
effective|255403003|254648000
in humans,|278412004
and
all mite infections|84073006
in many types|261664005
of animals|387961004
(especially
in ear mite infections|129127001|84073006|51255008
where the animal|387961004
cannot
lick|38090009
the treated area|28995006|42798000
)
,
and
is
so poorly|223528007|556001
absorbed
that systemic toxicity|105891008
is
less likely|276139006|2931005|263796003|2931005
in these sites.|10546003

Nevertheless,
topical ivermectin|387559003|359540000|387559003
has
not
been
well enough|20572008
tested|272393004
to
be
approved|9571008
for this use|277889008|419385000
in dogs,|448771007
and
is
theoretically much more dangerous
in zones
where the animal|387961004
can
potentially
lick|38090009
the treated area.|28995006|42798000

Selamectin
applied|410618006
to the skin|119325001|39937001|181469002
(i.e.,|42146005|22971001
topically
)
has
some
of the same theoretical problems|262126009|55607006
in collies|19078005
and
MDR1 dogs|448771007
as ivermectim,
but
it
has
nevertheless
been
approved|9571008
for use|277889008|419385000
for all dogs|448771007
provided that
the animal|387961004
can
be
observed
for 8 hours|123034006
after the first monthly treatment.|255216001|89185003|276239002|255216001|89185003|416118004|232714002|89185003|276239002|232714002|89185003|416118004

Similar treatments,|276239002
including|55919000
monthly selamectin,|89185003
are
used|394850002
in cats|448169003|388618001
with mange.|128867006

A notable difference|263735002
for cat treatment|448169003|276239002|448169003|416118004|33384004|276239002|33384004|416118004|388626009|276239002|388626009|416118004
is
that permethrin,|410457007|333111009
which
can
be
used|394850002
in
both
dogs|448771007
and
humans|278412004
with this condition,|260905004
cannot
be
used|394850002
in cats.|448169003|388618001

The differences|263735002
in cat|448169003|33384004|388626009
and
dog treatment|448771007|276239002|448771007|416118004|276239002|416118004
are
not
due to differences|263735002
in the mites|84073006
so
much
as the mitocides
which
are
poisonous|35331000
to the host.

of sarcoptic infection

scabies.|128869009

For demodetic infection
in humans,|278412004
which
is
not
as severe|24484000
as
it
is
in animals|387961004
with thicker coats|246703001|228224007
(
such as dogs|448771007
)
,

_Demodex folliculorum_.|73643001

Veterinarians usually|106290006
attempt
diagnosis|439401001
with skin scrapings|119325001|258431006|39937001|258431006|181469002|258431006
from multiple areas,|260396001|42798000
which
are
then
examined|64049009
under a microscope|65473004
for mites.|84073006

_Sarcoptes_,|13228009
because
they
may
be
present|52101004|246105001
in relatively low numbers,|62482003|410680006|62482003|410681005|371880002|410680006|371880002|410681005
and
because
they
are
often|70232002
removed|127485006
by dogs|448771007
chewing|1202003|419747000
at themselves,
may
be
difficult to|52925006
demonstrate.

As a result,|394617004
diagnosis|439401001
in sarcoptic mange|128868001
is
often|70232002
based|418836005
on symptoms
rather than
actual confirmation|74996004
of the presence|386397008
of mites.|84073006

A common|72906007
and
simple way|13673007
of determining
if
a dog|448771007
has
mange|128867006
is
if
it
displays
what
is
called
a "pedal-pinna reflex",|56459004|181176000|87572000|56459004|181176000|106146005|56459004|113327001|87572000|56459004|113327001|106146005|56459004|421159007|87572000|56459004|421159007|106146005
which
is
when
the dog|448771007
moves|302000008
one|421379005
of its hind legs|30021000
in a scratching motion|40590001|56219004|53181008|56219004
as the ear|117590005|1910005
is
being
manipulated|129408000
and
scratched|53181008
gently|418449005
by the examiner
;
because
the mites|84073006
proliferate
on the ear margins|117590005|112233002|117590005|82868003|117590005|372249001|1910005|112233002|1910005|82868003|1910005|372249001
in nearly
all cases|398241000|413769002
at some point,
this method|260686004|272394005
works|261041009
over 95%
of the time.|410669006

It
is
helpful
in cases|398241000|413769002
where all symptoms
of mange|128867006
are
present|52101004|246105001
but
no mites|84073006
are
observed
with a microscope.|65473004

In some countries,|223369002
a serologic test|68793005
is
available|103328004
that
may
be
useful
in diagnosis.|439401001
