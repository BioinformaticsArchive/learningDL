*Myocarditis|50920009
*
*
or
*
*inflammatory cardiomyopathy|57809008
*
*
is
inflammation|257552002
of heart muscle|74281007
(myocardium.|74281007

Myocarditis|50920009
is
most often|4757001|70232002
due to infection
by common viruses,|72906007|49872002
such as parvovirus B19,|63603005
less commonly nonviral pathogens|276139006|264418008|263796003|264418008
such as _Borrelia burgdorferi_|76327009
(Lyme disease|23502006
)
or
_Trypanosoma cruzi_,|88274000
or
as a hypersensitivity response|421961002|421369008
to drugs.[1]|410942007

The definition
of myocarditis|50920009
varies
,
but
the central feature|26216008
is
an infection
of the heart,|80891009|302509004
with an inflammatory infiltrate,|47351003
and
damage|37782003
to the heart muscle,|74281007
_
without_
the blockage
of coronary arteries|41801008
that
define
a heart attack|22298006
(myocardial infarction|22298006
or
other common noninfectious causes.|74964007|72906007|134198009

Myocarditis|50920009
may
or
may
not
include|55919000
death|419620001|268923008
(necrosis|6574001
of heart tissue.|386108004

It
may
include|55919000
dilated cardiomyopathy.[1]|195021004

Myocarditis|50920009
is
often|70232002
an autoimmune reaction.|263680009

Streptococcal M protein|58800005|88878007
and
coxsackievirus B|186658007
have
regions|410673009
(epitopes|52078008
that
are
immunologically similar
to cardiac myosin.|80891009|23038005

During
and
after the viral infection,|34014006
the immune system|116003000
may
attack|217315002|216299002
cardiac myosin.[1]|80891009|23038005

Because
a definitive diagnosis|261002007|439401001|261002007
requires
a heart biopsy,|197042001
which doctors|309343006
are
reluctant to do because
they
are
invasive, statistics|10179008
on the incidence
of myocarditis|50920009
vary
widely.[1]

The consequences|103332005
of myocarditis thus also|50920009
vary
widely.

It
can
cause|23981006|134198009
a mild disease|255604002|64572001
without any symptoms
that
resolves
itself,
or
it
may
cause|23981006|134198009
chest pain,|29857009
heart failure,|84114007|42343007
or
sudden death.|26636000|95281009

An acute myocardial infarction-|57054005
like syndrome
with normal coronary arteries|371860003
has
a good prognosis.|170968001

Heart failure,|84114007|42343007
even
with dilated left ventricle,|6210001|7771000|255381004|87878005|255381004|244385005
may
have
a good prognosis.|170968001

Ventricular arrhythmias|44103008
and
high-degree heart block|75540009|258395000|233916004|75540009|246173007|233916004|371879000|258395000|233916004|371879000|246173007|233916004
have
a poor prognosis.|170969009

Loss
of right ventricular function|250938005
is
a strong predictor|260404005
of death.[1]|419620001|268923008

The signs|72670004
and
symptoms
associated|47429007
with myocarditis|50920009
are
varied
,
and
relate|272151006|262094002
either
to the actual inflammation|257552002
of the myocardium,|74281007
or
the weakness|13791008|260407003
of the heart muscle|74281007
that
is
secondary|2603003|81170007
to the inflammation.|257552002

Signs|72670004
and
symptoms
of myocarditis|50920009

:
[3]|260313008

Since
myocarditis|50920009
is
often|70232002
due to a viral illness,|34014006
many patients|116154003
give|419582001
a history|392521001
of symptoms
consistent|385433004
with a recent viral infection,|6493001|34014006
including|55919000
fever,|386661006
rash,|271807003
diarrhea,|398032003
joint pains,|57676002
and
easy fatigueability.|36203004|79915001

Myocarditis|50920009
is
often|70232002
associated|47429007
with pericarditis,|3238004
and
many patients|260396001|116154003
present|52101004|246105001
with signs|72670004
and
symptoms
that
suggest
concurrent myocarditis|68405009|50920009
and
pericarditis.|3238004

A large number|255509001|410680006|255509001|410681005
of causes|134198009
of myocarditis|50920009
have
been
identified|7882003
,
but
often|70232002
a cause|134198009
cannot
be
found.|404684003

In Europe|223502009
and
North America,|223503004
viruses|49872002
are
common culprits.|72906007

Worldwide,
however,
the most common cause|4757001|72906007|134198009
is
Chagas' disease,|77506005
an illness|39104002
endemic
to Central|26216008
and
South America|223504005
that
is
due to infection
by the protozoan _Trypanosoma cruzi_.[3]|417396000|88274000

Bacterial myocarditis|64043005
is
rare|84638005|103356009
in patients|116154003
without immunodeficiency.|234532001

Myocarditis refers|50920009|439980006
to an underlying process|415178003
that
causes|134198009
inflammation|257552002
and
injury
of the heart.|80891009|302509004

It
does
not
refer|439980006
to inflammation|257552002
of the heart|80891009|302509004
as a consequence|103332005
of some other insult.|74964007

Many secondary causes,|2603003|134198009|81170007|134198009
such as a heart attack,|22298006
can
lead|88488004
to inflammation|257552002
of the myocardium|74281007
and
therefore
the diagnosis|439401001
of myocarditis|50920009
cannot
be
made
by evidence|18669006
of inflammation|257552002
of the myocardium alone.[6]|74281007|105529008

Myocardial inflammation|50920009
can
be
suspected|415684004
on the basis|418836005
of electrocardiographic (ECG) results,|394617004|29303009|394617004
elevated C-reactive protein (CRP)|75540009|61425002|75540009|55235003
and/or
Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR)|416838001|365649001
and
increased IgM|35105006|260366006
(serology|68793005
against viruses|49872002
known|36692007
to
affect|4065008
the myocardium.|74281007

Markers
of myocardial damage|74281007|37782003
(troponin|102680009
or
creatine kinase cardiac isoenzymes|59435008|80891009
)
are
elevated.[3]|75540009

The ECG findings most commonly|102592004
seen
in myocarditis|50920009
are
diffuse T wave inversions|19648000|59931005
;
saddle-shaped ST-segment elevations|71712007|76388001
may
be
present|52101004|246105001
(
these
are
also
seen
in pericarditis|3238004
).[3]|260313008

The gold standard|2309006|371256005
is
still biopsy|86273004
of the myocardium,|74281007
generally
done
in the setting
of angiography.|77343006

A small tissue sample|255507004|119376003
of the endocardium|304059001|119378002
and
myocardium|74281007
is
taken,|419652001
and
investigated|116698004
by a pathologist|61207006
by light microscopy|104157003
and?
if necessary?immunochemistry
and
special staining methods.|67995009|127790008

Histopathological features|394597005
are
myocardial interstitium|74281007
with abundant edema|423666004
and
inflammatory infiltrate,|47351003
rich|224166006
in lymphocytes|56972008|446325007
and
macrophages.|58986001

Focal destruction|87017008|64597002
of myocytes
explains
the myocardial pump failure.[3]|84114007|44668000|44668000

Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging|80891009|113091000
(cMRI
or
CMR|223521001
)
has
been
shown
to
be
very useful|260358002
in diagnosing myocarditis|439401001|50920009
by visualizing markers|255374006
for inflammation|257552002
of the myocardium.|74281007

Recently,|6493001
consensus criteria
for the diagnosis|439401001
of myocarditis|50920009
by CMR|223521001
have
been
published
[8]

As most viral infections|34014006
cannot
be
treated|28995006
with directed therapy,|276239002
symptomatic treatment|264931009|276239002|264931009|416118004
is
the only|50607009|420295001
form|246176004
of therapy|276239002
for those forms|246176004
of myocarditis.|50920009

In the acute phase,|255251009
supportive therapy,|243114000
including|55919000
bed rest,|225316001|17535004
is
indicated.|410535002

For symptomatic patients,|264931009|116154003
digoxin|387461009|25514001
and
diuretics|372695000
provide
clinical improvement.|58147004

For patients|116154003
with moderate|6736007
to severe dysfunction,|24484000|386585008
cardiac function|86185002
can
be
supported|9096001|243114000
by use|277889008|419385000
of inotropes
such as Milrinone|373441005
in the acute phase,|255251009
followed|367409002
by oral therapy|260548002|276239002
with ACE inhibitors|372733002
(Captopril,|387160004
Lisinopril|386873009
)
when
tolerated.

People|125676002
who
do
not
respond
to conventional therapy|255333006|276239002
are
candidates
for bridge therapy|277035007|276239002
with left ventricular assist devices.|360066001

Heart transplantation|32413006
is
reserved
for patients|116154003
who
fail
to
improve|385425000|3442003|385633008
with conventional therapy.[10]|255333006|276239002

In several small case series|261028005|255507004|398241000|13039001
and
randomized control trials,|31509003|110465008
systemic corticosteroids|31099001|79440004
have
shown
to
have
beneficial effects|253861007
in patients|116154003
with proven myocarditis.|277025001|50920009

However,
data
on the usefulness
of corticosteroids|79440004
should
be
interpreted|363714003
with caution,
since
58%
of adults|133936004
recover|74822006
spontaneously,
while
most
studies|110465008|224699009
on children|410601007|160499008
and
infants|418119000
lack|41277001
control groups.[9]|31509003|261586004|31509003|160481000

The exact incidence
of myocarditis|50920009
is
unknown.|261665006

However,
in series|52101004|13039001|18720000|13039001
of routine autopsies,|50811001|168461002
1?9%|260305007
of all patients|116154003
had
evidence|18669006
of myocardial inflammation.|50920009

In young adults,|84422007|133936004
up to 20%
of all cases|398241000|413769002
of sudden death|26636000|95281009
are
due to myocarditis.[3]|50920009

Among patients|116154003
with HIV,|19030005|86406008|402916007
myocarditis|50920009
is
the most common cardiac pathological finding|4757001|72906007|301095005|394595002|4757001|72906007|301095005|29458008
at autopsy,|168461002
with a prevalence
of 50%
or
more.[1]|242762006
