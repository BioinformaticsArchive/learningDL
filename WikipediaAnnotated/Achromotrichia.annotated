*Hair color|80040005
*
*
is
the pigmentation|263839000
of hair follicles|67290009
due to two types|420797005|261664005
of melanin|59094002
:
eumelanin
and
pheomelanin.

Generally,
if
more eumelanin|242762006
is
present,|52101004|246105001
the color|263714004
of the hair|386045008|119326000
is
darker|255419005
;
if
less eumelanin|276139006|263796003
is
present,|52101004|246105001
the hair|386045008|119326000
is
lighter.|75926004

Levels|258395000
of melanin|59094002
can
vary
over time|410669006
causing|23981006
a person's hair|125676002|386045008|125676002|119326000
color|263714004
to
change|243326001|263703002
,
and
it
is
possible to|371930009|60022001
have
hair follicles|67290009
of more|242762006
than one color.|421379005|263714004

Particular hair colors|80040005
are
associated|47429007
with ethnic groups.|397731000

The shades
of human hair color|278412004|80040005
are
assessed
using|260676000
the
*
*Fischer?Saller scale.|19892000|278111002
*
*
The Fischer?Saller scale,|19892000|278111002
named|27468005
after Eugen Fischer
and
Karl Saller,
is
used|394850002
in physical anthropology|5880005|19388002
and
medicine to|410942007
determine
the shades
of hair color.|80040005

The scale|19892000|278111002
uses|277889008|394850002|260676000|419385000
the following designations|255260001|118522005

Two types|420797005|261664005
of pigment|65863008
give|419582001
hair|386045008|119326000
its color|263714004
:
eumelanin
and
pheomelanin.

Pheomelanin
colors|263714004
hair orange|386045008|256306003|386045008|229776000|386045008|371242008|119326000|256306003|119326000|229776000|119326000|371242008
and
yellow.|263935005

Eumelanin,
which
has
two subtypes|420797005|260837004
of black|315240009|413464008|15086000|371252007
or
brown,|371254008
determines
the darkness|255419005
of the hair color.|80040005

A low concentration|62482003|82742001|371880002|82742001
of brown eumelanin|371254008
results|394617004
in blond hair,|297995004
whereas
a higher concentration|75540009|82742001|371879000|82742001
of brown eumelanin|371254008
will
color|263714004
the hair brown.|386045008|371254008|119326000|371254008

High amounts|75540009|107651007|371879000|107651007
of black eumelanin result|315240009|394617004|413464008|394617004|15086000|394617004|371252007|394617004
in black hair,|297998002
while
low concentrations|62482003|82742001|371880002|82742001
give|419582001
gray hair.|297994000

All humans|278412004
have
some pheomelanin
in their hair.|386045008|119326000

Pheomelanin
is
more chemically stable|242762006|441900009|58158008
than black eumelanin,|315240009|413464008|15086000|371252007
but
less chemically stable|276139006|441900009|58158008|263796003|441900009|58158008
than brown eumelanin,|371254008
so
it
breaks
down more slowly|242762006|419443000
when
oxidized.

This
is
why bleach|76885009
gives|419582001
darker hair|255419005|386045008|255419005|119326000
a reddish tinge
during the artificial coloring process.|71967004|263714004|415178003|71967004|103366001|415178003

As the pheomelanin
continues|255238004
to break down,|263690001
the hair|386045008|119326000
will
gradually
become
orange,|256306003|229776000|371242008
then yellow,|263935005
and
finally white.|413773004|185984009|371251000

The genetics
of hair colors|80040005
are
not yet firmly
established.|263748003|385645004

According to one theory,|421379005
at least two gene pairs|276139006|420797005|67271001|263796003|420797005|67271001
control|31509003
human hair color.|278412004|80040005

One phenotype|421379005|8116006|421379005|363778006
(brown/blond|371254008
)
has
a dominant brown allele|371254008|9109004
and
a recessive blond allele.|9109004

A person|125676002
with a brown allele|371254008|9109004
will
have
brown hair|297996003
;
a person|125676002
with no brown alleles|371254008|9109004
will
be
blond.

This
explains
why two brown-haired parents|420797005|297996003|40683002
can
produce
a blond-haired child.|297995004|410601007|297995004|160499008

The other gene pair|74964007|67271001
is
a non-blond/blond pair,
where
the non-blond allele|9109004
(
which
suppresses|245780008
production
of pheomelanin
)
is
dominant
and
the allele|9109004
for blond hair|297995004
is
recessive.

A person|125676002
with two copies|420797005
of the blond-haired allele|297995004|9109004
will
have
blond hair,|297995004
but
it
will
be
either
blondish
or
bright blond orange|221668007|256306003|221668007|229776000|221668007|371242008
depending
on
whether
the first gene pair|255216001|67271001|232714002|67271001
gives|419582001
brown|371254008
or
blond hair,|297995004
respectively.

The two-gene model|420797005|67271001
does
not
account
for all possible shades|371930009|60022001
of brown,|371254008
blond,
or
red|386713009|371240000
(
for example,
platinum blond|84847000
versus
dark blond/light brown|255419005|56242006|371254008|255419005|371268001|371254008
)
,
nor
does
it
explain
why hair color sometimes|80040005
darkens
as a person ages.|125676002|424144002

Several gene pairs|261028005|67271001
control|31509003
the light|56242006|371268001
versus
dark hair color|255419005|386045008|255419005|119326000|255419005|80040005
in a cumulative effect.|253861007

A person's genotype|125676002
for a multifactorial trait
can
interact
with environment to|276339004
produce
varying phenotypes|8116006

Brown hair|297996003
is
characterized
by higher levels|75540009|258395000|371879000|258395000
of eumelanin
and
lower levels|261122009|258395000

Of the two types|420797005|261664005
of eumelanin
(black|315240009|413464008|15086000|371252007
and
brown|371254008
)
,
brown-haired people|297996003|125676002
have
brown eumelanin|371254008
;
they also usually
have
medium-thick strands|255508009|246703001
of hair.|386045008|119326000

Brown-haired people|297996003|125676002
are
often|70232002
known|36692007
as brunette.

Brown hair|297996003
is
a dominant trait.[3]

Blond
(
or
_blonde_
)
hair|386045008|119326000
ranges
from nearly white|413773004|185984009|371251000
(platinum blond,|84847000
tow-haired|386045008|119326000
)
to a dark golden blond.|255419005

Strawberry blond,|102261002
a mixture|272163001
of blond
and
red hair,|297997007
is
a much rarer type|242762006|84638005|261664005|242762006|103356009|261664005|4757001|84638005|261664005|4757001|103356009|261664005
containing|42504009
the most|4757001
amounts|107651007
of pheomelanin.

Blond hair|297995004
can
have
almost
any proportion|8212001
of pheomelanin
and
eumelanin,
but
both
only
in small amounts.|255507004|107651007

More pheomelanin|242762006
creates
a more golden|242762006
blond
color,|263714004
and
more eumelanin|242762006
creates
an ash blond.|256251001

born|106970005|81827009|398209006
with blond hair|297995004
develop
darker hair|255419005|386045008|255419005|119326000
as
they age,|424144002
with the majority
of natural blonds|510009
developing
a hair color|80040005
of a dark "gunmetal" hue|255419005
by the time|410669006
they
reach|282679008
middle age.|28288005

Pregnancy hormones|289908002|87568004

this process.|415178003

Natural blond hair|510009|297995004
is
rare|84638005|103356009
in adulthood,|41847000
with some
reports|229059009|223458004
that only about 2%|50607009|420295001
of the world's population|385436007|389109008
is
naturally
blond.

Blond hair|297995004
is
most commonly|4757001
found|404684003
in Northern
and
Eastern Europeans|414152003
and
their descendants,
but
can
be
found|404684003
spread|410677005
around most
of Europe.|223502009

Blond hair|297995004
is
exceptionally rare|84638005|103356009
among those without European heritage,|45169001|414152003|45169001
however
the Melanesians|23534002
of New Guinea|7147002|223558001
are
one|421379005
of the few non-European races|57176003

the only black race|50607009|315240009|420295001|315240009
known|36692007
to
have
a high blond hair rate.|75540009|297995004|371879000|297995004

This
is
because
the Papuans/Melanesians|17789004|23534002

that naturally
blond
hair|386045008|119326000
of Melanesians|23534002
are
caused|23981006|134198009
by a recessive mutation|55446002

Red hair|297997007
ranges
from light strawberry blond|56242006|102261002|371268001|102261002
shades

It
is
caused|23981006|134198009
by a variation|40885006
in the _Mc1r_ gene|67271001
and
is
recessive.

Red hair|297997007
has
the highest amounts|75540009|107651007|371879000|107651007
of pheomelanin,
around 67%,
and
usually low levels|62482003|258395000|371880002|258395000
of eumelanin.

At 1-2%
of the population,|385436007|389109008
it
is
the least common hair color|276139006|72906007|80040005|263796003|72906007|80040005
in the world.

It

most prominently|4757001
found|404684003
in Scotland|223678002

of redheads|17283002
;
13 percent|118582008
of the population|385436007|389109008

Gray|229029004|371253002
or
white hair?sometimes colloquially|297993006
called
"salt and pepper"|387390002|103582004|387390002|412066006
when
it
is
'
peppered|103582004|412066006

not
caused|23981006|134198009
by a true gray|31874001|229029004|31874001|371253002
or
white pigment,|413773004|65863008|185984009|65863008|371251000|65863008
but
is
due to a lack|41277001
of pigmentation|263839000
and
melanin.|59094002

The clear hairs|263707001|386045008
appear
as gray|229029004|371253002
or
white|413773004|185984009|371251000
because of the way light|56242006|371268001
reflects|225436004
from the hairs.|386045008

Gray hair|297994000
color|263714004
typically
occurs|272120004
naturally
as people age|125676002|424144002
(
see|281004000
"Effects|253861007
of aging|248280005
on hair color",|80040005
below
).

For some people|125676002
this
can
happen
at a very young age|260358002|84422007|424144002
(
for example,
at the age|424144002
of 10
).

The same|262126009
is
true|31874001
for white hair.|297993006

In some cases,|398241000|413769002
gray hair|297994000
may
be
caused|23981006|134198009
by thyroid deficiencies,|69748006|260372006|69748006|248325000|61020000|260372006|61020000|248325000
Waardenburg syndrome
or
a vitamin B12 deficiency.|190634004

At some point
in the human life cycle,|278412004|224130005|44180009
cells|4421005
that
are
located
in the base
of the hair's follicles|67290009
slow,|419443000
and
eventually
stop|422117008
producing colour/pigment|263714004|65863008
(
the term
for this
is
apoptosis.[11]|20663007

The Journal
of Investigative Dermatology_|394582007
published
a study|110465008|224699009
in 2005
which
found|404684003
that Caucasian people|413773004|125676002|185984009|125676002
will
begin|255395001
to gray|229029004|371253002
in their twenties
and
early thirties|264499004
while
Asian people|414978006|125676002
begin|255395001
graying|371253002
in their late thirties,|260383002
but
most African people|413464008|125676002
can
retain|397909002
their original hair color|19535007|80040005
until their mid-forties.|255562008

People|125676002
with albinism|15890002
may
have
white hair|297993006
due to low amounts|62482003|107651007|371880002|107651007
of melanin.|59094002

Children|410601007|160499008
born|106970005|81827009|398209006
with some hair colors|80040005
may
find
it gradually
darkens
as
they
grow.

Many blond,|260396001
strawberry blond,|102261002
light brown,|56242006|371254008|371268001|371254008
or
red haired infants|297997007|418119000
experience
this.

This
is
caused|23981006|134198009
by genes|67271001
being
turned|282987006
off
and
on
during early childhood|264499004|68433009
and
puberty.[13]|18991001

Changes|243326001|263703002
in hair|386045008|119326000
color|263714004
typically
occur|272120004
naturally
as people age,|125676002|424144002
eventually
turning|282987006
the hair gray|297994000
and
then white.|413773004|185984009|371251000

This
is
called achromotrichia.|72280009

Achromotrichia normally|72280009
begins|255395001
in the early|264499004
to mid-twenties|255562008
in men|339947000
and
late twenties|260383002
in women.|224526002

More
than 60 percent|118582008
of Americans
have
some gray hair|297994000
by age 40,|424144002|259031006
but
white hair|297993006
can
appear
as early|264499004
as childhood_[citation|68433009
needed|410525008|103325001
_].

The age|424144002
at which graying|371253002
begins|255395001
seems
almost entirely
due to genetics.

Sometimes people|125676002
are
born|106970005|81827009|398209006
with gray hair|297994000
because
they
inherit|255404009
the trait.

The order
in which graying happens|371253002
is
usually
:
nose hair,|260540009|386045008|260540009|119326000|181195007|386045008|181195007|119326000
hair|386045008|119326000
on the head,|69536005|302548004
beard,|367576007|76207006|256924005
body hair,|279495008|386045008|279495008|119326000|123037004|386045008|123037004|119326000
eyebrows.[14]|392262008

Two genes|420797005|67271001
appear
to
be
responsible|394851003
for the process|415178003
of graying,|371253002
_Bcl2_
and
_Bcl-w_[15]
The change|243326001|263703002
in hair color|80040005
occurs|272120004
when
melanin ceases to|59094002
be
produced
in the hair root|386045008|85077000|386045008|2338009|119326000|85077000|119326000|2338009
and
new hairs|7147002|386045008
grow
in
without pigment.|65863008

The stem cells|419758009
at the base
of hair follicles|67290009
produce
melanocytes,|9683001
the cells|4421005
that
produce
and
store pigment|440276004|65863008
in hair|386045008|119326000
and
skin.|119325001|39937001|181469002

The death|419620001|268923008
of the melanocyte stem cells|9683001|419758009
causes|134198009
the onset|77374008
of graying.|371253002

It
remains
unclear
why
the stem cells|419758009
of one hair follicle|421379005|67290009|421379005|280830006
may
die|419620001|399069006|419099009
well|20572008
over a decade
before those in adjacent follicles less|52101004|18769003|24162005|52101004|18769003|67290009|18720000|18769003|24162005|18720000|18769003|67290009
than a millimeter apart.|258673006

The anti-cancer drug Imatinib|372688009|414460008
has
recently|6493001
been
shown
to
reverse
the graying process.|371253002|415178003

However,
it
is
much too expensive|242762006|4757001
with potentially severe|24484000
and
deadly side effects to
be
used|394850002
to
alter
a person's hair color.|125676002|80040005

Nevertheless,
if
the mechanism|257544000
of action|129264002
of Imatinib|414460008
on melanocyte stem cells|9683001|419758009
can
be
discovered
,
it
is
possible|371930009|60022001
that
a safer
and
less expensive substitute drug|276139006|410942007|263796003|410942007
might
someday
be
developed.[17]

Albinism|15890002
is
a genetic abnormality|3950001|276654001|255395001|276654001
in which little|281411007|255507004
or
no pigment|65863008
is
found|404684003
in human hair,|278412004|386045008|278412004|119326000
eyes|81745001
or
skin.|119325001|39937001|181469002

The hair|386045008|119326000
is
often white|70232002|413773004|70232002|185984009|70232002|371251000
or
pale blond.|398979000|301888000|274643008|371262000

However,
it
can
be
red, darker blond,|386713009|255419005|371240000|255419005
light brown,|56242006|371254008|371268001|371254008
or
rarely,|103356009
even dark brown.|255419005|371254008

Vitiligo|56727007
is
a patchy loss|10027005
of hair|386045008|119326000
and
skin color|276323006|364533002
that
may
occur|272120004
as the result|394617004
of an auto-immune disease.|41266007

Malnutrition|248325000
is
also
known|36692007
to
cause|23981006|134198009
hair to|386045008|119326000
become
lighter,|75926004
thinner,|228993002
and
more brittle.|242762006|255299009

Dark hair|255419005|386045008|255419005|119326000
may
turn|282987006
reddish
or
blondish
due to the decreased production|1250004|260400001|260371004
of melanin.|59094002

The condition|260905004
is
reversible|35174006
with proper nutrition.|87276001|384759009

Werner syndrome|51626007
and
pernicious anemia|84027009
can
also
cause|23981006|134198009
premature graying.|387833009

A 2005 uncontrolled study|19032002|110465008|19032002|224699009
demonstrated
that people 50?70 years|125676002|258707000
of age|424144002
with dark eyebrows|255419005|392262008
but
gray hair|297994000
are
significantly more likely to|2931005
have
type II diabetes|44054006
than those
with
both
gray eyebrows|229029004|392262008|371253002|392262008
and
hair.[18]|386045008|119326000

A 1996 British Medical Journal study|74188005|110465008|74188005|224699009
found|404684003
that tobacco smoking|365981007
may
cause|23981006|134198009
premature graying.|387833009

Smokers|77176002
were
found|404684003
to
be
four|421534005
times more likely to|242762006|2931005
begin|255395001
graying prematurely,|371253002
compared
to nonsmokers.[19]|8392000

Gray hair|297994000
may
temporarily
darken
after inflammatory processes,|415178003
after
electron-beam-induced alopecia,|73494004|16404004|278040002
and
after some chemotherapy regimens.|367336001

Much
remains
to
be
learned|69998004
about the physiology|1360005
of human graying.[20]|278412004|371253002

There
are
no special diets,|67995009|41829006
nutritional supplements,|373453009
vitamins,|87708000
nor
proteins|88878007
that
have
been
proven|277025001
to slow, stop,|419443000|422117008
or
in any way
affect|4065008
the graying process,|371253002|415178003
although
many
have
been
marketed|284440009
over the years.|258707000

However,
French scientists|19434008|308027003
treating|28995006
leukemia patients|87163000|116154003
with a new cancer drug|7147002|372688009
noted
an unexpected side effect
:
some
of the patients' hair color|116154003|80040005
was
restored
to their pre-gray color.[21]|236874000|371253002|272113006|371253002

The hair color|80040005
of mummies
or
buried bodies|279495008|123037004
can
change.|243326001|263703002

Hair|386045008|119326000
contains|42504009
a mixture|272163001
of black-brown-yellow eumelanin|315240009|371254008|263935005|413464008|371254008|263935005|15086000|371254008|263935005|371252007|371254008|263935005
and
red pheomelanin.|386713009|371240000

Eumelanin
is
less chemically stable|276139006|441900009|58158008|263796003|441900009|58158008
than pheomelanin
and
breaks
down faster|16985007|277748003
when
oxidized.

It
is
for this reason|410666004
that Egyptian mummies|297308004|1919006
have
reddish hair.|386045008|119326000

The color|263714004
of hair|386045008|119326000
changes|243326001|263703002
faster|16985007|277748003
under extreme conditions.|12565001|260905004

It
changes|243326001|263703002
more slowly|242762006|419443000
under dry oxidizing conditions|13880007|260905004
(
such as
in burials|52373005
in sand|128489003

than
under wet reducing conditions|17461003|260400001|260905004
(
such as burials|52373005
in wood|14402002

Permanent color,|6934004|263714004
as
the name
suggests
,
permanently
colors|263714004
the hair - however|386045008|119326000
because
hair|386045008|119326000
is
constantly
growing
,
the color|263714004
will
eventually grow out
as new, uncolored hair|7147002|386045008|7147002|119326000
grows
in.

Permanent hair color|6934004|80040005
gives|419582001
the most flexibility|4757001
because
it
can
make
hair lighter|386045008|75926004|119326000|75926004
or
darker|255419005
as well as
changing tone|243326001|223628004|243326001|258691001|263703002|223628004|263703002|258691001
and
color,|263714004
but
there
are
negatives.|260385009

Constant
(monthly|89185003
or
six-weekly|422218008|14497002
)
maintenance
is
essential to|34325006
match|33336008
new hair|7147002|386045008|7147002|119326000
growing
in
to the rest|258157001
of the hair,|386045008|119326000
and
remedy fading.

A one-|421379005
color|263714004
permanent dye|6934004|61789006
creates
a flat, uniform color|6041008|27617004|263714004|257564005|27617004|263714004
across the whole head,|260232004|69536005|260232004|302548004
which
can
look|386548000
unnatural|103359002
and
harsh,|76412005
especially
in a fair shade.

To
combat
this,
the modern trend|30294006
is
to
use|277889008|419385000
multiple colors - usually one color|260396001|263714004|421379005
as a base
with added highlights
or
lowlights
in other shades.|74964007

Semi-permanent color washes out|6934004|263714004
over a period|259037005
of time ? typically four|410669006|421534005
to six weeks,|422218008|258705008
so
root regrowth|85077000|2338009
is
less noticeable.|276139006|263796003

The final color|42796001|263714004
of each strand
is
affected|247591002|248448006
by its original color|19535007|263714004
and
porosity,
so
there
will
be
subtle variations|40885006
in color|263714004
across the head - more natural|69536005|510009|302548004|510009
and
less harsh|276139006|76412005|263796003|76412005
than a permanent dye.|6934004|61789006

However,
this means|255586005
that gray|229029004|371253002
and
white hair|297993006
will
not dye|61789006
to the same color|262126009|263714004
as the rest|258157001
of the head|69536005|302548004
(
in fact,
some white hair|297993006
will
not
absorb
the color|263714004
at all
).

A few gray|57176003|229029004|57176003|371253002
and
white hairs|297993006
will
blend
in sufficiently
not to
be
noticeable,
but
as
they
become
more widespread, there|242762006|85333001
will
come
a point
where a semi-permanent alone|6934004|105529008
will
not
be
enough.

The move|302000008|384598002|370125004
to 100% permanent color|6934004|263714004
can
be
delayed
by
using|260676000
a semi-permanent|6934004
as a base color,|263714004
with permanent highlights.|6934004

Semi-permanent hair color|6934004|80040005
cannot
lighten|80228000
hair.|386045008|119326000

Hair|386045008|119326000
can
only
be
lightened|80228000
using|260676000
chemical lighteners,|441900009
such as bleach.|76885009

Bleaching|76885009
is
always permanent|6934004
because
it
removes|127485006
the natural pigment.|510009|65863008

"Rinses"
are
a form|246176004
of temporary hair color,|14803004|80040005
usually
applied|410618006
to hair|386045008|119326000
during a shampoo|255698008
and
washed out again|60119000
the next time|18769003|410669006|255260001|410669006
the hair|386045008|119326000
is
washed.
