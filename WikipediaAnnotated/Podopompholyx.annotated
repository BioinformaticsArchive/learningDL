(also
known|36692007
as "acute vesiculobullous hand eczema,|402232000
"[1] "cheiropompholyx,|260305007|402567004|260305007|402222007

"[2]|260306008
and
"podopompholyx"[2]|201201000
)
is
a skin condition|422000003
that
is
characterized
by small blisters|255507004|408764000|255507004|247464001
on the hands|85562004
or
feet.|56459004|259051005

It
is
an acute, chronic,|255212004
or
recurrent dermatosis|255227004|95320005
of the fingers,|7569003|259052003
palms,|107631008
and
soles,|57999000
characterized
by a sudden onset|385315009|255363002
of many deep-seated pruritic, clear vesicles|131197000|33586001|263707001|82515000|131197000|360297006|263707001|82515000
;
later,
scaling|271767006
,
fissures|134292000
and
lichenification|402237006
occur.|272120004

Recurrence|246455001
is
common|72906007
and
for many|260396001
can
be
chronic.|90734009

Incidence/prevalence
is
said to|66049007
be
1/5,|264623001
000
in the United States.|223688001

However,
many cases|398241000|413769002
of eczema|281104002
are
diagnosed|439401001
as garden-variety atopic eczema|200775004
without further investigation,|46053002|386053000
so
it
is
possible|371930009|60022001
that
this figure
is
misleading.

This condition|260905004
is
not contagious
to others,|74964007
but
its unsightly nature|277302009
can
lend
to
awkward|7006003
social interaction.|225598002

The compromised integument|48075008|39937001
can
increase|260366006
susceptibility|76522002|118588007
to infection,
and
the accompanying itching|424492005
can
be
a source|260753009
of psychological duress.|60224009

The name
comes
from the word "dyshidrotic," meaning "bad sweating,|255373000|402567004|556001|161857006
"
which
was
once
believed
to
be
the cause,|134198009
but
this association|263534001|272151006
is
unproven|277026000
;
there
are
many cases|260396001|398241000|260396001|413769002
present|52101004|246105001
that
have
no history|392521001
of excessive sweating.|52613005

There
are
many different factors|260396001|263735002
that
may
trigger|410658008
the outbreak|443684005
of dyshidrosis|402567004
such as allergens,|90260006
stress,|262188008
or
seasonal changes.|21864008|243326001|21864008|263703002

Emotional stress|442347009
may
also further|46053002
aggravate|162473008
the condition.|260905004

Small blisters|255507004|408764000|255507004|247464001

:

of dyshidrotic eczema|402567004

Causes|134198009
of dyshidrosis|402567004
are
unknown.|261665006

However,
a number|410680006|410681005
of triggers
to the condition|260905004
exist
:

Allergy testing
is
a contested subject
among eczema communities.|281104002|133928008

Some dermatologists|18803008
posit
that,
if
a sufferer
is
allergic
to a substance,|105590001
then
a general allergy test|60132005
on the forearm|14975008
will
suffice.

However,
others|74964007
believe
that,
with conditions|260905004
like dyshidrosis,|402567004
the suspect substances|415684004|105590001
must
be
applied|410618006
to the affected area to|247591002|42798000|248448006|42798000
induce|16404004
a reaction.|263851003

It
is
often|70232002
seen
in people|125676002
already susceptible|131196009
to allergies|421961002
and/or
asthma.|195967001

There
are
many treatments|260396001|276239002
available|103328004
for dyshidrosis.|402567004

However,
few
of them
have
been
developed
or
tested specifically|272393004
on the condition.|260905004
