is
a closed sac,|29179001
having
a distinct membrane|83097008
and
division|118630004
compared
to the nearby tissue.|85756007

It
may
contain|42504009
air,|417696007
fluids,|32457005|33463005
or
semi-solid material.|35702001|260769002|78910004|260769002|421378002|260769002

A collection
of pus|11311000|119323008
is
called
an abscess,|128477000
not
a cyst.|441457006|103552005

Once
formed|35810008
,
a cyst|441457006|103552005
could
go
away
on its own
or
may
have
to
be
removed|127485006
through surgery.|83578000

Despite
being
described
in 1938
as the microscopic appearance|84496004|386548000|84496004|255412001
of cysts|441457006
in the pancreas,|15776009|181277001
[5] cystic fibrosis|264706000|190905008|264605009|190905008
is
an example
of a genetic disorder|32895009
whose
name|27468005
is
related|272151006|262094002
to fibrosis|263756000
of the cystic duct|77452001|245398005
and
does
not
involve|248448006
actual cysts.[6]|441457006

Most cysts|441457006
in the body|279495008|123037004
are
benign|30807003
(dysfunctional|386585008
)
tumors,|108369006
the result|394617004
of plugged ducts|303480007|343011009
or
other natural body outlets|74964007|510009|279495008|74964007|510009|123037004
for secretions.|46242002

However sometimes
these masses|300848003|118538004
are
considered
neoplasm|108369006
:

Treatment|276239002|416118004
ranges
from simple enucleation|13673007|39250009
of the cyst|441457006|103552005
to curettage|129319001
to resection.|118292001|128303001

There
are
cysts,|441457006
e.g.|258795003

buccal bifurcation cyst|109552000
with self-resolation nature,|277302009
in which
close|29179001
observation only|103705002
can
be
employed|224363007
unless
the cyst|441457006|103552005
is
infected
and
symptomatic.[2]|264931009

A pseudocyst|13467000
is
collection
without a distinct membrane.|83097008

A syrinx|75797008|89734001
in the spinal cord|2748008|180959008
or
brainstem|15926001|180925009
is
sometimes inaccurately
referred|439980006
to
as
a cyst.|441457006|103552005
