The process|415178003
of ovulation|34008004
is
controlled|31509003
by the hypothalamus|67923007|264483005
of the brain|12738006|258335003
and
through the release|58000006|68776005|258760001|129299003|115956009
of hormones|87568004
secreted
in the anterior lobe|255549009
of the pituitary gland,|56329008|181125003
luteinizing hormone (LH)|64182005|69527006
and
follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH).|325781003

In the pre-ovulatory phase|236874000|251664007|21191007|272113006|251664007|21191007
of the menstrual cycle,|78456001
the ovarian follicle|24162005|361111009
will
undergo
a series|13039001
of transformations|61883002
called
cumulus expansion,
which
is
stimulated
by FSH.

After this
is
done
,
a hole
called
the stigma|9097005
will
form|246176004
in the follicle,|24162005|67290009
and
the ovum|263828003
will
leave|7771000|90737002
the follicle|24162005|67290009
through this hole.

Ovulation|34008004
is
triggered|410658008
by a spike
in the amount|107651007
of FSH
and
LH
released|68776005|129299003
from the pituitary gland.|56329008|181125003

During the luteal|19931006
(post-ovulatory|288563008|251664007
)
phase,|21191007
the ovum|263828003
will
travel|420008001
through the fallopian tubes|414982008
toward the uterus.|35039007|181452004

If
fertilized
by a sperm,|6789008
it
may
perform|398166005
implantation there 6?12 days later.|71861002|258703001|25602002|258703001

Ovulation|34008004
occurs|272120004
when
a mature egg|34071009|102263004|34071009|263828003
is
released|68776005|129299003
from the ovary|15497006|83238006|181464007
into the oviduct.|414982008

Afterwards,
it
will
eventually
become
available to|103328004
be
fertilized.

Concomitantly,
the lining|50009006
of the uterus|35039007|181452004
is
thickened to|263899003
be
able to|371150009
receive
a fertilized egg.|57323001

If
no conception|13693004
occurs|272120004
,
the uterine lining|35039007|50009006
as well as
blood|87612001|119273009
will
be
shed
in menstruation.|248957007

In humans,|278412004
the few days|57176003|258703001
near ovulation|34008004
constitute
the fertile phase.|397594008|21191007

The time|410669006
from the beginning|255395001
of the last menstrual period|21840007
(LMP|21840007
)
until
ovulation|34008004
is
,
on average,
14.6[2] days,|258703001
but
with substantial variation|40885006
both
between women|224526002
and
between cycles|44180009
in any single woman,|125681006|224526002|50607009|224526002
with an overall 95% prediction interval|385673002
of 8.2
to 20.5[2] days.|258703001

Cycle length|44180009|410668003
alone|105529008
is
not
a reliable indicator
of the day|258703001|259032004
of ovulation.|34008004

While
in general|60132005
an earlier ovulation|264499004|34008004
will
result|394617004
in a shorter menstrual cycle,|289892008
and
vice versa,
the luteal|19931006
(post-ovulatory|288563008|251664007
)
phase|21191007
of the menstrual cycle|78456001
may
vary
by
up to a week|258705008|259038000
between women._[citation|224526002
needed|410525008|103325001
_]

Strictly
defined
,
the ovulatory phase|251664007|21191007
spans
the period|259037005
of hormonal elevation|278994005|103720008|278994005|255456001
in the menstrual cycle.|78456001

The process|415178003
requires
a maximum|398303009
of thirty-six hours to|422218008|258702006
complete|255594003
,
and
it
is
arbitrarily
separated|13184001|263869007
into three phases|421291004|272108007
:
preovulatory,
ovulatory,|251664007
and
postovulatory.

Through a process|415178003
that
takes|419652001
approximately 375 days,|26175008|258703001
or
thirteen menstrual cycles,|78456001
a large group|255509001|261586004|255509001|160481000|255509001|389109008
of undeveloped _primordial follicles_ dormant|24162005|67290009
in the ovary|15497006|83238006|181464007
is
grown
and
progressively
weaned|37328000
into one _preovulatory follicle._ Histologically,|421379005|24162005|67151002|421379005|67290009|67151002
the preovulatory follicle|24162005|67290009
(also
called
a mature Graafian follicle|64104009
or
mature tertiary follicle|64104009|84965000
contains|42504009
an oocyte|86082002
arrested|397829000|6155003
in metaphase meiosis II|74399001|53992005
surrounded|355648006
by a layer
of corona radiata granulosa cells,|81654009|4421005
a layer
of mural granulosa cells,|261136004|4421005
a protective basal lamina,
and
a network
of blood-carrying capillary vessels|59820001|288345009|20982000|59820001|288345009|255416003|20982000|288345009|59820001|31675002|288345009|59820001
sandwiched
between a layer
of theca interna|24941008
and
theca externa cells.|15205006|4421005

A large sac|255509001
of fluid|32457005|33463005|255765007
called
the antrum
predominates|83296008
in the follicle.|24162005|67290009

A "bridge"|277035007
of cumulus oophorus granulosa cells|18984004|4421005|258586009|4421005
(
or
simply cumulus cells|4421005
)
connects
the corona-ovum complex|81654009|263828003|103360007
to the mural granulosa cells.|261136004|4421005

The granulosa cells engage|4421005|54986009
in bidirectional messaging
with the cells|4421005
and
the oocyte to|86082002
facilitate
follicular function.|255285005|246464006

By the action|129264002
of luteinizing hormone (LH),|64182005|69527006
the preovulatory follicle's theca cells|24162005|4421005|67290009|4421005
secrete
androstenedione|56146000|82681007
that
is
aromatized
by mural granulosa cells|261136004|4421005
into estradiol,|126172005
a type|261664005
of estrogen.|61946003

In contrast
to the other phases|74964007|272108007
of the menstrual cycle,|78456001
estrogen release|61946003|58000006|61946003|68776005|61946003|258760001|61946003|129299003|61946003|115956009
in late follicular phase|260383002|255285005|21191007
has
a stimulatory effect|36645008|253861007
on hypothalamus gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH)|67923007|397197007|264483005|397197007
that in turn|282987006
stimulates
the expression|10012005
of pituitary LH|56329008|58805000
and
follicle stimulating hormone|325781003
(FSH
).

The building concentrations|82742001
of LH
and
FSH
marks|46998006
the beginning|255395001
of the preovulatory phase.|21191007

For ovulation to|34008004
be
successful,|385669000
the ovum|263828003
must
be
supported|9096001|243114000
by both
the corona radiata|81654009
and
cumulus oophorous granulosa cells.|4421005

The latter
undergo
a period|259037005
of proliferation|30217000
and
mucification
known|36692007
as cumulus expansion.

Mucification
is
the secretion|46242002
of a hyaluronic acid-rich cocktail|38218009|224166006
that disperses|86902002
and
gathers
the cumulus cell network|4421005|362837007
in a sticky matrix
around the ovum.|263828003

This network stays
with the ovum|263828003
after ovulation|34008004
and
has
been
shown
to
be
necessary
for fertilization.|55767001

An increase|260366006
in cumulus cell number|118218001
causes|134198009
a concomitant increase|79970003|260366006
in antrum fluid volume|260971007
that
can
swell|423666004|442672001
the follicle|24162005|67290009
to over 20 mm|21481007
in diameter.|81827009

It
forms|246176004
a pronounced bulge|442672001
at the surface|410678000
of the ovary|15497006|83238006|181464007
called
the blister.|408764000|247464001|417237009

Through a signal transduction cascade|38952000
initiated
by LH,
proteolytic enzymes|130202003
are
secreted
by the follicle|24162005|67290009
that
degrade
the follicular tissue|255285005|85756007
at the site|10546003
of the blister,|408764000|247464001|417237009
forming|35810008
a hole
called
the _stigma_.|9097005

The cumulus-oocyte complex|86082002|103360007
(COC
)
leaves|90737002
the ruptured follicle|415747007|24162005|415747007|67290009|263862003|24162005|263862003|67290009
and
moves|302000008
out
into the peritoneal cavity|181616008|83670000
through the stigma,|9097005
where
it
is
caught|30623001|282673009
by the fimbriae|42529003
at the end|261782000|422117008
of the fallopian tube|414982008|181463001
(also
called
the oviduct|414982008
).

After
entering|417985001
the oviduct,|414982008
the ovum-cumulus complex|263828003|103360007
is
pushed|303365000|420620005
along
by cilia,|69315009|85803001
beginning|255395001
its journey
toward the uterus.|35039007|181452004

By this time,|410669006
the oocyte|86082002
has
completed meiosis I,|255594003|53992005|42146005|255594003|53992005|22971001
yielding
two cells|420797005|4421005
:
the larger secondary oocyte|255509001|46886002|263768009|46886002
that
contains|42504009
all
of the cytoplasmic material|260769002
and
a smaller, inactive first polar body.|263796003|73425007|17863007|255507004|73425007|17863007

Meiosis II|53992005
follows|367409002
at
once
but
will
be
arrested|397829000|6155003
in the metaphase|74399001
and
will
so|223528007
remain
until fertilization.|55767001

The spindle apparatus
of the second meiotic division|81170007|372822009|118630004|257997001|372822009|118630004|288495006|372822009|118630004
appears
at the time|410669006
of ovulation.|34008004

If
no fertilization|55767001
occurs|272120004
,
the oocyte|86082002
will
degenerate|33359002
approximately twenty-four hours|26175008|421534005|258702006
after ovulation.|34008004

The mucous membrane|313268005
of the uterus,|35039007|181452004
termed
the _functionalis_,
has
reached|282679008
its maximum size,|398303009|277049003
and
so|223528007
have
the endometrial glands,|43501006
although
they
are
still non-secretory.|46242002

The follicle|24162005|67290009
proper
has
met|229057006
the end|261782000|422117008
of its lifespan.

Without the ovum,|263828003
the follicle|24162005|67290009
folds|26310004
inward|255460003
on itself,
transforming
into the corpus luteum|19931006
(pl.

corpora lutea|19931006
)
,
a steroidogenic cluster
of cells|4421005
that
produces
estrogen|61946003
and
progesterone.|16683002

These hormones|87568004
induce|16404004
the endometrial glands to|43501006
begin|255395001
production
of the proliferative endometrium|46371004
and
later|260383002
into secretory endometrium,|37266000
the site|10546003
of embryonic growth|57991002
if
fertilization|55767001
occurs.|272120004

The action|129264002
of progesterone|16683002
increases|260366006
basal body temperature|300076005
by one-quarter|421379005
to one-half degree Celsius|421379005|258710007
(one-half|421379005
to one degree Fahrenheit|421379005|258712004
).

The corpus luteum|19931006
continues|255238004
this paracrine action|129264002
for the remainder
of the menstrual cycle,|78456001
maintaining|385630006
the endometrium,|2739003|278867007
before
disintegrating
into scar tissue|70582006|275322007
during menses.|248957007|282027006

Ovulation|34008004
is
the release|58000006|68776005|258760001|129299003|115956009
of a single, mature egg|125681006|34071009|102263004|125681006|34071009|263828003|50607009|34071009|102263004|50607009|34071009|263828003
from a follicle|24162005|67290009
that
developed
in the ovary.|15497006|83238006|181464007

It usually
occurs|272120004
regularly,
around day 14|258703001|259032004
of a 28-day menstrual cycle.|258703001|78456001|259032004|78456001

Once
released|68776005|129299003
,
the egg|102263004|263828003
is
capable
of
being
fertilized
for 12
to 48 hours|255249005
before
it
begins|255395001
to
disintegrate.

It
is
the few days|57176003|258703001
around ovulation|34008004
that
a woman|224526002
is
most fertile.|4757001|397594008

The start|255395001
of ovulation|34008004
can
be
detected|260373001
by various signs.|256220008|72670004

Because
the signs|72670004
are
not readily discernible|7882003
by people|125676002
other than the woman|224526002
herself,
humans|278412004
are
said|66049007
to
have
a concealed ovulation.|263721004|34008004

In many animal species there|387961004|69658003
are
distinctive signals
indicating|410535002
the period|259037005
when
the female|248152002|224526002
is
fertile.|397594008

Several explanations|261028005
have
been
proposed
to
explain
concealed|263721004
ovulation|34008004
in humans.|278412004

Women|224526002
near ovulation experience changes|34008004|243326001|34008004|263703002
in the cervix,|71252005
in mucus|49909006
produced
by the cervix,|71252005
and
in their basal body temperature.|300076005

Furthermore,
many women also|224526002
experience
secondary fertility signs|2603003|397594008|72670004|2603003|8619003|72670004|2603003|87727006|72670004|81170007|397594008|72670004|81170007|8619003|72670004|81170007|87727006|72670004
including|55919000
Mittelschmerz|43548008
(pain|22253000
associated|47429007
with ovulation|34008004
)
and
a heightened sense|260365005|106148006|260366006|106148006
of smell.[4]|397686008

Many women|260396001|224526002
experience
heightened sexual desire|260365005|248095000|260365005|248093007|260366006|248095000|260366006|248093007
in the several days immediately|261028005|258703001|49499008
before
ovulation.|34008004

One study|421379005|110465008|421379005|224699009
concluded
that women subtly|224526002
improve|385425000|3442003|385633008
their facial attractiveness|89545001
during ovulation.[6]|34008004

Symptoms
related|272151006|262094002
to the onset|77374008
of ovulation,|34008004
the moment
of ovulation|34008004
and
the body's process|279495008|415178003|123037004|415178003
of beginning|255395001
and
ending|261782000|422117008
the menstrual cycle|78456001
vary
in intensity|103370009
with each individual woman|125676002|224526002|385435006|224526002
but
are
fundamentally
the same.|262126009

The charting
of such symptoms,
primarily Basal Body Temperature,|300076005
Mittelschmerz|43548008
and
cervical position|261064006|246449006
is
referred to|439980006
as
the Sympto-Thermal method|260686004|272394005
of Fertility Awareness,|397594008|312012004|8619003|312012004|87727006|312012004
which
serves
to
allow
auto diagnosis|439401001
by a woman|224526002
of her state|398070004
of ovulation.|34008004

Once training|118629009
has
been
given|419582001
by a suitable authority,
fertility charts|397594008|8619003|87727006
can
be
completed|255594003
on a cycle|44180009
by cycle basis to|44180009|44180009|418836005
chart
ovulation|34008004
giving|419582001
the possibility
of
using|260676000
the data to
predict
fertility|397594008|8619003|87727006
for
both
natural contraception|225371000
and
pregnancy planning.|289908002|312011006|289908002|397943006

The moment
of ovulation|34008004

Research
spearheaded
by Baerwald _
et
al._
suggests
that
the menstrual cycle|78456001
may
not
regulate
follicular growth|255285005
as
strictly
as
previously
thought.|88952004

In particular,
the majority
of women|224526002
during an average twenty-eight day cycle experience two|421825006|258703001|44180009|420797005|421825006|259032004|44180009|420797005
or
three "|421291004
waves
"
of follicular development,|255285005|278923009
with only|50607009|420295001
the final wave|42796001
being
ovulatory.|251664007

The remainder
of the waves
are
anovulatory,|251663001
characterized
by the developed preovulatory follicle falling|24162005|1912002|67290009|1912002
into atresia|56457002
(
a major anovulatory cycle|255603008|251663001
)
or
no preovulatory follicle|24162005|67290009
being
chosen
at all
(
a minor anovulatory cycle|410599005|251663001|255606000|251663001
).

The phenomenon
is
similar
to the follicular waves|255285005
seen
in cows|34618005
and
horses.|35354009

In these animals,|387961004
a large cohort|255509001
of early tertiary follicles|264499004|84965000|24162005|264499004|84965000|67290009
develop
consistently
during the follicular phase|255285005|21191007
of the menstrual cycle,|78456001
suggesting
that
the endocrine system|113331007|278876000
does
not
regulate
folliculogenesis stringently.

Researchers
of fertility awareness|397594008|312012004|8619003|312012004|87727006|312012004

discovered
follicular waves|255285005
in the 1950s._[citation
needed|410525008|103325001

These methods|260686004|272394005
of family planning|310031001|397619005
have
always
taken|419652001
multiple follicular waves|260396001|255285005
into account,
and
this research
does
not challenge
their effectiveness.|255403003

The gene Lrh1|67271001
appears
to
be
essential|34325006
in
regulating
ovulation.[11]|34008004

Disorders|64572001
of ovulation|34008004
are
classified|73504009
as menstrual disorders,|289896006
and
include|55919000
oligoovulation|426272003
and
anovulation|34571000
:

The World Health Organization (WHO)|263775005|21139007
has
developed
the following classification|255260001|73504009
of ovulatory disorders|251664007|64572001
:
[12]

Ovulation induction|61285001
is
a promising assisted reproductive technology|371152001
for patients|116154003
with conditions|260905004
such as polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS)|69878008
and
oligomenorrhea.|52073004

It
is
also
used|394850002
in
in vitro fertilization to|55767001
make
the follicles|24162005|67290009
mature|34071009
prior to egg retrieval.|102263004|263828003

Usually,
ovarian stimulation|15497006|122545008|83238006|122545008|181464007|122545008
is
used|394850002
in conjunction with _ovulation induction_ to|61285001
stimulate
the formation|11798007|255277001
of multiple oocytes.|260396001|86082002

Some sources[14]|260753009
include|55919000
_ovulation induction_|61285001
in the definition
of _ovarian stimulation_.|15497006|122545008|83238006|122545008|181464007|122545008

A low dose|262459003
of human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG)|408755005|59433001|426919007
may
be
injected|422145002
after completed ovarian stimulation.|255594003|15497006|122545008|255594003|83238006|122545008|255594003|181464007|122545008

Ovulation|34008004
will
occur|272120004
between 24?36 hours|123027009|259029002
after the HCG injection.[14]|28289002|385218009|129326001

Contraception|13197004
can
be
achieved
by suppressing|245780008
the ovulation.|34008004

The majority
of hormonal contraceptives|278994005|417122000
and
conception|13693004
boosters
focus|87017008|363702006
on the ovulatory phase|251664007|21191007
of the menstrual cycle|78456001
because
it
is
the most important determinant|4757001
of fertility.|397594008|8619003|87727006

Hormone therapy|169413002
can
positively
or
negatively
interfere|78235001
with ovulation|34008004
and
can
give|419582001
a sense|106148006
of cycle control|44180009|31509003
to the woman.|224526002

Estradiol|126172005
and
progesterone,|16683002
taken|419652001
in various forms|256220008|246176004
including|55919000
combined oral contraceptive pills,|346388008|46992007
mimics
the hormonal levels|278994005|258395000
of the menstrual cycle|78456001
and
engage|54986009
in negative feedback|260385009
of folliculogenesis
and
ovulation.|34008004
