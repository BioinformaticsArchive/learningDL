is
the condition|260905004
in which
an organism|410653004
is
born|106970005|81827009|398209006
with secondary sex characteristics[1]|2603003|258139002|2603003|365952006|2603003|263495000|2603003|70256003|2603003|57312000|81170007|258139002|81170007|365952006|81170007|263495000|81170007|70256003|81170007|57312000
or
a phenotype[2]|8116006|363778006
that
is
different|263735002
from what
would
be
expected
on the basis|418836005
of the gonadal tissue|43174007|85756007
(ovary|15497006|83238006|181464007
or
testis.|279572002|181431007

In some cases,|398241000|413769002
the external sex organs|261074009|258139002|410653004|261074009|365952006|410653004|261074009|263495000|410653004|261074009|70256003|410653004|261074009|57312000|410653004
look|386548000
intermediate|11896004
between the typical clitoris|65439009|181442003
or
penis.|18911002|265793009

In other cases,|74964007|398241000|74964007|413769002
the external sex organs|261074009|258139002|410653004|261074009|365952006|410653004|261074009|263495000|410653004|261074009|70256003|410653004|261074009|57312000|410653004
have
an appearance|386548000|255412001
that
does
not
look|386548000
intermediate,|11896004
but
rather
has
the appearance|386548000|255412001
that
would
be
expected
to
be
seen
with the "opposite" gonadal tissue.|43174007|85756007

Because of this,
pseudohermaphroditism|75164001
is
sometimes
not
identified|7882003
until puberty.|18991001

It
is
possible|371930009|60022001
for the condition to|260905004
be
undetected
until adulthood.[3]|41847000

The term "male pseudohermaphrodite"|248153007
is
used|394850002
when
a testis|279572002|181431007
is
present,|52101004|246105001
and
the term "female pseudohermaphrodite"|248152002|224526002
is
used|394850002
when
an ovary|15497006|83238006|181464007
is
present.|52101004|246105001

The term "true" hermaphrodite|18978002
is
reserved
for the very rare cases|260358002|84638005|398241000|260358002|84638005|413769002|260358002|103356009|398241000|260358002|103356009|413769002
where
both
ovarian|15497006|83238006|181464007
and
testicular tissue|85756007
is
present.|52101004|246105001

(
Whether
or
not
that term
would
be
appropriate
when
ovotestes|18978002
are
found|404684003
,
or
only
when
distinct ovaries|15497006|83238006
and
testes|36528006|279572002
are
found|404684003
,
is
not well defined.|260409000
)

Associated conditions|47429007|260905004
in males|248153007
include|55919000
5-?-reductase deficiency[5]|264689000|124236005
from a deficiency|260372006|248325000
in the male chromosome|248153007|91272006
(46 XY.[6][7]

Surgery|83578000
has
sometimes
been
performed|398166005
to
alter
the appearance|386548000|255412001
of the genitals.[8][9]

Use|277889008|419385000
of the term "pseudohermaphroditism"|75164001
can
be
problematic,
and
is
now considered redundant.|160901009

The term "pseudohermaphroditism"|75164001
was
created
by Edwin Klebs
in 1876,
[11][12] long|255511005
before the genetic roles|3950001|255395001
of the X chromosome|72837006
and
Y chromosome|5421003
and
the social components|246093002
of gender identity|263495000|247889000
were
well characterized,|20572008
which
is
why
the term
is
usually
used|394850002
to
describe
the dissonance
between gonadal histology|43174007|67151002|43174007
and
external genital appearance.|261074009|263767004|386548000|261074009|263767004|255412001

The term "intersexuality"|237821001|15867007
was
introduced|127487003
by Richard Goldschmidt
in 1923.

However,
the term "intersex"
has
also
been
challenged
;
the Lawson Wilkins Pediatric Endocrine Society|394537008|113331007
and
the European Society|414152003
for Pediatric Endocrinology|419610006
have
adopted|160496001
a nomenclature system|246333005
based|418836005
on disorders|64572001
of sex development,|112092002
which
covers|255334000
"congenital conditions|6160004|260905004|255399007|260905004
in which development|278923009
of chromosomal, gonadal,|91272006|43174007
or
anatomical sex|36298004|258139002|36298004|365952006|36298004|263495000|36298004|70256003|36298004|57312000
is
atypical"|112231000
and
thus
replaces|282089006|370124000
many disparate terms,
including|55919000
but
not
limited|255469002
to those
based|418836005
on "hermaphrodite."[10][14]|237821001

One example|421379005
of the challenges
involved|248448006
in the use|277889008|419385000
of the term
is
the case of women with Complete Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome (CAIS).|398241000|224526002|52832001

These women often|224526002|70232002
have
primary|63161005|261424001
and
secondary sexual characteristics|2603003|365952006|81170007|365952006
typical
of other women|74964007|224526002
;
however,
they
are
genetically XY
and
have
internal testes,|260521003|36528006|260521003|279572002
rather than
ovaries.|15497006|83238006

They
have
the same likelihood|262126009|2931005
of a genetically XX woman|264680001|224526002
of enjoying sexual pleasure|112080002|365952006
but
are
unable to biologically|371151008|12893009
reproduce.

Their sexuality|365952006|118200004
(homosexual,|38628009
heterosexual,|20430005
bisexual etc.|42035005
)
is
unrelated|262241003
to this syndrome.

However scientifically precise
the description "male" _pseudohermaphrodite_|248153007
may
be
for such women,|224526002
it
is
clearly socially inappropriate.

CAIS
is
considered
little better|3442003
by some,
as
the _S_|288495006
for _syndrome_
in CAIS
does
not
accord
with the "normality" many CAIS women|17621005|224526002|258744000|224526002
feel|285854004
about their bodies.|279495008|123037004

In human beings,|278412004
the sex status|258139002|263490005|365952006|263490005|263495000|263490005|70256003|263490005|57312000|263490005
is
defined
at four levels|421534005|258395000
:
chromosomal|91272006
(XY
;
XX,|264680001
internal organs|260521003|410653004
(ovaries|15497006|83238006
; testicles|279572002
)
,
external organs|261074009|410653004
(breasts,|76752008
vulva + vagina|45292006|76784001|45292006|181441005|265796001|76784001|265796001|181441005
; penis|18911002|265793009
)
,
and
psyche
(sexual identity|365952006|247889000
).

In a XX human|264680001|278412004
the default development process|278923009|415178003
results|394617004
in a female.|248152002|224526002

In a XY human|278412004
a set
of genes|67271001
on the Y chromosome|5421003
trigger|410658008
a cascade
of events normally|272379006
resulting|42752001
in a male.|248153007

A complete female|255594003|248152002|255594003|224526002
or
male developmental process|248153007|278923009|415178003
entails
the expression|10012005
of female|248152002|224526002
and
male sex hormones,
respectively,
and
of their corresponding receptors|116647005
in the target tissues.|85756007

Without these hormones|87568004
and
their receptors,|116647005
the internal|260521003
and
external sex organs,|261074009|258139002|410653004|261074009|365952006|410653004|261074009|263495000|410653004|261074009|70256003|410653004|261074009|57312000|410653004
and
psyche,
will
not
develop
as
expected.

Sex hormones,|312263009
their receptors,|116647005
and
downstream signal transduction proteins|103365002|38952000|88878007
are
coded
by genes|67271001
that
may
be
genetically defective.

All
these factors
mean|255586005
that genetic mutations|55446002
can
block|26036001|112232007
the sexual development process|112092002|415178003
at three stages|421291004|261612004
:
(
a
)
before the development|278923009
of the internal sex organs|260521003|258139002|410653004|260521003|365952006|410653004|260521003|263495000|410653004|260521003|70256003|410653004|260521003|57312000|410653004
;
(b
)
after the development|278923009
of the internal sex organs|260521003|258139002|410653004|260521003|365952006|410653004|260521003|263495000|410653004|260521003|70256003|410653004|260521003|57312000|410653004
but
before the development|278923009
of external sex organs|261074009|258139002|410653004|261074009|365952006|410653004|261074009|263495000|410653004|261074009|70256003|410653004|261074009|57312000|410653004
;
and
(c
)
after the development|278923009
of external sex organs|261074009|258139002|410653004|261074009|365952006|410653004|261074009|263495000|410653004|261074009|70256003|410653004|261074009|57312000|410653004
but
before the maturation
of the sexual component|365952006|246093002
of the psyche.

While
in
(
a
)
the XY human|278412004
will
be
indistinguishable anatomically
and
psychologically
from a female|248152002|224526002
;
in
(b
)
the individual|125676002|385435006
may
either
be
born|106970005|81827009|398209006
with ambiguous external genitals|261074009
or
have
genitals apparently
in the normal range|260395002
at birth|3950001
but
,
at pubertal age,|419960003|424144002
not
develop
secondary sexual characteristics|2603003|365952006|81170007|365952006
at all
or
develop
secondary sexual characteristics|2603003|365952006|81170007|365952006
that
do
not
match|33336008
the external genitals|261074009
;
and
in
(c
)
the individual|125676002|385435006
will
be
transgendered|407374003
(formerly
referred|439980006
to
as
transsexual|407374003
).

There
are
other intersexual states|74964007|15867007
that
are
not
the result|394617004
of the genetic configurations|3950001|103377007|255395001|103377007
above.|261183002

In particular,
where
either
the individual|125676002|385435006
is
a chimera -|2229005
resulting|42752001
from a fusion|31883006|122501008
of two distinct embryos,|420797005|57991002
one male|421379005|248153007
and
one female,|421379005|248152002|421379005|224526002
during fetal development|278923009
(
not
a genetic mosaic|17523003
)
,
or
the individual|125676002|385435006
contains|42504009
duplicated chromosomes|89049001|91272006
in the genome|18470003
(XXY
; XXXY
).

In the former case|9130008|398241000
some tissues|85756007
will
be
in the XX|264680001
and
others|74964007
in the XY configuration|103377007
;
in the latter,
all cells|4421005
contain|42504009
the Y chromosome|5421003
and
may
or
may
not
use|277889008|419385000
it.

This
is
a gynandromorph,
which
has
both
female|248152002|224526002
and
male characteristics|248153007
at all four levels|421534005|258395000
and
may
have
either
ambiguous sex organs|258139002|410653004|365952006|410653004|263495000|410653004|70256003|410653004|57312000|410653004
(
the XY/XX configuration|264680001|103377007
may
not
be
evenly
distributed
throughout the body|279495008|123037004
)
or
unambiguous male|248153007
and
female sex organs|248152002|410653004
(hermaphrodite|237821001
).

John Money
is
perhaps
the best-known early researcher|20572008|36692007|264499004|3442003|36692007|264499004
in this area.|42798000

His doctoral thesis|309343006
was
titled
_Hermaphroditism|237821001
:
An Inquiry
into the Nature|277302009
of a Human Paradox_,|278412004|27699000
and
awarded
by Harvard University|224871002
in 1952.[15]

Money's general views|60132005|246516004
on gender identity|263495000|247889000
as
something
learned|69998004
during childhood|68433009
were
later directly
contradicted
by a biography
published
in 2001
by one|421379005
of his former patients,|9130008|116154003
David Reimer.

Among the repercussions
was
damage|37782003
to John Money's reputation.

Not only
had
his theory
of gender plasticity|263495000|417641001
been
dealt
a severe blow|24484000|387085005|24484000
but
Reimer's biography
described
bizarrely unpleasant childhood therapy sessions,|68433009|276239002
and
implied
that Money
had
ignored
or
concealed|263721004
the developing evidence|18669006
that Reimer's reassignment
to female|248152002|224526002
was
not
going
well.|20572008

Money's defenders
have
suggested
that
some
of the allegations
about the therapy sessions|276239002
may
have
been
the result|394617004
of False memory syndrome.|283997008

However,
Reimer's
brother|70924004
and
mother|72705000
both
agreed
that
the therapy|276239002
was
not "working"|261041009
in the sense|106148006
that Reimer
wasn't
in any way
developing
a female self-image|248152002|225510008|224526002|225510008
during his treatment|276239002|416118004
with Dr.|309343006

Money.

Dr.|309343006

Money never publicly
stated|398070004
that
his conclusions
were
incorrect.

Milton Diamond|1726000
has
probably
become
the best known expert|20572008|36692007|3442003|36692007
public
advocate
for the intersex community|133928008
in the early 21st century.|264499004

He
is
