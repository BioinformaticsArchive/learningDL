In medicine,|410942007
*
*amyloidosis|17602002
*
* refers|439980006
to a variety
of conditions|260905004
wherein
amyloid proteins|259778002
are
abnormally
deposited|46595003
in organs|410653004
or
tissues|85756007
and
cause harm.|134198009

A protein|88878007
is
described
as
being
amyloid|184196007
if,
due to an alteration
in its secondary structure,|2603003|81170007
it
takes|419652001
on a particular aggregated insoluble form,|47286004|246176004
similar
to the beta-pleated sheet.|52095000|10942006|255292000|260989008|10942006|255292000

Symptoms
vary
widely
depending
upon where
in the body amyloid deposits|279495008|184196007|46595003|123037004|184196007|46595003
accumulate.

Amyloidosis|17602002
may
be
inherited|255404009
or
acquired.[2]|255396000

The modern classification|73504009
of amyloid disease|17602002
tends
to
use|277889008|419385000
an abbreviation|398223008
of the protein|88878007
that
makes
the majority
of deposits,|46595003
prefixed
with the letter A.|126202002

For example,
amyloidosis|17602002
caused|23981006|134198009
by transthyretin|37959007
is
termed "ATTR".|37959007

Deposition patterns|46595003|272135003
vary
between patients|116154003
but
are
almost always
composed
of just one amyloidogenic protein.|421379005|259778002

Deposition|46595003
can
be
systemic|31099001
(
affecting|247591002|248448006
many different organ systems|263735002|91689009
)
or
organ-specific.|410653004|69658003

Many amyloidoses|260396001|17602002
are
inherited|255404009
,
due to mutations|55446002
in the precursor protein.|88878007

Other forms|74964007|246176004
are
due to different diseases|263735002|64572001
causing|23981006
overabundant
or
abnormal protein production -|111995000
such as
with overproduction
of immunoglobulin light chains|87316007
in multiple myeloma|55921005
(termed AL amyloidosis,|23132008
or
with continuous overproduction|255238004
of acute phase proteins|91309004
in chronic inflammation|84499006
(
which
can
lead|88488004
to AA amyloidosis.|281034005

Out of the approximately 60 amyloid proteins|26175008|259778002
that
have
been
identified|7882003
so far,|223528007|46053002
[3]|260313008
at least 36|276139006|263796003
have
been
associated|47429007
in some way
with a human disease.[4]|278412004|64572001

When
a native cell|263818007|4421005|263818007|362837007
creates
a protein,|88878007
it
could
either
make
the actual protein|88878007
or
protein fragments.|88878007|29140007

These fragments|29140007
could
come
and
join together to
form|246176004
the actual protein.|88878007

Such
a protein|88878007
can
sometimes
regress
into the protein fragments.|88878007|29140007

This process|415178003
of "flip flopping" happens frequently|70232002
in certain proteins,|17162000|88878007
especially
the ones|421379005
that
cause|23981006|134198009
this disease.|64572001

The fragments|29140007
or
actual proteins|88878007
are
at risk|410519009
of
mis-folding|10942006
as
they
are
synthesized
,
to
make
a bad protein.|556001|88878007

This causes proteolysis,|134198009
which
is
the directed degradation|40091007
of proteins|88878007
by cellular enzymes|4421005|90668006
called
proteases|130202003|116536008
or
by intramolecular digestion|106079008
;
proteases|130202003|116536008
come
and
digest
the
mis-folded|26310004
fragments|29140007
and
proteins.|88878007

The problem|55607006
occurs|272120004
when
the proteins|88878007
do
not
dissolve|421682005
in proteolysis.

This happens
because
the
mis-folded|26310004
proteins sometimes|88878007
become
robust enough
that
they
are
not
dissolved|421682005
by normal proteolysis.|17621005|258744000

When
the fragments|29140007
do
not
dissolve|421682005
,
they
get
spit|12405001
out of proteolysis
and
they
aggregate|18403000
to
form|246176004
oligomers.

The reason|410666004
they
aggregate|18403000
is
that
the parts|260726005
of the protein|88878007
that
do
not
dissolve|421682005
in proteolysis
are
the ?-pleated sheets,|10942006|255292000
which
are
extremely hydrophobic.

They
are
usually
sequestered
in the middle|255562008|399488007
of the protein,|88878007
while
parts|260726005
of the protein|88878007
that
are
more soluble|242762006
are
found|404684003
near the outside.|261074009

When
they
are
exposed|24932003
to water,|11713004|119318008
these hydrophobic pieces
tend
to
aggregate|18403000
with other hydrophobic pieces.|74964007

This ball
of fragments gets|29140007
stabilized|409051000
by GAG's|5512001
(glycosaminoglycans|82565009
)
and
SAP
(serum amyloid P|259780008
)
,
a component|246093002
found|404684003
in amyloid aggregations|184196007|47286004|184196007|258746003
that
is
thought to|88952004
stabilize|409051000
them
and
prevent
proteolytic cleavage|23365005
).

The stabilized balls|409051000
of protein fragments|88878007|29140007
are
called
oligomers.

The oligomers
can
aggregate|18403000
together
and
further|46053002
stabilize|409051000
to
make
amyloid fibrils.|184196007|88921000

Both
the oligomers
and
amyloid fibrils|184196007|88921000
can
cause|23981006|134198009
cell toxicity|4421005|362837007
and
organ dysfunction.[5]|410653004|386585008

The names
of the amyloid usually|184196007
start|255395001
with the letter "|126202002
A".

Following|255260001
is
a brief description|359530003|359535008
of the more common types|242762006|72906007|261664005
of amyloid|184196007
:

As of 2010,
there
were
27 human|278412004
and
nine animal fibril proteins|422113007|272169002|88921000
classified|73504009
,
along
with eight inclusion bodies.[7]|421825006|279495008|421825006|123037004

There
are
numerous symptoms|260396001
that
are
associated|47429007
with this disease.|64572001

The most common ones|4757001|72906007|421379005
have
to do
with the heart,|80891009|302509004
such as heart failure|84114007|42343007
and
arrhythmia.

Also,
the respiratory tract|20139000|321667001|361110005
can
be
affected|247591002|248448006
and
cause hemoptysis.|134198009|66857006

Usually,
the spleen enlarges|78961009|260376009|78961009|118452000|181279003|260376009|181279003|118452000
and
sometimes ruptures.|415747007

The gastrointestinal tract|122865005|279972009
is
usually
affected|247591002|248448006
and
causes|134198009
vomiting,|249497008
hemorrhaging|131148009
and
diarrhea.|398032003

Amyloidosis|17602002
can
also
affect|4065008
the body's motor functions|279495008|52479005|123037004|52479005
and
cause polyneuropathy.|134198009|42345000

When
the amyloid fibrils|184196007|88921000
and
oligomers
get
to the skin,|119325001|39937001|181469002
they
can
cause|23981006|134198009
skin lesions|95324001
and
petechiae.|423716004

One|421379005
of the most well known symptoms|4757001|20572008|36692007
is
macroglossia.[5]|270516002|25273001

If diagnosis|439401001
of amyloidosis|17602002
is
suspected,|415684004
a tissue sample|119376003
of abdominal wall fat,|83908009|271590003|181613000|271590003
the rectum|34402009|181261002
or
a salivary gland,|75535001|181236000
can
be
examined|64049009
in biopsy|86273004
for evidence|18669006
of characteristic amyloid deposits.|184196007|46595003

The tissue|85756007
is
treated|28995006
with various stains.|256220008|397165007|256220008|127790008

The most useful stain|4757001|397165007|4757001|127790008
in the diagnosis|439401001
of amyloid|184196007
is
Congo red,|45106005
which,
combined|89780004
with polarized light,|56242006|371268001
makes
the amyloid proteins|259778002
appear
apple-green|46051000|371246006|67505008|371246006|229775001|371246006|256311001|371246006
on microscopy.|117259009

Alternatively,
thioflavin T stain|61068006|406939004
may
be
used.|394850002

An abdominal wall fat biopsy|83908009|271590003|86273004|181613000|271590003|86273004
is
not completely sensitive|83185005
and
,
sometimes,
biopsy|86273004
of an involved organ|248448006|410653004
(
such as the kidney|64033007|17373004|181414000
)
is
required to
achieve
a diagnosis.[8]|439401001

The nature|277302009
of the amyloid protein|259778002
can
be
determined
by various ways|256220008
:
the detection
of abnormal proteins|111995000
in the bloodstream
(
on protein electrophoresis|82962001
or
light chain determination|56242006|46666003|371268001|46666003
)
,
binding|257768005
of particular antibodies|68498002
to the amyloid|184196007
found|404684003
in the tissue,|85756007
or
extraction|62972009
of the protein|88878007
and
identification|286672002|7882003
of its individual amino acids.[8]|125676002|52518006|385435006|52518006

An older, clinical, method|70753007|58147004|260686004|70753007|58147004|272394005
of classification refers|73504009|439980006

as
*
*systemic|31099001
*
*
or

or
