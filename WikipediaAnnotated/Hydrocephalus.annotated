/?ha?dr??s?f?l?s/,|309343006
also
known|36692007
as "water|11713004|119318008
in the brain,|12738006|258335003
"
is
a medical condition|74188005|260905004
in which there
is
an abnormal accumulation|263654008
of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)|65216001
in the ventricles,|35764002|21814001
or
cavities,|80967001|91806002|2483006
of the brain.|12738006|258335003

This
may
cause|23981006|134198009
increased intracranial pressure|271719001
inside the skull|89546000
and
progressive enlargement|255314001|56246009|255314001|118452000|255314001|442021009
of the head,|69536005|302548004
convulsion,|91175000
tunnel vision,|420990001
and
mental disability.|419284004|47437004

Hydrocephalus|230745008
can
also
cause|23981006|134198009
death.|419620001|268923008

The name
derives
from the Greek words ????-|1451003|255373000
(hydro-
)
"water",|11713004|119318008
and ???????
(kephalos
)
"head".|69536005|302548004

The clinical presentation|58147004|246105001
of hydrocephalus|230745008
varies
with chronicity.|246452003

Acute dilatation|5314004
of the ventricular system|21814001|246333005
is
more likely to|242762006|2931005
manifest|250255003
with the nonspecific signs|10003008|72670004
and
symptoms
of increased intracranial pressure.|271719001

By contrast chronic dilatation|125268006
(especially
in the elderly population|105436006|385436007|105436006|389109008
)
may
have
a more insidious onset presenting,|242762006|367326009|246105001
for instance,
with Hakim's triad
(Adams triad
).

Symptoms
of increased intracranial pressure|271719001
may
include|55919000
headaches,|25064002
vomiting|249497008
,
nausea,|422587007
papilledema,|423341008
sleepiness|271782001
or
coma.|371632003|405809000

Elevated intracranial pressure|271719001
may
result|394617004
in uncal
and/or
cerebellar tonsill herniation,|413807008
with resulting life threatening brain stem compression.|42752001|224130005|5582005

Hakim's triad
of gait instability,|22631008
urinary incontinence|165232002
and
dementia|12348006|52448006
is
a relatively typical manifestation|250255003|251190009
of the distinct entity normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH).|30753002

Focal neurological deficits|87017008|264552009
may
also
occur|272120004
,
such as abducens nerve palsy|398963001
and
vertical gaze palsy|246773002
(Parinaud syndrome|37991008
due to compression|71173004|263720003
of the quadrigeminal plate,|44718000
where
the neural centers|3057000|26216008|256864008|26216008
coordinating|162258009
the conjugated vertical eye movement|103395005|33096000|103395005|33096000|373642008
are
located
).

The symptoms
depend
on the cause|134198009
of the blockage,
the person's age,|125676002|424144002
and
how
much brain tissue|256865009|280369009
has
been
damaged|37782003
by the swelling.|423666004|442672001

In infants|418119000
with hydrocephalus,|230745008
CSF builds
up
in the central nervous system,|21483005|278199004
causing|23981006
the fontanelle|79361005|272681004
(soft spot|37378003|23840004
)
to
bulge|442672001
and
the head to|69536005|302548004
be
larger|255509001|263768009
than
expected.

Early symptoms|264499004
may
also
include|55919000
:

Symptoms
that
may
occur|272120004
in older children|31114009

References
to hydrocephalic skulls|89546000
can
be
found|404684003
in ancient Egyptian medical literature|297308004|74188005|1919006|74188005
from 2500 BC
to 500 AD.

Hydrocephalus|230745008
was
described
more clearly|242762006
by the ancient Greek physician Hippocrates|1451003|309343006
in the 4th century BC,|29970001
while
a more accurate description|242762006|263656005
was
later
given|419582001
by the Roman physician Galen|223655008|309343006|34385009
in the 2nd century AD.|81170007

The first clinical description|255216001|58147004|232714002|58147004
of an operative procedure|83578000|129284003
for hydrocephalus|230745008
appears
in the _Al-Tasrif_
(1000 AD
)
by the Arab surgeon,|90027003|304292004
Abulcasis,
who clearly
described
the evacuation|122461007
of superficial intracranial fluid|26283006|303231004|32457005|26283006|303231004|33463005|26283006|303231004|255765007|26283006|303231004
in hydrocephalic children.|410601007|160499008

He
described
it
in his chapter
on neurosurgical disease,|64572001
describing
infantile hydrocephalus|3658006|230745008|263784005|230745008
as
being
caused|23981006|134198009
by mechanical compression.|285403007

He
states|398070004
:
[2]|260306008

In 1881,
a few years|57176003|258707000
after the landmark study|110465008|224699009
of Retzius
and
Key,
Carl Wernicke|21007002
pioneered
sterile ventricular puncture|261029002|21814001|11639007|261029002|21814001|85921004|15296000|21814001|11639007|15296000|21814001|85921004
and
external CSF drainage|257811002
for the treatment|276239002|416118004
of hydrocephalus.|230745008

It
remained
an intractable condition|20646008|260905004
until the 20th century,
when
shunts|442119001|257351008|125319009
and
other neurosurgical treatment modalities|74964007|276239002|74964007|416118004
were
developed.

It
is
a lesser-known medical condition|263796003|36692007|74188005|260905004
;
relatively small amounts|255507004|107651007
of research
are
conducted|844005
to
improve|385425000|3442003|385633008
treatments|276239002
for hydrocephalus,|230745008
and
to this day there|258703001|259032004
remains
no cure
for the condition.|260905004

In developing countries,|223369002
it
is
common|72906007
that
this condition|260905004
go
untreated|25265005
at birth.|3950001

It
is
difficult to|52925006
diagnose|439401001
during ante-natal care|272113006|223731005
and
access|260507000
medical treatment|74188005|276239002|74188005|416118004
is
limited.|255469002

However,
when
head swelling|445385004
is
prominent, children|4657009|410601007|4657009|160499008
are
taken|419652001
at great expense|255509001|263768009
for treatment.|276239002|416118004

By then brain tissue|256865009|280369009
is
undeveloped
and
neurosurgery|394610002|16545005
is
rare|84638005|103356009
and
difficult.|52925006

Children more commonly|410601007|160499008
live|419749002
with undeveloped brain tissue|256865009|280369009
and
consequential mental retardation.|103332005|91138005

Hydrocephalus|230745008
is
usually
due to blockage
of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) outflow|65216001
in the ventricles|35764002|21814001
or
in the subarachnoid space|35951006
over the brain.|12738006|258335003

In a person|125676002
without hydrocephalus,|230745008
CSF continuously
circulates|65929005
through the brain,|12738006|258335003
its ventricles|35764002|21814001
and
the spinal cord|2748008|180959008
and
is
continuously
drained|32712000
away
into the circulatory system.|113257007

Alternatively,
the condition|260905004
may
result|394617004
from an overproduction
of the CSF,
from a congenital malformation|276654001
blocking|2899008|112232007
normal drainage|17621005|307488001|17621005|122462000|258744000|307488001|258744000|122462000
of the fluid,|32457005|33463005|255765007
or
from complications|116223007
of head injuries|82271004
or
infections.[4]

Compression of the brain|46963008
by the accumulating fluid eventually|32457005|33463005|255765007
may
cause|23981006|134198009
neurological symptoms|267070008
such as convulsions,
mental retardation|91138005
and
epileptic seizures.|313307000

These signs|72670004
occur|272120004
sooner
in adults,|133936004
whose skulls|89546000
are
no longer able to|255511005|371150009
expand|70955005
to
accommodate
the increasing fluid volume|260369004|260971007
within.

Fetuses,
infants,|418119000
and
young children|84422007|410601007|84422007|160499008
with hydrocephalus typically|230745008
have
an abnormally large head,|12138000
excluding|77765009
the face,|89545001|302549007
because
the pressure|279046003|13543005|257893003
of the fluid|32457005|33463005|255765007
causes|134198009
the individual skull bones ?|90780006|89546000|125676002|89546000|385435006|89546000
which
have
yet to
fuse ? to
bulge|442672001
outward|255543005
at their juncture points.|39352004

Another medical sign,|74188005|72670004
in infants,|418119000
is
a characteristic fixed downward gaze|102491009|255521002|261010008|255521002
with whites|413773004|185984009
of the eyes|81745001
showing
above the iris,|41296002|27527003|181164000
as though
the infant|418119000
were
trying
to
examine|64049009
its own lower eyelids.[5]|62736007

The elevated intracranial pressure|271719001
may
cause|23981006|134198009
compression of the brain,|46963008
leading|236874000
to brain damage|2470005
and
other complications.|116223007

Conditions|260905004
among affected individuals|247591002|125676002|247591002|385435006|248448006|125676002|248448006|385435006
vary
widely.

If
the foramina
(_pl._
)
of the fourth ventricle|35918002|180932000
or
the cerebral aqueduct|80447000|279249003
are
blocked|26036001|112232007
,
cereobrospinal fluid (CSF)|32457005|33463005|255765007
can
accumulate
within the ventricles.|35764002|21814001

This condition|260905004
is
called
*
*internal hydrocephalus|128431009
*
*
and
it
results|394617004
in increased CSF pressure.|51590001

The production
of CSF
continues|255238004
,
even
when
the passages|255592004
that normally
allow
it to
exit|5173006
the brain|12738006|258335003
are
blocked.|26036001|112232007

Consequently,
fluid builds|32457005|33463005|255765007
inside the brain causing|12738006|23981006|258335003|23981006
pressure|279046003|13543005|257893003
that
dilates|255381004
the ventricles|35764002|21814001
and
compresses|37204000
the nervous tissue.|91728009|110657001

Compression|71173004|263720003
of the nervous tissue usually|91728009|110657001
results|394617004
in irreversible brain damage.|2470005

If
the skull bones|89546000
are
not completely
ossified
when
the hydrocephalus|230745008
occurs|272120004
,
the pressure|279046003|13543005|257893003
may
also severely|24484000
enlarge|260376009|118452000
the head.|69536005|302548004

The cerebral aqueduct|80447000|279249003
may
be
blocked|26036001|112232007
at the time|410669006
of birth|3950001
or
may
become
blocked later in life|26036001|260383002|224130005|112232007|260383002|224130005
because of a tumor|108369006
growing
in the brainstem.|15926001|180925009

Internal hydrocephalus|128431009
can
be
successfully
treated|28995006
by placing|257557008
a drainage tube|257287003
(shunt|442119001|257351008|125319009
)
between the brain ventricles|35764002
and
abdominal cavity to|52731004|361294009
eliminate
the high intracranial pressure.|75540009|250844005|371879000|250844005

There
is
some risk|30207005
of infection
being
introduced|127487003
into the brain|12738006|258335003
through these shunts,|442119001|257351008|125319009
however,
and
the shunts|442119001|257351008|125319009
must
be
replaced|282089006|370124000
as the person grows.|125676002

A subarachnoid hemorrhage|21454007
may
block|26036001|112232007
the return|7528007
of CSF
to the circulation.|413854007

This
should
be
distinguished
from
*
*external hydrocephalus|253132009
*
*.

This
is
a condition generally|260905004
seen
in infants|418119000
and
involving|248448006
enlarged fluid spaces|260376009|32457005|260376009|33463005|260376009|255765007|260376009|118452000|32457005|118452000|33463005|118452000|255765007|118452000
or
subarachnoid spaces|35951006
around the outside of the brain.|261074009|12738006|261074009|258335003

This
is
generally
a benign condition|30807003|260905004
that
resolves
spontaneously
by 2 years|260306008|258707000
of age.|424144002

and
a good medical history|20572008|392521001
can
help
to
differentiate|263933003
external hydrocephalus|253132009
from subdural hemorrhages|95453001
or

are
accompanied
by vomiting,|249497008

Hydrocephalus|230745008
can
be
caused|23981006|134198009
by impaired cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) flow,|260379002|65216001|40226000|65216001
reabsorption,
or
excessive CSF production.|423666004|21639008

Based|418836005
on its underlying mechanisms,|257544000
hydrocephalus|230745008
can
be
classified|73504009
into
*
*communicating|43272002|288577006
*
*
and
*
*non-communicating|30016003
*
*
(obstructive|263821009
).

Both
forms|246176004
can
be
either

*
or

*
*,
also
known|36692007
as

*non-obstructive hydrocephalus|192805000
*
*,
is
caused|23981006|134198009
by impaired cerebrospinal fluid resorption|260379002|65216001|40226000|65216001
in the absence|2667000|418560003

between the ventricles|35764002|21814001
and
subarachnoid space.|35951006

It
has
been
theorized
that
this
is
due to functional impairment|40143009|40226000|246464006|40226000
of the arachnoidal granulations|20682003
(also
called
arachnoid granulations|20682003
or
*
*Pacchioni's granulations
*
*
)
,
which
are
located
along the superior sagittal sinus|24773008
and
is
the site|10546003
of cerebrospinal fluid resorption|65216001
back
into the venous system.|119553000

Various neurologic conditions|256220008|1199008|260905004
may
result|394617004
in communicating hydrocephalus,|271569006
including|55919000
subarachnoid/intraventricular hemorrhage,|21454007|23276006
meningitis|7180009
and
congenital absence|24216005
of arachnoid villi.|20682003

Scarring|275322007
and
fibrosis|263756000
of the subarachnoid space|35951006
following|255260001
infectious, inflammatory,
or
hemorrhagic events|255345002|272379006
can
also
prevent
resorption
of CSF,
causing|23981006
diffuse ventricular dilatation.|19648000|6210001

Non-communicating hydrocephalus,|82346000
or
*
*obstructive hydrocephalus|230746009
*
*,
is
caused|23981006|134198009
by a CSF-flow obstruction ultimately|26036001
preventing|116699007
CSF
from flowing
into the subarachnoid space|35951006
(
either
due to external compression|261074009|71173004|261074009|263720003
or
intraventricular mass lesions|300848003|118538004
).

The cranial bones|181792001
fuse
by the end|261782000|422117008
of the third year|70905002|258707000|70905002|259039008
of life.|224130005

For head enlargement to|12138000
occur|272120004
,
hydrocephalus|230745008
must
occur|272120004
before then.|236874000|421718005

The causes|134198009
are
usually genetic|3950001|255395001
but
can
also
be
acquired|255396000
and
usually
occur|272120004
within the first few months|255216001|258706009|232714002|258706009
of life,|224130005

and

)
Dandy-Walker malformation.|14447001

In newborns|133933007
and
toddlers
with hydrocephalus,|230745008
the head circumference|363812007
is
enlarged rapidly|260376009|418694008|118452000|418694008
and
soon
surpasses
the 97th percentile.|118583003

Since
the skull bones|89546000
have
not yet firmly
joined
together,
bulging|442672001|112639008
,
firm anterior|20583004|255549009
and
posterior fontanelles|15994005
may
be
present|52101004|246105001
even
when
the patient|116154003
is
in an upright position.|246449006

The infant|418119000
exhibits
fretfulness,
poor feeding,|299698007
and
frequent vomiting.|70232002|249497008

As the hydrocephalus progresses,|230745008|385651009
torpor sets|214264003
in,
and
the infant|418119000
shows
lack|41277001
of interest|225469004
in his surroundings.|355648006

Later|260383002
on,
the upper eyelids|38934000|244499008
become
retracted|37794007
and
the eyes|81745001
are
turned|282987006
downwards|255518004
(
due to hydrocephalic pressure|279046003|13543005|257893003
on the mesencephalic tegmentum|50972004
and
paralysis|44695005
of upward gaze|255533007
).

Movements|255324009
become
weak|13791008|260407003
and
the arms|40983000
may
become
tremulous.|267079009

Papilledema|423341008
is
absent|2667000
but
there
may
be
reduction|58294000|260400001|289928003
of vision.|281004000

The head|69536005|302548004
becomes
so|223528007
enlarged|260376009|118452000
that
the child|410601007|160499008
may
eventually
be
bedridden.|160685001

About 80-90%|264705001|264703008
of fetuses
or
newborn infants|133933007
with spina bifida?often|67531005|70232002
associated|47429007
with meningocele|171131006|172069000
or
myelomeningocele?|203994003
develop
hydrocephalus.[8]|230745008

This condition|260905004
is
acquired|255396000
as a consequence|103332005
of CNS infections,|128117002
meningitis,|7180009
brain tumors,|126952004
head trauma,|82271004
intracranial hemorrhage|1386000
(subarachnoid
or
intraparenchymal
)
and
is
usually extremely painful.|22253000

Because
hydrocephalus|230745008
can
injure
the brain,|12738006|258335003
thought|88952004
and
behavior|844005
may
be
adversely
affected.|247591002|248448006

Learning disabilities
including|55919000
short-term memory loss|247592009
are
common|72906007
among those with hydrocephalus,|20401003|230745008|421463005|230745008
who
tend
to
score|278061009
better|3442003
on verbal IQ|255373000
than
on performance IQ,|304669008
which
is
thought to|88952004
reflect|225436004
the distribution|255464007
of nerve damage|57182000
to the brain.|12738006|258335003

However
the severity|272141005
of hydrocephalus|230745008
can
differ
considerably
between individuals|125676002|385435006
and
some
are
of average
or
above-average intelligence.|221668007

Someone
with hydrocephalus|230745008
may
have
motion|56219004
and
visual problems,|255374006|55607006
problems|55607006
with coordination,|85352007
or
may
be
clumsy.

They
may
reach|282679008
puberty|18991001
earlier|264499004
than the average child|410601007|160499008

Hydrocephalus treatment|230745008|276239002|230745008|416118004
is
surgical, generally|83578000
creating
various types|256220008|261664005
of cerebral shunts.|442119001|257351008|125319009

It
involves|248448006
the placement|257867005
of a ventricular catheter|21814001|19923001
(
a tube|83059008
made
of silastic,|256582003
into the cerebral ventricles to|35764002
bypass
the flow obstruction/malfunctioning arachnoidal granulations|26036001|76797004|20682003|26036001|386585008|20682003
and
drain|32712000
the excess fluid|423666004|21639008
into other body cavities,|74964007|91806002
from where
it
can
be
resorbed.

Most
shunts|442119001|257351008|88834003|125319009
drain|32712000
the fluid|32457005|33463005|255765007
into the peritoneal cavity|181616008|83670000
(ventriculo-peritoneal shunt,|47020004
but
alternative sites|10546003
include|55919000
the right atrium|264181001|244383003
(ventriculo-atrial shunt,|59652004|442119001|59652004|257351008|59652004|125319009

A shunt system|442119001|246333005|257351008|246333005|125319009|246333005
can
also
be
placed|257557008|421066005
in the lumbar space|182343007
of the spine|421060004|44300000|243930007
and
have
the CSF
redirected
to the peritoneal cavity|181616008|83670000
(Lumbar-peritoneal shunt.|261126007|442119001|261126007|257351008|261126007|125319009|182343007|303593000

An alternative treatment|276239002|416118004
for obstructive hydrocephalus|230746009
in selected patients|116154003
is
the endoscopic third ventriculostomy (ETV),|441763001
whereby
a surgically|83578000
created
opening|56116003
in the floor
of the third ventricle|49841001|180931007
allows
the CSF
to flow directly
to the basal cisterns,|57195005
thereby shortcutting
any obstruction,|26036001
as
in aqueductal stenosis.|71779008

This
may
or
may
not
be
appropriate
based|418836005
on individual anatomy.|125676002|91723000|385435006|91723000

Examples
of possible complications|371930009|116223007|60022001|116223007
include|55919000
shunt malfunction,|442119001|76797004|442119001|386585008|257351008|76797004|257351008|386585008|125319009|76797004|125319009|386585008
shunt failure,|442119001|76797004|257351008|76797004|125319009|76797004
and
shunt infection,|442119001|257351008|125319009
along
with infection
of the shunt tract|442119001|257351008|125319009
following|255260001
surgery|83578000
(
the most common reason|4757001|72906007|410666004
for shunt failure|442119001|76797004|257351008|76797004|125319009|76797004
is
infection
of the shunt tract|442119001|257351008|125319009
).

Although
a shunt generally|442119001|257351008|125319009
works|261041009
well,|20572008
it
may
stop|422117008
working|261041009
if
it disconnects,
becomes
blocked|26036001|112232007
(clogged
)
,
infected
,
or
it
is
outgrown.

If
this happens
the cerebrospinal fluid|65216001
will
begin|255395001
to
accumulate
again
and
a number|410680006|410681005
of physical symptoms|5880005|19388002
will
develop
(headaches,|25064002
nausea,|422587007
vomiting|249497008
,
photophobia/light sensitivity|409668002|409668002
)
,
some extremely serious,|42745003
like seizures.|91175000

The shunt failure rate|442119001|76797004|257351008|76797004|125319009|76797004
is
also relatively high|75540009|371879000
(
of the 40,000 surgeries|259031006|83578000
performed|398166005
annually to|53281000
treat|395077000
hydrocephalus,|230745008
only 30%|50607009|420295001
are
a patient's first surgery|116154003|255216001|83578000|116154003|232714002|83578000
)
[9]
and
it
is
not uncommon|103356009
for patients to|116154003
have
multiple shunt revisions|260396001|442119001|272129003|260396001|257351008|272129003|260396001|125319009|272129003
within their lifetime.

The diagnosis|439401001
of cerebrospinal fluid buildup|65216001
is
complex|103360007
and
requires
specialist expertise.|309395003

Another complication|116223007|263718001
can
occur|272120004
when
CSF
drains|32712000
more rapidly|242762006|418694008
than it
is
produced
by the choroid plexus,|80621003|264450003
causing|23981006
symptoms -listlessness,|20602000
severe headaches,|24484000|25064002
irritability,|55929007
light sensitivity,|409668002
auditory hyperesthesia|255328007|14151009
(sound sensitivity|35209006|365705006|68325009|35209006|68325009|365705006
)
,
nausea,|422587007
vomiting|249497008
,
dizziness,|404640003|399153001
vertigo,|399153001
migraines,|37796009
seizures,|91175000
a change|243326001|263703002
in personality,|71565002
weakness|13791008|260407003
in the arms|40983000
or
legs,|30021000
strabismus,|22066006
and
double vision - to|24982008
appear
when
the patient|116154003
is
vertical.|33096000

If
the patient|116154003
lies|40199007|255576009
down,
the symptoms usually
vanish
in a short amount|359530003|107651007|367450005|107651007
of time.|410669006

A CT scan|77477000
may
or
may
not
show
any change|243326001|263703002
in ventricle size,|21814001|277049003
particularly
if
the patient|116154003
has
a history|392521001
of slit-like ventricles.|724005|35764002|724005|21814001

Difficulty|371157007
in diagnosing overdrainage|439401001
can
make
treatment|276239002|416118004
of this complication particularly|116223007|263718001
frustrating|224973000
for patients|116154003
and
their families.|35359004

Resistance|30714006
to traditional analgesic pharmacological therapy|263901007|241715001|56183000
may
also
be
a sign|72670004
of shunt overdrainage _|442119001|257351008|125319009
or
_ failure.|76797004

Diagnosis|439401001
of the particular complication usually|116223007|263718001
depends
on
when
the symptoms
appear
-
that
is
,
whether symptoms
occur|272120004
when
the patient|116154003
is
upright
or
in a prone position,|1240000
with the head|69536005|302548004
at roughly
the same level|262126009|258395000|262126009|276625007
as the feet.|56459004|259051005

Since
the cost
of shunt systems|442119001|246333005|257351008|246333005|125319009|246333005
is
beyond the
reach|282679008
of most people|125676002
in developing countries,|223369002
most people|125676002
with hydrocephalus|230745008
die|419620001|399069006|419099009
without even
getting
a shunt.|442119001|257351008|125319009

Worse|230993007|390772001|231877006
is
the rate
of revision|255231005|118635009|261560009
in shunt systems|442119001|246333005|257351008|246333005|125319009|246333005
that
adds
to the cost
of shunting many times.|88834003|410669006|88834003|417929005

to those
of the shunt systems|442119001|246333005|257351008|246333005|125319009|246333005
from developed countries.|223369002

The study|110465008|224699009
was
done
in Uganda|223538002
and
the shunts|442119001|257351008|125319009
were
donated
by the International Federation
for Spina Bifida|67531005
and
Hydrocephalus.|230745008

One interesting case|421379005|225469004|398241000
involving|248448006
a person|125676002
with past hydrocephalus|410513005|230745008
was
a 44-year-old French man,|258707000|70753007|19434008|248153007|258707000|70753007|19434008|339947000|258707000|70753007|19434008|278412004|259039008|70753007|19434008|248153007|259039008|70753007|19434008|339947000|259039008|70753007|19434008|278412004
whose brain|12738006|258335003
had
been
reduced|260400001
to little more|242762006
than a thin sheet|18043004|255292000
of actual brain tissue,|256865009|280369009
due to the buildup
of cerebrospinal fluid|65216001
in his head.|69536005|302548004

The man,|248153007|339947000|278412004
who
had
had
a shunt|442119001|257351008|125319009
inserted|257867005
into his head|69536005|302548004
to drain away fluid|32712000|32457005|32712000|33463005|32712000|255765007|32712000
(
which
was
removed|127485006
when
he
was
14
)
,
went
to a hospital|285201006
after
he
had
been
experiencing
mild weakness|255604002|13791008|255604002|255604002|260407003
in his left leg.|48979004|213384005

In July 2007,
_Fox News_ quoted Dr.|309343006

Lionel Feuillet
of H?pital|89177007|258322007|286551008
de la Timone
in Marseille
as saying
:
"
The images
were
most unusual...|4757001

the brain|12738006|258335003
was
virtually absent."[11]|2667000
When
doctors|309343006
learned|69998004
of the man's medical history,|248153007|392521001|339947000|392521001|278412004|392521001
they
performed|398166005
a computed tomography (CT) scan|77477000|373205008|77477000
and
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan,|113091000
and
were
astonished
to
see|281004000
"massive enlargement"|46998006|56246009|46998006|118452000|46998006|442021009
of the lateral ventricles|66720007
in the skull.|89546000

Intelligence tests|72657008
showed
the man|248153007|339947000|278412004
had
an IQ
of 75,
below the average score|278061009
of 100.

This
would
be
considered
"borderline intellectual functioning"-|413384008
which
is
just next to|18769003
the level|258395000|276625007
of
being
officially
considered
mentally
challenged.

Remarkably,
the man|248153007|339947000|278412004
was
a married father|160787000|66839005|87915002|66839005
of two children,|420797005|410601007|420797005|160499008
and
worked|261041009
as a civil servant,|236297007
leading|236874000
an
at least superficially normal life,|276139006|17621005|224130005|276139006|258744000|224130005|263796003|17621005|224130005|263796003|258744000|224130005
despite
having
enlarged ventricles|260376009|35764002|260376009|21814001|118452000|35764002|118452000|21814001
with a decreased volume|1250004|118565006|1250004|419569009|260400001|118565006|260400001|419569009|260371004|118565006|260371004|419569009
of brain tissue.|256865009|280369009

"
What I|42146005|22971001
find
amazing
to this day|258703001|259032004
is
how
the brain|12738006|258335003
can
deal
with something
which you
think|88952004
should
not
be
compatible|385433004|7883008
with life,|224130005
" commented Dr.|309343006

Max Muenke,
a pediatric brain defect specialist|394537008|12738006|6920004|309395003|394537008|258335003|6920004|309395003
at the National Human Genome Research Institute.|50470001|385437003

"
If
something
happens
very slowly over quite|260358002|419443000|21481007
some time,|410669006
maybe
over decades,
the different parts|263735002|260726005
of the brain take up functions|12738006|419652001|255532002|246464006|12738006|419652001|353734004|246464006|258335003|419652001|255532002|246464006|258335003|419652001|353734004|246464006
that
would
normally
be
done
by the part|260726005
that
is
pushed|303365000|420620005
to the side."[12][13][14]|182353008

September
has
been
designated
as U.S National Hydrocephalus Awareness Month.|223688001|230745008|312012004|258706009|223688001|230745008|312012004|259036001
