,
which
can

together
as

variations|40885006
of a type|261664005
of clefting congenital deformity|276654001

by abnormal facial development|276654001|89545001

A
*
*cleft|9094003
*
*
is
a fissure|134292000
or
opening?|56116003
a gap.

It
is
the non-fusion|31883006|122501008
of the body's natural structures|123037004|510009
that form|246176004
before birth.|3950001

Approximately 1|26175008
in 700 children|410601007|160499008
born|106970005|81827009|398209006
have
a cleft lip|80281008
and/or
a cleft palate.|253986002

In decades past,
the condition|260905004
was
sometimes
referred|439980006
to
as
*
*harelip|80281008
*
*,
based|418836005
on the similarity
to the cleft|9094003
in the lip|261114002|181221003
of a hare,|1464002
but
that term
is
now generally
considered
to
be
offensive.

Clefts|9094003
can
also
affect|4065008
other parts|74964007|260726005
of the face,|89545001|302549007
such as the eyes,|81745001
ears,|117590005|1910005
nose,|260540009|181195007
cheeks,|60819002
and
forehead.|52795006

In 1976,
Paul Tessier
described
fifteen lines|50009006
of cleft.|9094003

Most
of these craniofacial clefts|9094003
are
even more rare|84638005|103356009
and
are
frequently|70232002
described
as Tessier clefts|9094003
using|260676000
the numerical locator|410680006
devised
by Tessier.[1]

A cleft lip|80281008
or
palate|261145003|181227004
can
be
successfully
treated|28995006
with surgery,|83578000
especially so
if
conducted|844005
soon after birth|3950001
or
in early childhood.|264499004|68433009

If
the cleft|9094003
does
not
affect|4065008
the palate structure|261145003
of the mouth|74262004|123851003|21082005|181220002
it
is
referred to|439980006
as
cleft lip.|80281008

Cleft lip|80281008
is
formed|35810008
in the top|421812003
of the lip|261114002|181221003
as
either
a small gap|255507004
or
an indentation|82448003
in the lip|261114002|181221003
(partial|255609007
or
incomplete cleft|255599008|9094003|255609007|9094003
)
or
it
continues|255238004
into the nose|260540009|181195007
(complete cleft|255594003|9094003
).

Lip cleft|80281008
can
occur|272120004
as a one sided|66459002
(unilateral|66459002
)
or
two sided|420797005|182353008
(bilateral|51440002
).

It
is
due to the failure|76797004
of fusion|31883006|122501008
of the maxillary|70925003
and
medial nasal processes|32222005|308877001
(formation|11798007|255277001
of the primary palate|359541001
).

Unilateral incomplete|66459002|255599008|66459002|255609007

Unilateral complete|66459002|255594003

Bilateral complete|51440002|255594003

A mild form|255604002|246176004
of a cleft lip|80281008
is
a
*
*microform cleft|9094003
*
*.

A microform cleft|9094003
can
appear
as small|255507004
as a little dent|281411007|255507004
in the red part|386713009|260726005|371240000|260726005
of the lip|261114002|181221003
or
look|386548000
like a scar|70582006|275322007
from the lip|261114002|181221003
up to the nostril.|1797002

In some cases muscle tissue|398241000|91727004|413769002|91727004
in the lip|261114002|181221003
underneath the scar|70582006|275322007
is
affected|247591002|248448006
and
might
require
reconstructive surgery.|122465003

It
is
advised to|424900004
have
newborn infants|133933007
with a microform cleft|9094003
checked|360160009
with a craniofacial team
as soon
as possible to|371930009|60022001
determine
the severity|272141005
of the cleft.[5]|9094003

almost gone.

*
*Cleft palate|253986002
*
*
is
a condition|260905004
in which
the two plates|420797005|271003
of the skull|89546000
that
form|246176004
the hard palate|90228003|245778002
(roof|224738009
of the mouth|74262004|123851003|21082005|181220002
)
are
not completely
joined.

The soft palate|49460000|245784004
is
in these cases cleft|398241000|9094003|413769002|9094003
as well.|20572008

In most cases,|398241000|413769002
cleft lip|80281008
is
also
present.|52101004|246105001

Cleft palate|253986002
occurs|272120004
in about
one|421379005
in 700 live births worldwide.[6]|281050002

Palate cleft|253986002
can
occur|272120004
as complete|255594003
(soft|37378003
and
hard palate,|90228003|245778002
possibly|60022001
including|55919000
a gap
in the jaw|661005|181811001
)
or
incomplete|255599008|255609007
(

in the roof|224738009
of the mouth,|74262004|123851003|21082005|181220002
usually
as a cleft soft palate|253997002
).

When
cleft palate|253986002
occurs|272120004
,
the uvula|26140008
is
usually
split.

It
occurs|272120004
due to the failure|76797004
of fusion|31883006|122501008
of the lateral palatine processes,|49370004|76947007
the nasal septum,|68426009|181197004
and/or
the median palatine processes|399488007|76947007|260528009|76947007
(formation|11798007|255277001

The hole
in the roof|224738009
of the mouth|74262004|123851003|21082005|181220002
caused|23981006|134198009
by a cleft|9094003

the mouth directly|74262004|123851003|21082005|181220002
to the nasal cavity.|279549004|263481003

A result|394617004
of an open connection|56116003|263538003
between the oral cavity|74262004|181220002
and
nasal cavity|279549004|263481003
is
called velopharyngeal inadequacy (VPI).|278714002

Because of the gap,
air leaks|417696007|87952002
into the nasal cavity|279549004|263481003
resulting|42752001
in a hypernasal voice resonance|229645001|39527002|229645001|33679000|229645001|300594005

Secondary effects|2603003|253861007|81170007|253861007
of VPI|278714002|4775000
include|55919000
speech articulation errors|39352004|53026004
(

compensatory misarticulations|229719002
and
mispronunciations
(

and
posterior nasal fricatives.|12309006

Possible treatment options|371930009|276239002|371930009|416118004|60022001|276239002|60022001|416118004

lengthening|129349004
of the palate,|261145003|181227004
and
surgical procedures.[7]|83578000

Submucous cleft palate (SMCP)|43437003
can
also
occur|272120004
,
which
is
a cleft|9094003
of the soft palate|49460000|245784004
with a classic clinical triad|255301002|58147004|255333006|58147004
of a bifid,|263684000
or
split, uvula|26140008
which
is
found dangling|404684003
in the back of the throat,|255551008|54066008|255551008|49928004|255551008|264231000
a furrow
along the midline|399488007|260528009
of the soft palate,|49460000|245784004
and
a notch
in the back margin|123961009|112233002|123961009|82868003|123961009|372249001|255551008|112233002|255551008|82868003|255551008|372249001|281213008|112233002|281213008|82868003|281213008|372249001|302552004|112233002|302552004|82868003|302552004|372249001|77568009|112233002|77568009|82868003|77568009|372249001
of the hard palate.[9]|90228003|245778002

Most children|410601007|160499008
who
have
their clefts|9094003
repaired|50826004
early|264499004
enough
are
able to|371150009
have
a happy youth|112080002|22396007|112080002
and
social life.|224130005

Having
a cleft palate/lip|253983005
does
not inevitably
lead|88488004
to a psychosocial problem.|55607006

However,
adolescents|133937008
with cleft palate/lip|253983005
are
at an elevated risk|75540009|30207005
for developing psychosocial problems especially|55607006
those relating|272151006|262094002
to self concept,
peer relationships|272151006
and
appearance.|386548000|255412001

Adolescents|133937008
may
face|89545001|302549007
psychosocial challenges
but
can
find
professional
help
if problems|55607006
arise.|68727004

A cleft palate/lip|253983005
may
impact|134293005
an individual?s self-esteem,|125676002|247891008|385435006|247891008
social skills
and
behavior.|844005

There
is
research
dedicated
to the psychosocial development|278923009
of individuals|125676002|385435006
with cleft palate.|253986002

Self-concept
may
be
adversely
affected|247591002|248448006
by the presence|386397008
of a cleft lip|80281008
and or
cleft palate,|253986002
particularly
among girls.[10]|431549007

Research
has
shown
that
during the early preschool years|264499004|161116001|258707000
(ages 3?5|424144002
)
,
children|410601007|160499008
with cleft lip|80281008
and or
cleft palate|253986002
tend
to
have
a self-concept
that
is
similar
to their peers
without a cleft.|9094003

However,
as
they
grow
older|70753007
and
their social interactions|225598002
increase|260366006
,
children|410601007|160499008
with clefts|9094003
tend
to
report|229059009|223458004
more dissatisfaction|242762006
with peer relationships|272151006
and
higher levels|75540009|258395000|371879000|258395000
of social anxiety.|247832004

Experts
conclude
that
this
is
probably
due to the associated stigma|47429007|9097005
of visible deformities|24054004|276654001
and
possible speech impediments.|371930009|60022001

Children|410601007|160499008
who
are
judged|11205001
as attractive
tend
to
be
perceived|81742003
as more intelligent,|242762006|22851009
exhibit
more positive social behaviors,|242762006|258758003|225599005|242762006|10828004|225599005
and
are
treated|28995006
more positively|242762006
than children|410601007|160499008
with cleft lip|80281008
and or
cleft palate.|253986002

Children|410601007|160499008
with clefts|9094003
tend
to
report|229059009|223458004
feelings|285854004
of anger,|75408008
sadness,|366979004
fear,|1402001
and
alienation
from their peers,
but
these children|410601007|160499008
were
similar
to their peers
in regard
to "
how
well|20572008
they
liked
themselves."

The relationship|272151006
between parental attitudes|40683002|225464009
and
a child?s self-concept|410601007|160499008
is
crucial
during the preschool years.|161116001|258707000

It
has
been
reported|229059009|223458004
that elevated stress levels|75540009|405052004
in mothers|72705000
correlated
with reduced social skills|260400001
in their children.|410601007|160499008

Strong parent support networks|260404005|243116003
may
help
to
prevent
the development|278923009
of negative self-concept|260385009
in children|410601007|160499008
with cleft palate.|253986002

In the later preschool|260383002|161116001
and
early elementary years,|264499004|57795002|258707000
the development|278923009
of social skills
is
no longer only|255511005
impacted|134293005
by parental attitudes|40683002|225464009
but
is
beginning|255395001
to
be
shaped|107644003|300842002
by their peers.

A cleft lip|80281008
and or
cleft palate|253986002
may
affect|4065008
the behavior|844005
of preschoolers.|410602000

Experts
suggest
that parents|40683002
discuss
with their children ways|410601007|160499008
to handle negative social situations|260385009
related|272151006|262094002
to their cleft lip|80281008
and or
cleft palate.|253986002

A child|410601007|160499008
who
is
entering|417985001
school|257698009
should
learn|69998004
the proper

to confidently
explain
the condition|260905004
to others|74964007
may
limit|255469002
feelings|285854004
of awkwardness|7006003
and
embarrassment
and
reduce|260400001
negative social experiences.[14]|260385009

As children|410601007|160499008
reach|282679008
adolescence,|22396007
the period|259037005
of time|410669006
between age 13|424144002
and
19,
the dynamics
of the parent-child relationship change|40683002|410601007|272151006|243326001|40683002|410601007|272151006|263703002|40683002|160499008|272151006|243326001|40683002|160499008|272151006|263703002
as peer groups|261586004|160481000
are
now
the focus|87017008|363702006
of attention.|6769007

An adolescent|133937008
with cleft lip|80281008
and or
cleft palate|253986002
will
deal
with the typical challenges
faced|89545001|302549007
by most
of their peers
including|55919000
issues|55607006
related|272151006|262094002
to self esteem,|247891008
dating|410671006
and
social acceptance.

Adolescents,|133937008
however,
view appearance|246516004|386548000|246516004|255412001
as the most important characteristic above intelligence|4757001|22851009
and
humor.|386325009

This
being
the case,|398241000
adolescents|133937008
are
susceptible|131196009
to additional problems|260364009|55607006
because
they
cannot
hide|421332005
their facial differences|89545001|263735002
from their peers.

Adolescent boys typically|133937008|433152004
deal
with issues|55607006
relating|272151006|262094002
to withdrawal,
attention,|6769007
thought|88952004
,
and
internalizing problems|55607006
and
may
possibly|60022001
develop
anxiousness-depression|231504006
and
aggressive behaviors.|61372001

Adolescent girls|133937008|431549007
are
more likely to|242762006|2931005
develop
problems|55607006
relating|272151006|262094002
to self concept
and
appearance.|386548000|255412001

Individuals|125676002|385435006
with cleft lip|80281008
and or
cleft palate often|253986002|70232002
deal
with threats
to their quality|263496004
of life|224130005
for multiple reasons|260396001|410666004
including|55919000
:
unsuccessful social relationships,|385671000|272151006
deviance|263739008|40885006
in social appearance|386548000|255412001
and
multiple surgeries.|260396001|83578000

Cleft|9094003
may
cause|23981006|134198009
problems|55607006
with feeding,|129007004
ear disease,|25906001
speech
and
socialization.

Due to lack|41277001
of suction,|274441001
an infant|418119000
with a cleft|9094003
may
have
trouble feeding.|129007004

An infant|418119000
with a cleft palate|253986002
will
have
greater success feeding|263768009|385669000|129007004
in a more upright position.|242762006|246449006

Gravity|91071007
will
help
prevent
milk|3718001|119321005|70813002
from coming
through the baby's nose|418119000|260540009|418119000|181195007
if
he/
she
has
cleft palate.|253986002

Gravity feeding|91071007|129007004
can
be
accomplished
by
using|260676000
specialized equipment,|67995009|246137000|246137000
such as the Haberman Feeder,
or
by
using|260676000
a combination|89780004
of nipples|24142002
and
bottle inserts|68276009|257867005|68276009|421532009|419672006|257867005|419672006|421532009
like the one|421379005
shown,
is
commonly
used|394850002
with other infants.|74964007|418119000

A large hole,|255509001
crosscut,
or
slit|112693006
in the nipple,|24142002|54468004|265780004
a protruding nipple|112639008|24142002|112639008|54468004|112639008|265780004
and
rhythmically
squeezing|241978003
the bottle insert|68276009|257867005|68276009|421532009|419672006|257867005|419672006|421532009
can
result|394617004
in controllable flow
to the infant|418119000
without the stigma|9097005
caused|23981006|134198009
by specialized equipment.|67995009|246137000|246137000

Individuals|125676002|385435006
with cleft also|9094003
face|89545001|302549007
many middle ear infections|65363002
which
can
eventually
lead|88488004
to total hearing loss.|258755000|258755000|343087000|258755000|15188001|255619001|255619001|343087000|255619001|15188001

The Eustachian tubes|91207004
and
external ear canals|84301002
may
be
angled|1483009
or
tortuous,|15690004
leading|236874000
to food|255620007
or
other contamination|74964007
of a part|260726005
of the body|279495008|123037004
that
is
normally self cleaning.|228402009

Hearing|47078008|118230007
is
related|272151006|262094002
to learning|69998004
to speak.|87335007|286370002

Babies|418119000
with palatal clefts|261145003|9094003
may
have
compromised
hearing|47078008|118230007
and
therefore,
if
the baby|418119000
cannot
hear,|47078008
it
cannot
try
to
mimic
the sounds
of speech.

Thus,
even before expressive language acquisition,|297335008
the baby|418119000
with the cleft palate|253986002
is
at risk|410519009
for receptive language acquisition.|61909002

Because
the lips|261114002
and
palate|261145003|181227004
are
both
used|394850002
in pronunciation,
individuals|125676002|385435006
with cleft usually|9094003
need|410525008|103325001
the aid|246088000
of a speech therapist.|159026005

The development|278923009
of the face|89545001|302549007
is
coordinated|162258009
by complex morphogenetic events|103360007|54125006|272379006
and
rapid proliferative expansion,|255358001|30217000
and
is
thus highly susceptible|75540009|131196009
to environmental|276339004
and
genetic factors,|3950001|255395001
rationalising
the high incidence|75540009|371879000
of facial malformations.|398206004

During the first six|255216001|422218008|232714002|422218008
to eight weeks|421825006|258705008
of pregnancy,|289908002
the shape|107644003|246176004|300842002
of the embryo's head|57991002|69536005|57991002|302548004
is
formed.|35810008

Five primitive tissue lobes|421820001|85756007
grow
:

If
these tissues|85756007
fail
to
meet|229057006
,
a gap
appears
where the tissues|85756007
should
have
joined
(fused
).

This
may
happen
in any single joining site,|125681006|10546003|50607009|10546003
or
simultaneously|79970003
in several|261028005
or
all
of them.

The resulting birth defect|42752001|276654001|42752001|276720006
reflects|225436004
the locations|246267002
and
severity|272141005
of individual fusion failures|125676002|4541003|385435006|4541003
(
e.g.
,
from a small lip|255507004|261114002|255507004|181221003
or
palate fissure|245705000
up to a completely
malformed
face|89545001|302549007
).

The upper lip|11681001|245776003
is
formed earlier|35810008|264499004
than the palate,|261145003|181227004
from the first three lobes|255216001|421291004|232714002|421291004
named|27468005
a
to c
above.|261183002

Formation|11798007|255277001
of the palate|261145003|181227004
is
the last step in joining|398298007
the five embryonic facial lobes,|421820001|57991002|89545001
and
involves|248448006
the
back portions|260726005
of the lobes b
and
c.

These back portions|123961009|260726005|255551008|260726005|281213008|260726005|302552004|260726005|77568009|260726005
are
called
palatal shelves,|261145003
which
grow
towards each other
until
they
fuse
in the middle.|255562008|399488007

This process|415178003
is
very vulnerable|260358002
to multiple toxic substances,|260396001|35331000
environmental pollutants,|276339004
and
nutritional imbalance.

The biologic mechanisms|12893009|257544000
of mutual recognition|312020002
of the two cabinets,|420797005
and
the way
they
are
glued|57126000
together,
are
quite complex|103360007
and
obscure
despite intensive scientific research.[20]

Genetic factors|3950001|255395001
contributing
to cleft lip|80281008
and
cleft palate formation|253986002|11798007|253986002|255277001
have
been
identified|7882003
for some syndromic cases,|398241000|413769002
but
knowledge|225795001
about genetic factors|3950001|255395001
that
contribute
to the more common isolated cases|242762006|72906007|46651001|398241000|242762006|72906007|46651001|413769002
of cleft lip/palate|253983005
is
still patchy.|10027005

Many clefts run in families,|260396001|9094003|418060005|35359004|260396001|9094003|282476009|35359004
even
though
in some cases there|398241000|413769002
does
not
seem
to
be
an identifiable syndrome present,|7882003|52101004|7882003|246105001
[21] possibly|60022001
because of the current incomplete genetic understanding|15240007|255599008|3950001|66216009|15240007|255599008|255395001|66216009|15240007|255609007|3950001|66216009|15240007|255609007|255395001|66216009
of midfacial development.|278923009

A number|410680006|410681005
of genes|67271001
are
involved|248448006
including|55919000
cleft lip|80281008
and
palate transmembrane protein 1|261145003|88878007|181227004|88878007
and
GAD1,
[22] one|421379005
of the glutamate decarboxylases.|41465008

Many genes|260396001|67271001
are
known|36692007
to
play|300776002
a role
in craniofacial development|278923009
and
are
being
studied|110465008|224699009
through the FaceBase
initiative|247756008

In some cases,|398241000|413769002
cleft palate|253986002
is
caused|23981006|134198009
by syndromes
which also
cause|23981006|134198009
other problems.|74964007|55607006

Many genes|260396001|67271001
associated|47429007
with syndromic cases|398241000|413769002
of cleft lip/palate|253983005
(
see|281004000
above|261183002
)
have
been
identified|7882003
to
contribute
to the incidence
of isolated cases|46651001|398241000|46651001|413769002
of cleft lip/palate.|253983005

This
includes|55919000
in particular sequence variants|72633008|40885006
in the genes _IRF6_,|67271001
_PVRL1_
and
_MSX1_.

The understanding|66216009
of the genetic complexities|3950001|103360007|255395001|103360007
involved|248448006
in the morphogenesis|54125006
of the midface,
including|55919000
molecular|290005005
and
cellular processes,|30545007
has
been
greatly
aided|62479008|246088000
by research
on animal models,|387961004
including|55919000
of the genes _BMP4_,|67271001
_SHH_,
_SHOX2_,
_FGF10_
and
_MSX1_.[32]

Types|261664005
include|55919000
:

*
*Environmental influences|276339004
*
*
may
also
cause|23981006|134198009
,
or
interact
with genetics to
produce
,
orofacial clefting.

An example
for
how environmental factors|102487004
might
be
linked
to genetics
comes
from research
on mutations|55446002
in the gene _PHF8_|67271001
that cause cleft lip/palate|134198009|253983005
(
see|281004000
above|261183002
).

It
was
found|404684003
that _PHF8_
encodes
for a histone lysine demethylase,|418834008
[33]|264667004
and
is
involved|248448006
in epigenetic regulation.

The catalytic activity|118523000
of PHF8
depends
on molecular oxygen,|16502003
[33]|264667004
a fact
considered
important
with respect
to reports|229059009|223458004
on increased incidence|35105006|260366006
of cleft lip/palate|253983005
in mice|447612001|447482001
that
have
been
exposed|24932003
to hypoxia early|389086002|264499004
during pregnancy.|289908002

In humans,|278412004
fetal cleft lip|80281008
and
other congenital abnormalities|74964007|276654001
have
also
been
linked
to maternal hypoxia,|72705000|389086002
as
caused|23981006|134198009
by e.g.|258795003

maternal smoking,|72705000|365981007
[35] maternal alcohol abuse|169942003
or
some
forms|246176004
of maternal hypertension treatment.|288250001|276239002|288250001|416118004

Other environmental factors|74964007|102487004
that
have
been
studied|110465008|224699009
include|55919000
:
seasonal causes|21864008|134198009
(
such as pesticide exposure|59545008|71677004|59545008|24932003
)
;
maternal diet|72705000|41829006
and
vitamin intake|226349004
;
retinoids ?|372579009
which
are
members|394852005
of the vitamin A family|82622003|35359004|35359004
;
anticonvulsant drugs|255632006
;
alcohol|419442005|53041004|430837008
;
cigarette use|277889008|419385000
;
nitrate compounds|89119000|62105006
;
organic solvents|349852009
;
parental exposure to|40683002|24932003
lead|88488004
;
and
illegal drugs|77657003
(cocaine,|387085005|29142004
crack cocaine,|229003004
heroin,|387341002
etc.
).

Current research|15240007
continues|255238004
to
investigate|116698004
the extent|255590007
to which Folic acid|63718003|104660009
can
reduce|260400001
the incidence
of clefting.[37]

Traditionally,
the diagnosis|439401001
is
made
at the time|410669006
of birth|3950001
by physical examination.|5880005

Recent advances|6493001|86005002
in prenatal diagnosis|439401001
have
allowed obstetricians to|11935004
diagnose|439401001
facial clefts|92821006
in utero.[38]|35039007|264670000

Cleft lip|80281008
and
palate|261145003|181227004
is
very treatable|260358002
;
however,
the kind|261664005
of treatment|276239002|416118004
depends
on the type|261664005
and
severity|272141005
of the cleft.|9094003

Most children|410601007|160499008
with a form|246176004
of clefting
are
monitored|302805002|13288007
by a _cleft palate team_|253986002
or
_craniofacial team_
through young adulthood.|84422007|41847000

Care
can
be
lifelong.

Treatment procedures|276239002|71388002|416118004|71388002
can
vary
between craniofacial teams.

For example,
some
teams
wait
on jaw correction|661005|181811001
until the child|410601007|160499008
is
aged 10|424144002|105436006
to 12
(argument|9182005
:
growth
is
less influential|276139006|263796003
as deciduous teeth
are
replaced|282089006|370124000
by permanent teeth,|37977002
thus
saving
the child|410601007|160499008
from repeated corrective surgeries|261554009|36519005
)
,
while
other teams|74964007
correct
the jaw|661005|181811001
earlier|264499004
(argument|9182005
:
less speech therapy|276139006|5154007|263796003|5154007
is
needed|410525008|103325001
than
at a later age|260383002|424144002
when
speech therapy|5154007
becomes
harder|72505002
).

Within teams,
treatment|276239002|416118004
can
differ
between individual cases|125676002|398241000|125676002|413769002|385435006|398241000|385435006|413769002
depending
on the type|261664005
and
severity|272141005
of the cleft.|9094003

Within the first 2?3 months after birth, surgery|255216001|258706009|3950001|83578000|232714002|258706009|3950001|83578000
is
performed to|398166005
close|29179001
the cleft lip.|80281008

While
surgery to|83578000
repair|298005009|4365001
a cleft lip|80281008
can
be
performed|398166005
soon after birth, often|3950001|70232002
the preferred age|225773000|424144002
is
at approximately 10 weeks|26175008|258705008
of age,|424144002
following|255260001
the "rule|10828004
of 10s"
coined
by surgeons Wilhelmmesen|304292004
and
Musgrave
in 1969
(
the child|410601007|160499008
is
at least 10 weeks|276139006|258705008|263796003|258705008
of age|424144002
; weighs|39857003
at least 10 pounds,|276139006|258693003|263796003|258693003
and
has
at least 10g hemoglobin|276139006|38082009|263796003|38082009
).

If
the cleft|9094003
is
bilateral|51440002
and
extensive, two surgeries|41118005|420797005|83578000
may
be
required
to
close|29179001
the cleft,|9094003
one side first,|66459002|255216001|66459002|232714002
and
the second side|81170007|182353008|257997001|182353008|288495006|182353008
a few weeks later.|57176003|258705008

The most common procedure to|4757001|72906007|71388002
repair|298005009|4365001
a cleft lip|80281008
is
the _Millard procedure_|71388002
pioneered
by Ralph Millard.

Millard
performed|398166005
the first procedure|255216001|71388002|232714002|71388002
at a Mobile Army Surgical Hospital (MASH) unit|83578000|258666001|83578000|285201006|258666001
in Korea.[41]|38361009

Often|70232002
an incomplete cleft lip|255599008|80281008|255609007|80281008
requires
the same surgery|262126009|83578000
as complete cleft.|255594003|9094003

This
is
done
for two reasons.|420797005|410666004

Firstly|232714002
the group|261586004|160481000|389109008
of muscles|91727004
required
to
purse
the lips|261114002
run|418060005|282476009
through the upper lip.|11681001|245776003

In order to
restore
the complete group a full incision|255594003|272414007|261015003|34896006
must
be
made.

Secondly,|81170007
to
create
a less obvious|276139006|263796003
scar|70582006|275322007
the surgeon tries|304292004
to line up|50009006|255532002|50009006|353734004
the scar|70582006|275322007
with the natural lines|510009|50009006
in the upper lip|11681001|245776003
(
such as the edges|57183005
of the philtrum|32087006
and
tuck|10942006
away
stitches
as far|46053002
up the nose|260540009|181195007
as possible.|371930009|60022001

Incomplete cleft|255599008|9094003|255609007|9094003
gives|419582001
the surgeon more tissue to|304292004|85756007
work|261041009
with,
creating
a more supple|242762006|48162006
and
natural-|510009
looking|386548000
upper lip.|11681001|245776003

The blue lines|405738005|50009006
indicate|410535002
incisions.|34896006

Movement|255324009
of the flaps|256683004
;
flap A|256683004
is
moved|384598002|370125004
between B
and
C.

C
is
rotated slightly|263861005|425404009
while
B is
pushed|303365000|420620005
down.

Pre-operation|236874000|83578000|272113006|83578000

Post-operation,|288563008|83578000
the lip|261114002|181221003
is
swollen|442672001
from surgery|83578000
and
will
get
a more natural|242762006|510009
look|386548000
within a couple
of weeks.|258705008

See|281004000
photos
in the section|62083003|118630004
above.|261183002

In some cases|398241000|413769002
of a severe bi-lateral complete cleft,|24484000|49370004|255594003|9094003
the premaxillary segment|264193005
will
be
protruded|112639008
far|46053002
outside the mouth.|74262004|123851003|21082005|181220002

Nasoalveolar molding|79114003
prior to surgery|83578000
can
improve|385425000|3442003|385633008
long-term nasal symmetry|260540009|18772005|18772005
among patients|116154003
with complete unilateral cleft lip-cleft palate patients|255594003|304067009|261145003|116154003|255594003|304067009|181227004|116154003|255594003|66459002|253983005|116154003
compared
to correction
by surgery|83578000
alone,|105529008
according to a retrospective cohort study.|110465008|224699009

In this study,|110465008|224699009
significant improvements|386134007
in nasal symmetry|260540009|18772005|18772005
were
observed
in multiple areas|260396001|42798000
including|55919000
measurements|272391002
of the projected length|410668003
of the nasal ala|61913009
(lateral surface|49370004|410678000
of the external nose|44032009|265785009
)
,
position|246449006
of the superoinferior alar groove,
position|246449006
of the mediolateral nasal dome,|261129000|260540009|261769008|261129000|261769008
and
nasal bridge deviation.|249316004|277035007

"
The nasal ala projection length|61913009|6349000|410668003|61913009|260419006|410668003
demonstrated
an average ratio|118586006
of 93.0 percent|118582008
in the surgery-alone group|83578000|105529008|261586004|83578000|105529008|160481000|83578000|105529008|389109008
and
96.5 percent|118582008
in the nasoalveolar molding group"|79114003|261586004|79114003|160481000|79114003|389109008
this study|110465008|224699009
concluded.

Often|70232002
a cleft palate|253986002
is
temporarily
covered|255334000
by a palatal obturator|271321009
(
a prosthetic device|53350007
made
to
fit|91175000|102499006
the roof|224738009
of the mouth|74262004|123851003|21082005|181220002
covering|255334000
the gap
).

Cleft palate|253986002
can
also
be
corrected|370975003
by surgery,|83578000
usually
performed|398166005
between 6
and
12 months.|258706009

Approximately 20?25% only|26175008|419607004
require
one palatal surgery to|421379005|261145003|83578000
achieve
a competent velopharyngeal valve|32082000
capable
of producing normal, non-hypernasal speech.|17621005|25728009|258744000|25728009

However,
combinations|228166004
of surgical methods|83578000|260686004|83578000|272394005
and
repeated surgeries|261554009|36519005
are
often necessary|70232002
as the child grows.|410601007|160499008

One|421379005
of the new innovations|7147002
of cleft lip|80281008
and
cleft palate repair|359877002
is
the Latham appliance.|334251007

The Latham
is
surgically|83578000
inserted|257867005
by use|277889008|419385000
of pins|77444004
during the child's 4th|410601007|29970001|160499008|29970001
or
5th month.|32088001|258706009|32088001|259036001

After
it
is
in place,|257557008|421066005
the doctor,|309343006
or
parents,|40683002
turn|282987006
a screw daily to|68183006|69620002
bring|68369002
the cleft together to|9094003
assist|116697009|119265000
with future lip|261114002|181221003
and/or
palate repair.|276184008

If
the cleft|9094003
extends|255590007
into the maxillary alveolar ridge,|70925003|272661000|70925003|245790000
the gap
is
usually
corrected|370975003
by filling
the gap
with bone tissue.|3138006

The bone tissue|3138006
can
be
acquired|255396000
from the patients|116154003
own
chin,|30291003|362632004
rib|113197003|302523002
or
hip.|29836001|85710004

A tympanostomy tube|397760009|83059008
is
often|70232002
inserted|257867005
into the eardrum to|42859004
aerate
the middle ear.|25342003|181185000

This
is
often beneficial|70232002
for the hearing ability|47078008|371150009|118230007|371150009
of the child.|410601007|160499008

Children|410601007|160499008
with cleft palate typically|253986002
have
a variety
of speech problems.

Some speech problems
result|394617004
directly
from anatomical differences|36298004|263735002
such as velopharyngeal inadequacy.|278714002

Velopharyngeal inadequacy refers|278714002|439980006
to the inability
of the soft palate to|49460000|245784004
close|29179001
the opening|56116003
from the throat|54066008|49928004|264231000
to the nasal cavity,|279549004|263481003
which
is
necessary
for many speech sounds,
such as /p/,|20304007
/b/,
/t/,
/d/,|876000
/s/,|288495006
/z/,
etc.

This type|261664005
of errors typically
resolve
after palate repair.[46]|276184008

However,
sometimes children|410601007|160499008
with cleft palate also|253986002
have
speech errors
which
develop
as the result|394617004
of an attempt to
compensate|17275008
for the inability to
produce
the target phoneme.

These
are
known|36692007
as compensatory articulations.|39352004

Compensatory articulations|39352004
are
usually
sounds
that
are
non-existent
in normal English phonology,|17621005|297487008|17621005|25804004|258744000|297487008|258744000|25804004
often|70232002
do
not
resolve
automatically
after palatal repair,|261145003|298005009|261145003|4365001
and
make
a child?s speech even more difficult to|410601007|52925006|160499008|52925006
understand.[46][47][48]|66216009

Speech-language pathology|61909002|394595002
can
be
very beneficial to|260358002
help
resolve
speech problems
associated|47429007
with cleft palate.|253986002

In addition,|260364009
research
has
indicated|410535002
that children|410601007|160499008
who
receive
early language intervention|423637002|61909002
are
less likely to|276139006|2931005|263796003|2931005
develop
compensatory error patterns later.[49]|272135003

Hearing impairment|343087000|15188001
is
particularly prevalent
in children|410601007|160499008
with cleft palate.|253986002

The tensor muscle fibres|91727004|400293002|91727004|37202001
that
open|56116003
the eustachian tubes|91207004
lack|41277001
an anchor to|122502001
function|246464006
effectively.

In this situation,
when
the air|417696007
in the middle ear|25342003|181185000
is
absorbed
by the mucous membrane,|313268005
the negative pressure|260385009|279046003|260385009|13543005|260385009|257893003
is
not
compensated|17275008
,
which
results|394617004
in the secretion|46242002
of fluid|32457005|33463005|255765007
into the middle ear space|25342003|181185000
from the mucous membrane.|313268005

Children|410601007|160499008
with this problem typically|55607006
have
a conductive hearing loss primarily|44057004
caused|23981006|134198009
by this middle ear effusion.[51]

Note
that
each individual patient's schedule|125676002|116154003|385435006|116154003
is
treated|28995006
on a case-|398241000
by-case basis|398241000|398241000|418836005
and
can
vary
per hospital.|285201006

The table|86407004
below
shows
a common sample treatment schedule.|72906007|123038009|276239002|72906007|123038009|416118004

The colored squares|103366001|56924007
indicate|410535002
the average timeframe|7389001
in which
the indicated procedure|410535002|71388002
occurs.|272120004

In some cases|398241000|413769002
this
is
usually one procedure|421379005|71388002
(
for example lip repair|71917006
)
in other cases|74964007|398241000|74964007|413769002
this
is
an ongoing therapy|255238004|276239002
(
for example speech therapy|5154007
).

A craniofacial team
is
routinely
used|394850002
to
treat|395077000
this condition.|260905004

The majority
of hospitals still
use|277889008|419385000
craniofacial teams
;
yet others
are
making
a shift|9546005
towards dedicated cleft lip|80281008
and
palate programs.|261145003|181227004

While
craniofacial teams
are
widely knowledgeable|225795001
about all aspects
of craniofacial conditions,|260905004
dedicated cleft lip|80281008
and
palate teams|261145003|181227004
are
able to|371150009
dedicate
many
of their efforts|19487008
to
being
on the cutting edge|70302008|57183005|410717008|57183005
of new advances|7147002|86005002
in cleft lip|80281008
and
palate care.|261145003|181227004

Many
of the top pediatric hospitals|421812003|82242000
are
developing
their own CLP clinics|257585005
in order to
provide
patients|116154003
with comprehensive multi-disciplinary care|260396001
from birth|3950001
through adolescence.|22396007

Allowing
an entire team to|255503000|260232004
care
for a child|410601007|160499008
throughout their cleft lip|80281008

(
which
is
ongoing|255238004
)
allows
for the best outcomes|394617004
in every aspect
of a child's care.|268481000

While
the individual approach|125676002|385435006
can
yield
significant results,|386134007|394617004
current trends|15240007|30294006
indicate|410535002
that team
based|418836005

within different ethnic groups.|263735002|397731000

The highest prevalence rates|75540009|371879000
for
(CL ? P
)
are
reported|229059009|223458004
for Native Americans|413490006
and
Asians.|414978006

Africans|413464008
have
the lowest prevalence rates.[53]|62482003|261122009|371880002

Prevalence
of "cleft uvula"|18910001
has
varied
from .02%
to 18.8%
with the highest numbers|75540009|410680006|75540009|410681005|371879000|410680006|371879000|410681005

In some countries,|223369002
cleft lip|80281008
or
palate deformities|128336000
are
considered
reasons|410666004
(
either
generally
tolerated
or
officially
sanctioned
)
to
perform|398166005
abortion|70317007|386639001
beyond the legal fetal age limit,|398165009|57036006|255469002
even
though
the fetus|83418008
is
not
in jeopardy
of life|224130005
or
limb.|66019005|243996003

Some human rights activists|278412004|24028007
contend
this practice
of "cosmetic murder" amounts|81024003|63148005|107651007|261513001|63148005|107651007
to eugenics.

The Japanese anime _Ghost Stories_ caused controversy|414551003|23981006|414551003|134198009
through an episode featuring|272128006
a Kuchisake-onna
(
a ghost
with a Glasgow smile|425363002|225583004
because
her scar|70582006|275322007
resembled
a cleft lip.[56]|80281008

Cleft lips|80281008
and
palates|261145003
are
occasionally
seen
in cattle
and
dogs,|448771007
and
rarely|103356009
in sheep,|388254009|255392003
cats,|448169003|388618001
horses,|35354009
pandas
and
ferrets.

Most commonly,|4757001
the defect|6920004
involves|248448006
the lip,|261114002|181221003
rhinarium,
and
premaxilla.|95951008|308884009

Clefts|9094003
of the hard|72505002
and
soft palate|49460000|245784004
are
sometimes
seen
with a cleft lip.|80281008

The cause|134198009
is
usually hereditary.|255404009

Brachycephalic dogs|13649004|448771007|13649004
such as Boxers|42250008
and
Boston Terriers|79295007
are
most commonly|4757001
affected.|247591002|248448006

An inherited disorder|255404009|64572001
with incomplete penetrance|255599008|53568006|255609007|53568006
has
also
been
suggested
in Shih tzus,
Swiss Sheepdogs,|76574004
Bulldogs,|38184008
and
Pointers.|73318001

In horses,|35354009
it
is
a rare condition usually|84638005|260905004|103356009|260905004
involving|248448006
the caudal soft palate.|3583002|49460000|3583002|245784004

In Charolais cattle,|131584009
clefts|9094003
are
seen
in combination|89780004
with arthrogryposis,|111246005
which
is
inherited|255404009
as an autosomal recessive trait.|258211005

It
is
also
inherited|255404009
as an autosomal recessive trait|258211005
in Texel sheep.|132801007

Other contributing factors|74964007
may
include|55919000
maternal nutritional deficiencies,|72705000|248325000
exposure _|71677004|24932003
in utero_|35039007
to viral infections,|34014006
trauma,
drugs,|410942007
or
chemicals,|441900009
or
ingestion|111984006
of toxins|80917008
by the mother,|72705000
such as certain lupines|17162000|63876004
by cattle
during the second|81170007|257997001|288495006
or
third month|70905002|258706009|70905002|259036001
of gestation.|289908002

The use|277889008|419385000
of corticosteroids|79440004
during pregnancy|289908002
in dogs|448771007
and
the ingestion|111984006
of _Veratrum californicum_|50945007
by pregnant sheep|77386006|388254009|77386006|255392003|127362006|388254009|127362006|255392003
have
also
been
associated|47429007
with cleft formation.[75]|9094003|11798007|9094003|255277001

Difficulty|371157007
with nursing|169741004|265937000
is
the most common problem|4757001|72906007|55607006
associated|47429007
with clefts,|9094003
but
aspiration pneumonia,|422588002
regurgitation,|302769004|263854006|78104003
and
malnutrition|248325000
are
often|70232002
seen
with cleft palate|253986002
and
is
a common cause|72906007|134198009
of death.|419620001|268923008

Providing nutrition|87276001|384759009
through a feeding tube|25062003
is
often necessary,|70232002
but
corrective surgery|83578000
in dogs|448771007
can
be
done
by the age|424144002
of twelve weeks.|82809009|258705008

For cleft palate,|253986002
there
is
a high rate|75540009|371879000
of surgical failure|83578000|76797004
resulting|42752001
in repeated surgeries.|261554009|36519005

Surgical techniques|83578000|272394005
for cleft palate|253986002
in dogs|448771007
include|55919000
prosthesis,|53350007|118663006
mucosal flaps,|255607009
and
microvascular free flaps.|263809005|261238005

Affected animals|116689002
should
not
be
bred
due to the hereditary nature|255404009|277302009
of this condition.|260905004
