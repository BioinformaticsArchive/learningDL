*Ehrlichiosis|77361002
*
*
is
a tickborne[1] bacterial infection,|301811001
[2]|260306008
caused|23981006|134198009
by bacteria|409822003
of the family Anaplasmataceae,|115086004
genera _Ehrlichia_|27334000
and
_Anaplasma_.|3351007

These obligate intracellular bacteria|83167003|409822003
infect
and
kill|248007002
white blood cells.|767002|52501007

The average reported annual incidence|229059009|53281000|223458004|53281000
is
0.7 cases|398241000|413769002
per million population.[3]|385436007|389109008

been

In 2008,
human infection|278412004
by Panola Mountain|257644005
(Georgia,|278873008|223375006
USA|223688001
)
_Ehrlichia_ species|131415000
was
reported.|229059009|223458004

On August 3,
2011,
infection
by a yet-unnamed bacterium|409822003
in the genus _Ehrlichia_|27334000
carried|288345009
by deer ticks|76387006
that
has
caused flu-like symptoms|23981006|315642008|134198009|315642008
in
at least 25 people|276139006|125676002|263796003|125676002
in Minnesota|224068009
and
Wisconsin|427726005
was
reported|229059009|223458004
;
human ehrlichiosis|240626005
was
thought|88952004
to
be
very rare|260358002|84638005|260358002|103356009
or
absent|2667000
in Minnesota|224068009
and
Wisconsin.|427726005

The new species,|7147002|69658003
which
is
very similar genetically|260358002
to an _Ehrlichia_ species|131415000
found|404684003
in Eastern Europe|223643002
and
Japan|223583001
called
_E.

muris_,
was
identified|7882003
at Mayo Clinic Health System's Eau Claire hospital.[6]|223807006|310390009|263775005|246333005

_Ehrlichia_|27334000
are
transported|57188001|360300001
between cells|4421005
through the host cell filopodia|4421005|362837007
during initial stages|884001|261612004|232714002|261612004
of infection,
whereas
,
in the final stages|42796001
of infection
the pathogen|264418008
ruptures|415747007
the host cell membrane.[7]|53982002

The most common symptoms|4757001|72906007
include|55919000
headache,|25064002
muscle aches,|68962001
and
fatigue.|84229001

A rash|271807003
may
occur|272120004
,
but
is
uncommon.|103356009

Ehrlichiosis|77361002
can
also blunt
the immune system,|116003000
which
may
lead|88488004
to opportunistic infections|61274003
such as candidiasis.|78048006

Most
of the symptoms
of ehrlichiosis|77361002
can
likely|2931005
be
ascribed
to the immune dysregulation|255386009
that
it causes.|134198009

Early|264499004
in infection,
production
of TNF-alpha,|8612007
a cellular product|4421005
that
promotes
inflammation|257552002
and
immune response,|35024006
is
suppressed.|245780008

Late|260383002
in infection,
however,
production
of this substance|105590001
can
be
upregulated
by 30 fold,|26310004
which
is
likely responsible|2931005|394851003
for the "toxic shock-|18504008
like" syndrome
seen
in some severe cases|24484000|398241000|24484000|413769002
of ehrlichiosis.|77361002

Some cases|398241000|413769002
can
present|52101004|246105001
with purpura|423902002
and
in one|421379005
such case|398241000
the organisms|410653004
were
present|52101004|246105001
in such overwhelming numbers|410680006|410681005
that
in 1991 Dr.|309343006

Aileen Marty
of the AFIP
was
able to|371150009
demonstrate
the bacteria|409822003
in human tissues|272171002
using|260676000
standard stains,|397165007|127790008
and
later
proved|277025001
that
the organisms|410653004
were
indeed Ehrlichia|27334000
using|260676000
immunoperoxidase stains.[8]|397165007|127790008

Experiments
in mouse|447612001|447482001
models
further|46053002
supports|9096001|243114000
this hypothesis,
as
mice|447612001|447482001
lacking|41277001
TNF-alpha I/II receptors|8612007|42146005|116647005|8612007|22971001|116647005
are
resistant|30714006
to liver injury|39400004
caused|23981006|134198009
by ehrlichia infection.[9]|27334000

3%|260313008
of human monocytic ehrlichiosis cases|240626005|55918008|398241000|240626005|55918008|413769002
result|394617004
in death,|419620001|268923008
however
these deaths|419620001|268923008
occur|272120004
"most commonly|4757001
in immunosuppressed individuals|125676002|385435006
who
develop
respiratory distress syndrome,|46775006
hepatitis,|128241005|40468003|396423004
or
opportunistic nosocomial infections."[10]|19168005

Doxycycline|372478003
is
the drug|410942007
of choice.

For people|125676002
allergic
to drugs|410942007
of the tetracycline class,|372809001|258391009|16355005|258391009|282831004|258391009
rifampin|387159009
is
an alternative.

Early clinical experience|264499004|58147004
suggested
that chloramphenicol|372777009
may
also
be
effective, however|255403003|254648000
in vitro susceptibility testing revealed resistance.|76522002|263857004|30714006|76522002|272393004|263857004|30714006|118588007|263857004|30714006|118588007|272393004|263857004|30714006
