*Granuloma|45647009
*
*
is
a medical term|74188005
for a tiny collection
of immune cells|255386009|4421005
known|36692007
as macrophages.|58986001

Granulomas|45647009
form|246176004
when
the immune system|116003000
attempts
to wall|224727009
off substances|105590001
that
it
perceives|81742003
as foreign
but
is
unable to|371151008
eliminate.

Such substances|105590001
include|55919000
infectious organisms|410653004
such as bacteria|409822003
and
fungi|414561005
as well as
other materials|74964007|260769002
such as keratin|259987000|102665003
and
suture fragments.|18557009|29140007|408099007|29140007|360765007|29140007

A granuloma|45647009
is
therefore
a special type|67995009|261664005
of inflammation|257552002
that
can
occur|272120004
in a wide variety|90522003
of diseases.|64572001

The adjective
*
*granulomatous|255448004
*
* means _|255586005
characterized
by granulomas_.|45647009

In medical practice,|74188005
doctors occasionally|309343006
use|277889008|419385000
the term "granuloma" loosely|45647009
to mean "|255586005
a small nodule".|255507004|27925004

Since
a small nodule|255507004|27925004
can
represent
anything
from a harmless nevus|21119008
to a malignant tumor,|363346000|372087000
this usage|277889008
of the term
is
not very specific.|260358002|69658003

Examples
of the inaccurate use|263782009|277889008|263782009|419385000
of the term granuloma|45647009
are
the lesions
known|36692007
as vocal cord granuloma,|11316005
pyogenic granuloma|200722003
and
intubation granuloma,|52765003|45647009
all
of which
are
examples
of granulation tissue,|225541009
not granulomas.|45647009

"Pulmonary hyalinizing granuloma"|233742007
is
a lesion
characterized
by keloid-|33659008
like fibrosis|263756000
in the lung,|39607008|181216001
and
is
not granulomatous.|255448004

Similarly,
radiologists often|66862007|70232002
use|277889008|419385000
the term granuloma|45647009
when
they
see|281004000
a calcified nodule|255003
on X-ray|52250000|168537006|363680008
or
CT scan|77477000
of the chest.|261179002

They
make
this assumption
since
granulomas often|45647009|70232002
contain|42504009
calcium,|5540006
although
the cells|4421005
that
form|246176004
a granuloma|45647009
are
too tiny to
be
seen
by a radiologist.|66862007

The most accurate use|4757001|263656005|277889008|4757001|263656005|419385000
of the term "granuloma"|45647009
requires
a pathologist to|61207006
examine|64049009
surgically|83578000
removed|127485006
and
specially
colored|103366001
(stained|397165007|127790008
)
tissue|85756007
under a microscope.|65473004

The following|255260001
is
a more technical, accurate definition|242762006|272394005|263656005
of a granuloma|45647009
:
In pathology,|394595002
a
*
*granuloma|45647009
*
*
(classical Greek plural _granulomata_|255333006|1451003|260396001|45647009|260997001|1451003|260396001|45647009
; modern anglicized plural _granulomas_|260396001|45647009
)
is
*
*
an organized collection|385650005
of macrophages.|58986001
*
*[5][1]|264706000|264605009

Macrophages|58986001
(also
known|36692007
as histiocytes|14295007
are
the cells|4421005
that
define
a granuloma.|45647009

They often,|70232002
but
not invariably,
fuse
to
form|246176004
multinucleated giant cells|81480003
(Langhans giant cell.|30938003

The macrophages|58986001
in granulomas|45647009
are
often|70232002
referred to|439980006
as
"epithelioid".

This term refers|439980006
to the vague resemblance|25615006
of these macrophages|58986001
to epithelial cells.|4212006|395202001

Epithelioid macrophages|58986001
differ
from ordinary macrophages|58986001
in
that
they
have
elongated nuclei|84640000
that often|70232002
resemble
the sole|57999000
of a slipper|228235002
or
shoe.|43983001

They also
have
larger nuclei|255509001|84640000|263768009|84640000
than ordinary macrophages|58986001
and
their cytoplasm
is
typically more
pink|371243003
when
stained|397165007|127790008
with eosin.|411353000

These changes|243326001|263703002
are
thought|88952004
to
be
a consequence|103332005
of "activation"
of the macrophage|58986001
by the offending antigen.|7120007

The other key term|74964007
in the above definition|261183002
is
the word "|255373000
organized|385650005
"
that refers|439980006
to a tight, ball-|255365009|228187009
like formation.|11798007|255277001

The macrophages|58986001
in these formations|255277001
are
typically so tightly
clustered
that
the borders|112233002
of individual cells|125676002|4421005|385435006|4421005
are
difficult to|52925006
appreciate.

Loosely dispersed macrophages|86902002|58986001
are
not
considered
to
be
granulomas.|45647009

All granulomas,|45647009
regardless of cause,|134198009
may
contain|42504009
additional cells|260364009|4421005
and
matrix.

These
include|55919000
lymphocytes,|56972008|446325007
neutrophils,|116712007
eosinophils,|14793004|365601007
multinucleated giant cells,|81480003
fibroblasts|52547004
and
collagen|61472002
(fibrosis.|263756000

The additional cells|260364009|4421005
are
sometimes
a clue
to the cause|134198009
of the granuloma.|45647009

For example,
granulomas|45647009
with numerous eosinophils|260396001|14793004|260396001|365601007
may
be
a clue
to coccidioidomycosis|442543009
or
allergic bronchopulmonary fungal disease,|3218000
and
granulomas|45647009
with numerous neutrophils|260396001|116712007
suggest
blastomycosis,|69996000
Wegener's granulomatosis,|239934006
aspiration pneumonia|422588002
or
cat-scratch disease.|79974007

In terms
of the underlying cause,|134198009
the difference|263735002
between granulomas|45647009
and
other types|74964007|261664005
of inflammation|257552002
is
that granulomas|45647009
form|246176004
in response
to antigens|7120007
that
are
resistant|30714006
to "first-responder" inflammatory cells|255216001|256923004|232714002|256923004
such as neutrophils|116712007
and
eosinophils.|14793004|365601007

The antigen|7120007
causing|23981006
the formation|11798007|255277001
of a granuloma|45647009
is
most often|4757001|70232002
an infectious pathogen|264418008
or
a substance|105590001
foreign
to the body,|279495008|123037004
but
often|70232002
the offending antigen|7120007
is
unknown|261665006
(
as
in sarcoidosis|31541009
).

Granulomas|45647009
are
seen
in a wide variety|90522003
of diseases,|64572001
both
infectious
and
non-infectious.

Infections
that
are
characterized
by granulomas|45647009
include|55919000
tuberculosis,|371569005
leprosy,|81004002
histoplasmosis,|12962009
cryptococcosis,|42386007
coccidioidomycosis,|442543009
blastomycosis|69996000
and
cat scratch disease.|79974007

Examples
of non-infectious granulomatous diseases|191415002|255448004
are
sarcoidosis,|31541009
Crohn's disease,|34000006
berylliosis,|8247009
Wegener's granulomatosis,|239934006
Churg-Strauss syndrome,|82275008
pulmonary rheumatoid nodules|39607008|402426007|264164005|402426007
and
aspiration|14910006|278847003|129316008|68052005
of food|255620007
and
other particulate material|74964007|278694008|260769002
into the lung.|39607008|181216001

An important feature
of granulomas|45647009
is
whether
or
not
they
contain|42504009
necrosis.|6574001

Necrosis refers|6574001|439980006
to dead cells|419620001|4421005
that,
under the microscope,|65473004
appear
as a mass|300848003|118538004
of formless debris|257159000
with no nuclei|84640000
present.|52101004|246105001

A related term,|272151006|262094002
"caseation"
(literally
:
turning|282987006
to cheese|102264005
)
refers|439980006
to a form|246176004
of necrosis|6574001
that,
to the unaided eye|255367001|81745001|255367001|244486005
(i.e.,|42146005|22971001
without a microscope|65473004
)
,
appears
cheese-|102264005
like
("caseous"
)
,
and
is
typically
(
but
not uniquely
)
a feature
of the granulomas|45647009
of tuberculosis.|371569005

The identification|286672002|7882003
of necrosis|6574001
in granulomas|45647009
is
important
because
granulomas|45647009
with necrosis|6574001
tend
to
have
infectious causes.|134198009

There
are
several exceptions|261028005
to this general rule,|60132005|10828004
but
it nevertheless
remains
useful
in day-to-day diagnostic pathology.|258703001|439401001|394595002|258703001|261004008|394595002|259032004|439401001|394595002|259032004|261004008|394595002

Granuloma|45647009
without necrosis|6574001
in a lymph node|59441001|181756000
of a person|125676002
with sarcoidosis.|31541009

Granuloma|45647009
with central necrosis|26216008|6574001
in a lung|39607008|181216001
of a person|125676002
with tuberculosis.|371569005

Note
the Langhans-type giant cells|30938003
(
with many nuclei|84640000
arranged
in a horseshoe-|261369006
like pattern|272135003
at the edge|57183005
of the cell|4421005|362837007
)
around the periphery|14414005
of the granuloma.|45647009

Langhans-type giant cells|30938003
are
seen
in many types|261664005
of granulomas,|45647009
and
are
not specific|69658003
for tuberculosis.|371569005

The granulomas|45647009
of tuberculosis|371569005
tend
to
contain|42504009
necrosis|6574001
("caseating tubercules"|69824008
)
,
but
non-necrotizing granulomas|71282004
may
also
be
present.|52101004|246105001

Multinucleated giant cells|81480003
with nuclei|84640000
arranged
like a horseshoe|261369006
(Langhans giant cell|30938003
are
often|70232002
present|52101004|246105001
,
but
are
not specific|69658003
for tuberculosis.|371569005

A definitive diagnosis|261002007|439401001|261002007
of tuberculosis|371569005
requires
identification|286672002|7882003
of the causative organism|410653004
by microbiologic cultures.|19851009|252398009|19851009|61594008

In leprosy,|81004002
granulomas|45647009
are
found|404684003
in the skin|119325001|39937001|181469002
and
tend
to
involve|248448006
nerves.|3057000

The appearance|386548000|255412001
of the granulomas|45647009
differs
according to the precise type|261664005
of leprosy.|81004002

Some schistosome ova|53583001|263828003|38240000|263828003
that
are
laid
in intestinal|261093006
and
urinary venules backwash|57766006
into the liver|10200004|181268008
via the portal vein causing granuloma formation|32764006|23981006|45647009|11798007|32764006|23981006|45647009|255277001|74680004|23981006|45647009|11798007|74680004|23981006|45647009|255277001|286195007|23981006|45647009|11798007|286195007|23981006|45647009|255277001|362064007|23981006|45647009|11798007|362064007|23981006|45647009|255277001
in the liver.|10200004|181268008

Granulomas|45647009
are
seen
in most
forms|246176004
of histoplasmosis|12962009
(acute histoplasmosis,|272118002|12962009
histoplasmoma,
chronic histoplasmosis|90734009|12962009
).

_Histoplasma_ organisms|81951003|410653004
can
sometimes
be
demonstrated
within the granulomas|45647009
by biopsy|86273004
or
microbiological cultures.[1]|252398009|61594008

When
_Cryptococcus_ infection|89912005
occurs|272120004
in persons|125676002
whose immune systems|116003000
are
intact, granulomatous inflammation|11163003|6266001
is
typically
encountered.

The granulomas|45647009
can
be
necrotizing|255310005
or
non-necrotizing.|255310005

Using|260676000
a microscope|65473004
and
appropriate stains,|397165007|127790008
organisms|410653004
can
be
seen
within the granulomas.|45647009

Cat-scratch disease|79974007
is
an infection
caused|23981006|134198009
by the bacterial organism _Bartonella henselae_,|409822003|410653004|103510000
typically
acquired|255396000
by a scratch|53181008
from a kitten
infected
with the organism.|410653004

The granulomas|45647009
in this disease|64572001
are
found|404684003
in the lymph nodes|59441001
draining|32712000
the site|10546003
of the scratch.|53181008

They
are
characteristically "suppurative",|41034006
i.e.,|42146005|22971001
pus forming,|11311000|35810008|119323008|35810008
containing|42504009
large numbers|255509001|410680006|255509001|410681005
of neutrophils.|116712007

Organisms|410653004
are
usually difficult to|52925006
find
within the granulomas|45647009
using|260676000
methods routinely|260686004|272394005
used|394850002
in pathology laboratories.|394595002|261904005

Sarcoidosis|31541009
is
a disease|64572001
of unknown cause|261665006|134198009
characterized
by non-necrotizing|255310005
("non-caseating"
)
granulomas|45647009
in multiple organs|260396001|410653004
and
body sites,|116677004
[7] most commonly
the lungs|39607008
and
lymph nodes|59441001
within the chest cavity.|43799004

Other common sites|74964007|72906007|10546003
of involvement|248448006
include|55919000
the liver,|10200004|181268008
spleen,|78961009|181279003
skin|119325001|39937001|181469002
and
eyes.|81745001

The granulomas|45647009
of sarcoidosis|31541009
are
similar
to the granulomas|45647009
of tuberculosis|371569005
and
other infectious granulomatous diseases.|255448004

However,
in most cases|398241000|413769002
of sarcoidosis,|31541009
the granulomas|45647009
do
not
contain|42504009
necrosis|6574001
and
are
surrounded|355648006
by concentric scar tissue|255465008|70582006|255465008|275322007
(fibrosis.|263756000

Sarcoid granulomas often|66146003|70232002
contain|42504009
star-shaped structures|437997008|107644003|437997008|300842002
termed
asteroid bodies|55751007
or
lamellar structures|272433002
termed
Schaumann bodies.|55229003

However,
these structures
are
not specific|69658003
for sarcoidosis.|31541009

Sarcoid granulomas|66146003
can
resolve
spontaneously
without complications|116223007
or
heal|298005009
with residual scarring.|65320000|65320000|275322007

In the lungs,|39607008
this scarring|275322007
can
cause|23981006|134198009
a condition|260905004
known|36692007
as pulmonary fibrosis|51615001
that
impairs|260379002|40226000
breathing|14910006|258162000
;
in the heart,|80891009|302509004
it
can
lead|88488004
to rhythm disturbances,|272121000
heart failure|84114007|42343007
and
even death.|419620001|268923008

Crohn's disease|34000006
is
an inflammatory condition|260905004
of uncertain cause|64957009|134198009
characterized
by severe inflammation|103624008
in the wall|224727009
of the intestines|261093006
and
other parts|74964007|260726005
of the abdomen.|277112006|52731004|302553009

Within the inflammation|257552002
in the gut wall,|122865005|224727009
granulomas|45647009
are
often|70232002
found,|404684003
and
are
a clue
to the diagnosis.[9]|439401001

Pneumocystis infection
in the lungs|39607008
is
usually
not
associated|47429007
with granulomas,|45647009
but
rare cases|84638005|398241000|84638005|413769002|103356009|398241000|103356009|413769002
are
well documented to|20572008|397934002
cause|23981006|134198009
granulomatous inflammation.|6266001

The diagnosis|439401001
is
established|263748003|385645004
by finding Pneumocystis yeasts|404684003|415125002|412534006|404684003|115987006|412534006|415125002|412534006|115987006|412534006
within the granulomas|45647009
on lung biopsies.[10]|78603008

Aspiration pneumonia|422588002
is
typically
caused|23981006|134198009
by aspiration|14910006|278847003|129316008|68052005
of bacteria|409822003
from the oral cavity|74262004|181220002
into the lungs,|39607008
and
does
not
result|394617004
in the formation|11798007|255277001
of granulomas.|45647009

However,
granulomas|45647009
may
form|246176004
when
food particles|39102003
or
other particulate substances|74964007|278694008
like pill fragments|46992007|29140007
are
aspirated|68052005
into the lungs.|39607008

Patients typically|116154003
aspirate|119295008
food|255620007
because
they
have
esophageal, gastric|32849002|69695003|32849002|264010009|181245004|69695003|181245004|264010009
or
neurologic problems.|299960009

Intake
of drugs|410942007
that
depress|366979004
neurologic function|18373002
may
also
lead|88488004
to aspiration.|14910006|278847003|129316008|68052005

The resultant granulomas|45647009
are
typically
found|404684003
around the airways|43725001|89187006
(bronchioles|55214000
)
and
are
often|70232002
accompanied
by foreign-body-type multinucleated giant cells,|21386001
acute inflammation|4532008
or
organizing pneumonia.|68409003

The finding|404684003
of food particles|39102003
in lung biopsies|78603008
is
diagnostic.[11]|439401001|261004008

Necrotizing granulomas|27058005
can
develop
in patients|116154003
with rheumatoid arthritis,|69896004
typically
manifesting|250255003
as bumps
in the soft tissues|181607009
around the joints|39352004|81087007
(so-called rheumatoid nodules|223528007|402426007
)
or
in the lungs.|39607008

Granuloma annulare|65508009
is
a skin disease|95320005
of unknown cause|261665006|134198009
in which granulomas|45647009
are
found|404684003
in the dermis|53534000
of the skin.|119325001|39937001|181469002

These granulomas typically|45647009
have
a central zone|26216008
of mucin,|425757009
which
aids|62479008
in the diagnosis|439401001
when
a skin sample|119325001
is
viewed|246516004
under the microscope.|65473004

Certain inflammatory diseases|17162000|128139000
are
characterised
by a combination|89780004
of granulomatous inflammation|6266001
and
vasculitis|31996006
(inflammation|257552002
of the blood vessels|59820001
).

Both
the granulomas|45647009
as well as
the vasculitis|31996006
tend
to
occur|272120004
in association|263534001|272151006
with necrosis.|6574001

Classic examples|255333006
of such diseases|64572001
include|55919000
granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA)|443138004|46956008
(previously
referred|439980006
to
by the eponym Wegener's Granulomatosis[12]|239934006
)
and
Churg-Strauss syndrome.|82275008
