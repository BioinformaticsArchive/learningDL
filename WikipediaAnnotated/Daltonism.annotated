*Color blindness|367469000
*
*
or
*
*color vision deficiency|367469000
*

is
the inability
or
decreased ability to|1250004|371150009|260400001|371150009|260371004|371150009
see|281004000
color,|263714004
or
perceive color differences,|81742003|263714004|263735002
under normal lighting conditions.|81323004|56242006

Color blindness|367469000
affects|4065008
a significant percentage|386134007|118582008
of the population.|385436007|389109008

There
is
no actual blindness
but
there
is
a deficiency|260372006|248325000
of color vision.|61409007

The most usual cause|4757001|134198009
is
a fault|241775008
in the development|278923009
of one|421379005
or
more
sets
of retinal cones|67540009
that
perceive|81742003
color|263714004
in light|56242006|371268001
and
transmit|60117003
that information
to the optic nerve.|18234004|180938001

This type|261664005
of color blindness|367469000
is
usually
a sex-linked condition.|258139002|260905004|365952006|260905004|263495000|260905004|70256003|260905004|57312000|260905004

The genes|67271001
that
produce
photopigments
are
carried|288345009
on the X chromosome|72837006
;
if
some
of these genes|67271001
are
missing
or
damaged, color blindness|37782003|367469000
will
be
expressed
in males|248153007
with a higher probability|75540009|2931005|371879000|2931005
than
in females|248152002
because
males only|248153007
have
one X chromosome|421379005|72837006
(
in females,|248152002
a functional gene|40143009|67271001|246464006|67271001
on only|50607009|420295001
one|421379005
of the two X chromosomes|420797005|72837006
is
sufficient to|51117008
yield
the needed photopigments|410525008|103325001
).[2]|260306008

Color blindness|367469000
can
also
be
produced
by physical|5880005|19388002
or
chemical damage|441900009|37782003
to the eye,|81745001|244486005
the optic nerve,|18234004|180938001
or
parts|260726005
of the brain.|12738006|258335003

For example,
people|125676002
with achromatopsia|56852002
suffer
from a completely different disorder,|263735002|64572001
but
are
nevertheless unable to|371151008
see|281004000
colors.|263714004

The English chemist John Dalton|297487008|106256002|304608003|25804004|106256002|304608003
published
the first scientific paper|255216001|50833004|232714002|50833004
on this subject
in 1798,
"Extraordinary facts
relating|272151006|262094002
to the vision|281004000
of colours",|263714004
[3]|260313008
after the realization
of his own color blindness.|367469000

Because of Dalton's work,|304608003|261041009
the general condition|60132005|260905004
has
been
called
_daltonism_,|260030003
although
in English|297487008|25804004
this term
is
now
used|394850002
more narrowly|242762006
for deuteranopia|246674000
alone.|105529008

Color blindness|367469000
is
usually
classed|258391009
as a mild disability,|255604002|21134002
but
there
are
occasional circumstances|84638005
where it
can
give|419582001
an advantage.

Some studies|110465008|224699009
conclude
that color blind people|367469000|125676002
are
better|3442003
at penetrating certain color camouflages.|53568006|17162000|263714004|53568006|255544004|263714004

Such findings|404684003
may
give|419582001
an evolutionary reason|410666004
for the high prevalence|75540009|371879000
of red?green color blindness.[4]|246674000

The typical human retina|278412004|5665001|278412004|181171005
contains|42504009
two kinds|420797005|261664005
of light cells|56242006|4421005|371268001|4421005
:
the rod cells|17139002
(active|55561003
in low light|62482003|56242006|62482003|371268001|371880002|56242006|371880002|371268001
and
the cone cells|67540009
(active|55561003
in normal daylight.|17621005|258744000

Normally,
there
are
three kinds|421291004|261664005
of cones,|67540009
each
containing|42504009
a different pigment,|263735002|65863008
which
are
activated
when
the pigments|65863008
absorb
light.|56242006|371268001

The spectral sensitivities|365705006
of the cones|67540009
differ
;
one|421379005
is
most sensitive|4757001|83185005
to short wavelengths,|359530003|246522008|367450005|246522008
one|421379005
to medium wavelengths,|255508009|246522008
and
the third|70905002
to medium-to-long wavelengths|255508009|255511005|246522008
within the visible spectrum,|24054004
with their peak sensitivities|255587001|365705006
in the blue,|405738005
green,|371246006
and
yellow-green regions|371248007|410673009
of the spectrum,
respectively.

The absorption spectra
of the three systems|421291004|246333005
overlap|24846002
,
and
combine|20909006
to
cover|255334000
the visible spectrum.|24054004

These receptors|116647005
are
often called S cones,|70232002|67540009
M cones,|258311008|67540009
and
L cones,|258995007|67540009|420559008|67540009
for short, medium,|359530003|255508009|367450005|255508009
and
long wavelength|255511005|246522008
;
but
they
are
also often|70232002
referred to|439980006
as
blue cones,|405738005|67540009
green cones,|371246006|67540009
and
red cones,|386713009|67540009|371240000|67540009
respectively.

Although
these receptors|116647005
are
often|70232002
referred to|439980006
as
"blue,|405738005
green,|371246006
and
red" receptors,|386713009|116647005|371240000|116647005
this terminology
is
inaccurate.|263782009

The receptors|116647005
are
each responsive|80074009
to a wide range|90522003
of wavelengths.|246522008

For example,
the long wavelength,|255511005|246522008
"red",|386713009|371240000
receptor|116647005
has
its peak sensitivity|255587001|35209006|255587001|365705006
in the yellow-green,|371248007
some way
from the red end|386713009|261782000|386713009|422117008|371240000|261782000|371240000|422117008
(longest wavelength|255511005|246522008
)
of the visible spectrum.|24054004

The sensitivity|35209006|365705006
of normal color vision actually|45089002|263714004|77775007|281004000|17621005|61409007|258744000|61409007
depends
on the overlap|24846002
between the absorption
ranges
of the three systems|421291004|246333005
:
different colors|263735002|263714004
are
recognized
when
the different types|263735002|261664005
of cone|67540009|69059007
are
stimulated
to different degrees.|263735002|246173007

Red light,|285330001
for example,
stimulates
the long wavelength cones much more|255511005|246522008|67540009
than either
of the others,|74964007
and
reducing|260400001
the wavelength|246522008
causes|134198009
the other two cone systems to|74964007|420797005|67540009|246333005|74964007|420797005|69059007|246333005
be
increasingly
stimulated
,
causing|23981006
a gradual change|255343009|243326001|255343009|263703002
in hue.

Many
of the genes|67271001
involved|248448006
in color vision|61409007
are
on the X chromosome,|72837006
making
color blindness much more common|367469000|72906007
in males|248153007
than
in females|248152002
because
males|248153007
have
only one X chromosome,|50607009|421379005|72837006|420295001|421379005|72837006
while
females|248152002
have
two.|420797005

Because
this
is
an X-linked trait|263934009
an estimated 2-3%|414135002
of women|224526002
have
a 4th color cone_[citation|29970001|263714004|67540009|29970001|263714004|69059007
needed|410525008|103325001
_]
and
can
be
considered
tetrachromats
although
it
is
not
clear|263707001
that
this
provides
an advantage
in color discrimination.|263714004|311718005

Color vision deficiencies|367469000
can
be
classified|73504009
as
acquired|255396000
or
inherited.|255404009

Based|418836005
on clinical appearance,|58147004|386548000|58147004|255412001
color blindness|367469000
may
be
described
as total|258755000|255619001
or
partial.|255609007

Total color blindness|56852002
is
much less common|242762006|72906007|4757001|72906007
than partial color blindness.|255609007|367469000

There
are
two major types|420797005|255603008|261664005
of color blindness|367469000
:
those who
have
difficulty distinguishing|371157007
between red|386713009|371240000
and
green,|371246006
and
who
have
difficulty distinguishing|371157007
between blue|405738005
and
yellow.[6][7]|263935005

Any recessive genetic characteristic|3950001|255395001
that
persists
at a level|258395000|276625007
as high|75540009|371879000
as 5%|264706000|264605009
is
generally
regarded
as
having
some sort
of evolutionary advantage
over the long term,
such as better discrimination|3442003|311718005
of color|263714004
camouflaged
objects|260787004
especially
in low-light conditions.|62482003|56242006|260905004|62482003|371268001|260905004|371880002|56242006|260905004|371880002|371268001|260905004

At one time|421379005|410669006
the U.S.|223688001

Army
found|404684003
that color blind people|367469000|125676002
could
spot|23840004
"camouflage" colors|263714004
that
fooled
those
with normal color vision.|45089002|263714004|77775007|281004000|17621005|61409007|258744000|61409007

Humans|278412004
have
a higher percentage|75540009|118582008|371879000|118582008
of color blindness|367469000
than macaque monkeys|389173008|54121002
according to recent research.|6493001

It
is
worth noting,
however,
that
the effect|253861007
is
frequency dependent, because,|260864003|371154000|272123002|371154000
if
the majority
of people|125676002
were
dichromats,
camouflage dyes|61789006
would
be
selected
on the basis|418836005
of deceiving dichromats instead.

Another possible advantage|371930009|60022001
might
result|394617004
from the presence|386397008
of a tetrachromic female.|248152002|224526002

Owing to X-chromosome inactivation,|72837006
females|248152002
who
are
heterozygous|14556007
for anomalous trichromacy
ought
to
have
at least four types|276139006|421534005|261664005|263796003|421534005|261664005
of cone|67540009|69059007
in their retinae.|5665001

It
is
possible|371930009|60022001
that
this affords
them an extra dimension|255506008
of color vision,|61409007
by analogy
to New World monkeys|106939002
where heterozygous females|14556007|248152002
gain|35105006|255396000|260366006|260369004|398092000
trichromacy
in a basically dichromatic species.[11][12]|69658003

Color blindness|367469000
can
be
inherited.|255404009

It
is
most commonly|4757001
inherited|255404009
from mutations|55446002
on the X chromosome|72837006
but
the mapping|360220002
of the human genome|50470001
has
shown
there
are
many causative mutations ? mutations|260396001|55446002
capable
of causing color blindness|23981006|367469000
originate
from
at least 19 different chromosomes|276139006|89959003|263735002|263796003|89959003|263735002
and
56 different genes|263735002|67271001
(
as
shown online
at the Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM) database|246071007|248153007|246071007|339947000|246071007|278412004
at Johns Hopkins University.|224871002

Two|420797005
of the most common inherited forms|4757001|72906007|255404009|246176004
of color blindness|367469000
are
protanopia,|51445007
and
deuteranopia.|246674000

One|421379005
of the common color vision defects|72906007|61409007|6920004
is
the red-green deficiency|386713009|371246006|260372006|386713009|371246006|248325000|371240000|371246006|260372006|371240000|371246006|248325000
which
is
present|52101004|246105001
in about 8 percent|118582008
of males|248153007
and
0.5 percent|260316000|118582008
of females|248152002
of Northern European ancestry.[14]|414152003

Some
of the inherited diseases|32895009
known|36692007
to
cause|23981006|134198009
color blindness|367469000
are
:

Inherited color blindness|255404009|367469000
can
be
congenital|6160004|255399007
(
from birth|3950001
)
,
or
it
can
commence
in childhood|68433009
or
adulthood.|41847000

Depending
on the mutation,|55446002
it
can
be
stationary,|255323003
that
is
,
remain
the same|262126009
throughout a person's lifetime,|125676002
or
progressive.|255314001

As progressive phenotypes|255314001|8116006
involve|248448006
deterioration
of the retina|5665001|181171005
and
other parts|74964007|260726005
of the eye,|81745001|244486005
certain forms|17162000|246176004
of color blindness|367469000
can
progress|385651009
to legal blindness,|65956007
i.e.,|42146005|22971001
an acuity
of 6/60|260278007
or
worse,|230993007|390772001|231877006
and
often|70232002
leave|7771000|90737002
a person|125676002
with complete blindness.|255594003

Color blindness always|367469000
pertains
to the cone photoreceptors|67540009
in retinas,|5665001
as
the cones|67540009
are
capable
of detecting|260373001
the color frequencies|263714004|272123002
of light.|56242006|371268001

About 8 percent|118582008
of males,|248153007
but
only 0.5 percent|50607009|260316000|118582008|420295001|260316000|118582008
of females,|248152002
are
color blind|367469000
in some way
or
another,
whether
it
is
one color,|421379005|263714004
a color combination,|263714004|89780004
or
another mutation.|55446002

The reason males|410666004|248153007
are
at a greater risk|263768009|30207005
of inheriting|255404009
an X linked mutation|263934009|55446002
is
that males only|248153007
have
one X chromosome|421379005|72837006
(XY,
with the Y chromosome|5421003
carrying|288345009
altogether different genes|263735002|67271001
than the X chromosome|72837006
)
,
and
females|248152002
have
two|420797005
(XX|264680001
)
;
if
a woman|224526002
inherits|255404009
a normal X chromosome|17621005|72837006|258744000|72837006
in addition|260364009
to the one|421379005
that
carries|288345009
the mutation,|55446002
she
will
not
display
the mutation.|55446002

Men|339947000
do
not
have
a second X chromosome to|2603003|72837006
override
the chromosome|91272006
that
carries|288345009
the mutation.|55446002

If 5%|264706000|264605009
of variants|40885006
of a given gene|67271001
are
defective,
the probability|2931005
of a single copy|125681006|50607009
being
defective
is
5%,|264706000|264605009
but
the probability|2931005
that two copies|420797005
are
both
defective
is
0.05 ? 0.05
= 0.0025,
or
just 0.25%.

Other causes|74964007|134198009
of color blindness|367469000
include|55919000
brain|12738006|258335003
or
retinal damage|41445001
caused|23981006|134198009
by shaken baby syndrome,|102458000
accidents
and
other trauma|74964007|74964007
which
produce
swelling|423666004|442672001
of the brain|12738006|258335003
in the occipital lobe,|31065004|180923002
and
damage|37782003
to the retina|5665001|181171005
caused|23981006|134198009
by exposure|71677004|24932003
to ultraviolet light.|41355003

Damage|37782003
often|70232002
presents|52101004|246105001
itself later
on in life.|52101004|224130005|18720000|224130005

Color blindness|367469000
may
also
present|52101004|246105001
itself
in the spectrum
of degenerative diseases|362975008
of the eye,|81745001|244486005
such as age-related macular degeneration,|267718000
and
as part|260726005
of the retinal damage|41445001
caused|23981006|134198009
by diabetes.|73211009

Another factor
that
may
affect|4065008
color blindness|367469000
includes|55919000
a deficiency|260372006|248325000
in Vitamin A.[16]|82622003

The different kinds|263735002|261664005
of inherited color blindness result|255404009|367469000|394617004
from partial|255609007
or
complete loss|255594003
of function|246464006
of one|421379005
or
more
of the different cone systems.|263735002|67540009|246333005|263735002|69059007|246333005

When
one cone system|421379005|67540009|246333005|421379005|69059007|246333005
is
compromised,
dichromacy results.|394617004

The most frequent forms|4757001|70232002|246176004
of human color blindness result|278412004|367469000|394617004
from problems|55607006
with
either
the middle|255562008|399488007
or
long wavelength sensitive cone systems,|255511005|246522008|83185005|67540009|246333005|255511005|246522008|83185005|69059007|246333005
and
involve|248448006
difficulties|371157007
in discriminating reds,|311718005|386713009|311718005|371240000
yellows,|263935005
and
greens|371246006
from one|421379005
another.

They
are
collectively
referred|439980006
to
as
"red?green color blindness",|246674000
though
the term
is
an over-simplification|21481007
and
is
somewhat misleading.

Other forms|74964007|246176004
of color blindness|367469000
are
much more rare.|242762006|84638005|242762006|103356009|4757001|84638005|4757001|103356009

They
include|55919000
problems|55607006
in discriminating blues|311718005|405738005
from yellows,|263935005
and
the rarest|84638005|103356009
forms|246176004
of all,
complete color blindness|56852002
or
_monochromacy_,
where one|421379005
cannot
distinguish
any color|263714004
from grey,|229029004|371253002
as
in a black-and-white movie|315240009|413773004|315240009|185984009|315240009|371251000|413464008|413773004|413464008|185984009|413464008|371251000|15086000|413773004|15086000|185984009|15086000|371251000|371252007|413773004|371252007|185984009|371252007|371251000
or

Congenital color vision deficiencies|6160004|367469000|255399007|367469000
are
subdivided
based|418836005
on the number|410680006|410681005
of primary hues|63161005|261424001
needed|410525008|103325001
to
match|33336008
a given sample|123038009
in the visible spectrum.|24054004

Monochromacy
is
the condition|260905004
of possessing only
a single channel|125681006|255592004|50607009|255592004
for conveying information
about color.|263714004

Monochromats|79749004
possess
a complete inability to|255594003
distinguish
any colors|263714004
and
perceive|81742003
only variations|50607009|40885006|420295001|40885006
in brightness.|221668007

It
occurs|272120004
in two primary forms|420797005|63161005|246176004|420797005|261424001|246176004
:

Protanopes,
deuteranopes,
and
tritanopes
are
dichromats
;
that
is
,
they
can
match|33336008
any
color|263714004
they
see|281004000
with some mixture|272163001
of just
two|420797005
primary colors|63161005|263714004|261424001|263714004
(
whereas
normally humans|278412004
are
trichromats
and
require
three primary colors|421291004|63161005|263714004|421291004|261424001|263714004
).

These individuals normally|125676002|385435006
know|36692007
they
have
a color vision problem|61409007|55607006|263714004|397540003
and
it
can
affect|4065008
their lives|224130005
on a daily basis.|69620002|69620002|418836005

Two percent|420797005|118582008
of the male population|248153007|385436007|248153007|389109008
exhibit
severe difficulties|24484000|371157007
distinguishing
between red,|386713009|371240000
orange,|256306003|229776000|371242008
yellow,|263935005
and
green.|371246006

A certain pair|17162000
of colors,|263714004
that
seem
very different|260358002|263735002
to a normal viewer,|17621005|258744000
appear
to
be
the same color|262126009|263714004
(
or
different shades|263735002
of same color|262126009|263714004
)
for a
such dichromat.

The terms protanopia,|51445007
deuteranopia,|246674000
and
tritanopia|85049009
come
from Greek|1451003
and
literally mean "inability to|255586005
see|281004000
(_anopia_
)
with the first|255216001|232714002
(_prot-_|304383000
)
,
second|81170007|257997001|288495006
(_deuter-_

,
or
third|70905002
(_trit-_
)
[cone]",|67540009|69059007
respectively.

Those with protanomaly,|20401003|51445007|421463005|51445007
deuteranomaly,|246674000
or
tritanomaly|85049009
are
trichromats,
but
the color matches|263714004|33336008
they
make
differ
from the normal.|17621005|258744000

They
are
called
anomalous trichromats.

In order to
match|33336008
a given spectral yellow light,|263935005|56242006|263935005|371268001
protanomalous observers|51445007
need|410525008|103325001
more red light|242762006|285330001
in a red/green mixture|386713009|371246006|272163001|371240000|371246006|272163001
than a normal observer,|17621005|258744000
and
deuteranomalous observers|246674000
need|410525008|103325001
more green.|242762006|371246006

From a practical standpoint
though
,
many protanomalous|51445007
and
deuteranomalous people|246674000|125676002
have
very little difficulty|260358002|281411007|371157007|260358002|255507004|371157007
carrying|288345009
out tasks|255529000
that
require
normal color vision.|45089002|263714004|77775007|281004000|17621005|61409007|258744000|61409007

Some
may
not even
be
aware|312012004
that
their color perception|263714004|81742003
is
in any way
different|263735002
from normal.|17621005|258744000

Protanomaly|51445007
and
deuteranomaly|246674000
can
be
diagnosed|439401001
using|260676000
an instrument|57134006
called
an anomaloscope,|278809008
which
mixes|26242008|421826007
spectral red|386713009|371240000
and
green lights|285332009
in variable proportions,|255372005|8212001
for comparison
with a fixed spectral yellow.|102491009|263935005|261010008|263935005

If
this
is
done
in front|255549009
of a large audience|255509001
of males,|248153007
as
the proportion|8212001
of red|386713009|371240000
is
increased|35105006|260366006
from a low value,|62482003|371880002
first
a small proportion|255507004|8212001
of the audience
will
declare
a match,|33336008
while
most
will
see|281004000
the mixed light|26242008|56242006|26242008|371268001
as greenish
;
these
are
the deuteranomalous observers.|246674000

Next,|18769003|255260001
as
more red|242762006|386713009|242762006|371240000
is
added
the majority
will
say|66049007
that
a match|33336008
has
been
achieved.

Finally,
as yet more red|386713009|371240000
is
added,
the remaining,
protanomalous,|51445007
observers
will
declare
a match|33336008
at a point
where normal observers|17621005|258744000
will
see|281004000
the mixed light|26242008|56242006|26242008|371268001
as
definitely reddish.

_Achromatopsia_|56852002
is
strictly
defined
as the inability to
see|281004000
color.|263714004

Although
the term
may
refer|439980006
to acquired disorders|255396000|64572001
such as cerebral achromatopsia also|56852002
known|36692007
as color agnosia,|263714004|42341009
it typically
refers|439980006
to congenital color vision disorders|66091009|61409007
(i.e.|42146005|22971001

more frequently rod monochromacy|242762006|70232002|102450007
and
less frequently cone monochromacy.[21]|276139006|70232002|67540009|276139006|70232002|69059007|263796003|70232002|67540009|263796003|70232002|69059007

In cerebral achromatopsia,|56852002
a person|125676002
cannot
perceive|81742003
colors even|263714004
though
the eyes|81745001
are
capable
of distinguishing
them.

Some sources|260753009
do
not
consider
these to
be
true color blindness,|31874001|367469000
because
the failure|76797004
is
of perception,|81742003
not
of vision.|281004000

They
are
forms|246176004
of visual agnosia.[21]|25762009

Protanopia,|51445007
deuteranopia,|246674000
protanomaly,|51445007
and
deuteranomaly|246674000
are
widely common inherited colour blindness|72906007|255404009|367469000
that
affects|4065008
a substantial portion|260726005
of the human population,|278412004|385436007|278412004|389109008
in which
those affected|247591002|248448006
have
difficulty|371157007
with discriminating red|311718005|386713009|311718005|371240000
and
green hues|371246006
due to the absence|2667000|418560003
of the red|386713009|371240000
or
green retinal photoreceptors,|371246006|5665001|371246006|103067001
respectively.

It
is

:
genetic red?green color blindness|3950001|246674000|255395001|246674000
affects|4065008
males much more often|248153007|70232002
than females,|248152002
because
the genes|67271001
for the red|386713009|371240000
and
green color receptors|371246006|116647005
are
located
on the X chromosome,|72837006
of which males|248153007
have
only one|50607009|421379005|420295001|421379005
and
females|248152002
have
two.|420797005

Females|248152002
(46,
XX|264680001
)
are
red?green color blind only|246674000
if
_
both
_
their X chromosomes|72837006
are
defective
with a similar deficiency,|260372006|248325000
whereas
males|248153007
(46,
XY
)
are
color blind|367469000
if
their single X chromosome|125681006|72837006|50607009|72837006
is
defective.

The gene|67271001
for red?green color blindness|246674000
is
transmitted|60117003|258150004
from a color blind male|367469000|248153007
to all
his daughters|66089001
who
are
heterozygote carriers|14556007|47461006
and
are
usually
unaffected.

In turn,|282987006
a carrier woman|47461006|224526002|29679002|224526002
has
a fifty percent chance|118582008
of passing
on a mutated X chromosome region|55446002|72837006|410673009
to each
of her male offspring.|248153007|160499008

The sons|65616008
of an affected male|247591002|248153007|248448006|248153007
will
not
inherit|255404009
the trait
from him,
since
they
receive
his Y chromosome|5421003
and
not
his
(defective
)
X chromosome.|72837006

Should
an affected male|247591002|248153007|248448006|248153007
have
children|410601007|160499008
with a carrier|47461006|29679002
or
colorblind|367469000
woman,|224526002
their daughters|66089001
may
be
colorblind|367469000
by inheriting|255404009
an affected X chromosome|247591002|72837006|248448006|72837006
from each parent.|40683002

Because
one X chromosome|421379005|72837006
is
inactivated
at random|255226008
in each cell|4421005|362837007
during a woman's development,|224526002|278923009
it
is
possible|371930009|60022001
for her to
have
four different cone types,|421534005|263735002|67540009|261664005|421534005|263735002|69059007|261664005

and
the anomalous

and
d,|876000
the carrier|47461006|29679002
is

and
the man|248153007|339947000|278412004
is
Pd.|49049000|60022001

The daughter|66089001
is
either
PD Pd|49049000|60022001
or
pD Pd.|49049000|60022001

Suppose
she
is
pD Pd.|49049000|60022001

Each cell|4421005|362837007
in her body|279495008|123037004
expresses
either
her mother's chromosome pD|72705000|91272006|49049000|72705000|91272006|60022001
or
her father's Pd.|66839005|49049000|66839005|60022001

Thus

the anomalous pigments|65863008
for
both
colors.|263714004

Such females|248152002
are
tetrachromats,
since
they

match|33336008
an arbitrary light.|118521003|56242006|118521003|371268001

Those with tritanopia|20401003|85049009|421463005|85049009
and
tritanomaly|85049009
have
difficulty discriminating blueish|371157007|311718005

loosely,
blue?yellow color blindness.|85049009|263935005

The tritanopes neutral point
occurs|272120004
near a yellowish 570 nm
;
green|371246006
is
perceived|81742003
at shorter wavelengths|359530003|246522008|367450005|246522008

Nathans
(
with the Howard Hughes Medical Institute|74188005|385437003
proved|277025001
that
the gene coding|67271001
for the blue receptor|405738005|116647005
lies|40199007|255576009
on chromosome 7,|70488008
which
is
shared equally
by males|248153007
and
females.|248152002

Therefore
it
is
not sex-linked.|258139002|365952006|263495000|70256003|57312000

This gene|67271001
does
not
have
any neighbor|427568008
whose DNA sequence|24851008|72633008
is
similar.

Blue color blindness|85049009
is
caused|23981006|134198009
by a simple mutation|13673007|55446002
in this gene.|67271001

The Ishihara color test,|263714004|269814003|263714004|263714004|272393004
which
consists
of a series|13039001
of pictures|257445002
of colored spots,|103366001|271807003|103366001|285305004
is
the test most often|269814003|70232002|70232002|272393004|70232002
used to|394850002
diagnose|439401001
red?green color deficiencies.|386713009|371246006|260372006|386713009|371246006|248325000|371240000|371246006|260372006|371240000|371246006|248325000|386713009|371246006|260372006|386713009|371246006|248325000|371240000|371246006|260372006|371240000|371246006|248325000

A figure
(usually one|421379005
or
more Arabic digits|242762006|82680008
is
embedded
in the picture|257444003|257445002
as a number|410680006|410681005
of spots|271807003|285305004
in a slightly different color,|425404009|263735002|263714004
and
can
be
seen
with normal color vision,|45089002|263714004|77775007|281004000|17621005|61409007|258744000|61409007
but
not
with a particular color defect.|263714004|6920004

The full set of tests|261015003|269814003|261015003|272393004
has
a variety
of figure/background color combinations,|263714004|228166004
and
enable|225791005
diagnosis|439401001
of which particular visual defect|397540003
is
present.|52101004|246105001

The anomaloscope,|278809008
described
above,|261183002
is
also
used|394850002
in diagnosing anomalous trichromacy.|439401001

Because
the Ishihara color test|263714004|269814003|263714004|263714004|272393004
contains|42504009
only numerals,|50607009|421449004|420295001|421449004
it
may
not
be
useful
in diagnosing young children,|439401001|84422007|410601007|439401001|84422007|160499008
who
have
not yet
learned|69998004
to
use|277889008|419385000
numerals.|421449004

In the interest|225469004
of identifying|7882003
these problems early|55607006|264499004
on in life, alternative color vision tests|52101004|224130005|7510005|18720000|224130005|7510005
were
developed
using|260676000
only symbols|50607009|420295001
(square,|56924007
circle,|354652004
car|71783008
).

Besides the Ishihara color test,|263714004|269814003|263714004|263714004|272393004
the
US Navy
and
US
Army
also
allow
testing|272393004
with the Farnsworth Lantern Test.|257491005|269814003|257491005|257491005|272393004

This test|269814003|272393004
allows
30%
of color deficient individuals,|263714004|260372006|125676002|263714004|260372006|385435006|263714004|418446003|125676002|263714004|418446003|385435006
whose deficiency|260372006|248325000
is
not too severe, to|24484000
pass.

Most clinical tests|4757001|58147004|269814003|4757001|58147004|272393004
are
designed
to
be
fast,|16985007|277748003
simple,|13673007
and
effective|255403003|254648000
at identifying broad categories|7882003|90522003
of color blindness.|367469000

In academic studies|110465008|224699009
of color blindness,|367469000
on the other hand,|74964007|85562004|74964007|302539009
there
is
more
interest|225469004
in developing flexible tests to|261012000|269814003|261012000|272393004
collect
thorough datasets,
identify|7882003
copunctal points,
and
measure|246445000|272391002
just noticeable differences.[24]|260351008|263735002

There
is
generally
no treatment to|276239002|416118004
cure
color deficiencies.|263714004|260372006|263714004|248325000

Optometrists|28229004
can
supply|425398004
colored spectacle lenses|103366001|421591000
or
a single red-tint contact lens to|125681006|386713009|57368009|125681006|371240000|57368009|50607009|386713009|57368009|50607009|371240000|57368009
wear
on the non-dominant eye|81745001|244486005
but
,
although
this
may
improve|385425000|3442003|385633008
discrimination|311718005
of some colors|263714004
it
can
make
other colors more difficult to|74964007|263714004|52925006
distinguish.

A 1981 review
of various studies to|256220008|110465008|256220008|224699009
evaluate
the effect|253861007
of the X-chrom contact lens|57368009
concluded
that,
while
the lens|78076003|181169005
may
allow
the wearer to
achieve
a better score|3442003|278061009
on certain color vision tests,|17162000|7510005
it
did
not correct color vision|61409007
in the natural environment.[25]|224803003

The GNOME desktop environment|276339004
provides
colorblind|367469000
accessibility
using|260676000
the gnome-mag
and
the libcolorblind software.

Using|260676000
a gnome applet,
the user
may
switch
a color filter on and off choosing|263714004|116250002|263714004|258648006
from a set
of possible color transformations|371930009|263714004|61883002|60022001|263714004|61883002
that
will
displace|263739008
the colors|263714004
in order to
disambiguate
them.

The software
enables|225791005
,
for instance,
a color blind person to|263714004
see|281004000
the numbers|410680006|410681005
in the Ishihara test.|269814003|272393004

A lot
of applications|410618006
for iPhone
and
iPad
have
been
developed
to
help
colorblind people to|367469000|125676002
view|246516004
the colors|263714004
in a better way.|3442003

Many apps|260396001
launch
a sort
of simulation
of colorblind vision to|367469000|281004000
make
normal view people|17621005|246516004|125676002|258744000|246516004|125676002
understand|66216009
how
the colorblinds
see|281004000
the world.

Others ones|74964007|421379005
allow
a correction
of the image
grabbed
from the camera|14364002
with a special "daltonizer" algorithm.|67995009

In September 2009,
the journal Nature|433497004|277302009
reported|229059009|223458004
that researchers
at the University of Washington|224871002|421908005
and
University of Florida|224871002|224048003
were
able to|371150009
give|419582001
trichromatic vision|281004000
to squirrel monkeys,|52110007
which normally
have
only dichromatic vision,|50607009|281004000|420295001|281004000
using|260676000
gene therapy.[26]|394613000

In 2003,
a cybernetic device|303607000|49062001
called
eyeborg
was
developed
to
allow
the wearer
to hear sounds|47078008
representing
different colors.|263735002|263714004

Achromatopsic artist Neil Harbisson|56852002|159062006
was
the first to|255216001|232714002
use|277889008|419385000
such a device|303607000|49062001
in early 2004,|264499004
the eyeborg
allowed
him
start|255395001
painting|36864000
in color|263714004
by memorizing
the sound|68325009
of each colour.|263714004

In 2012
at a TED conference,
Harbisson
explained
how
he
could
now
perceive|81742003
colors|263714004
outside the ability|371150009
of human vision.[28]|278412004|281004000

Color blindness|367469000
affects|4065008
a significant number|386134007|410680006|386134007|410681005
of people,|125676002
although
exact proportions|8212001
vary
among groups.|261586004|160481000

In Australia,|223621005
for example,
it
occurs|272120004
in about 8 percent|118582008
of males|248153007
and
only about 0.4 percent|50607009|118582008|420295001|118582008
of females.|248152002

Isolated communities|46651001|133928008
with a restricted gene pool sometimes|263856008|67271001|69297003
produce
high proportions|75540009|8212001|371879000|8212001
of color blindness,|367469000
including|55919000
the less usual types.|276139006|261664005|263796003|261664005

Examples
include|55919000
rural Finland,|223665002
Hungary,|223638009
and
some
of the Scottish islands.|223959004

In the United States,|223688001
about 7 percent|118582008
of the male population ?|248153007|385436007|248153007|389109008
or
about 10.5 million men ?|339947000
and
0.4 percent|118582008
of the female population|248152002|385436007|248152002|389109008|224526002|385436007|224526002|389109008
either
cannot
distinguish
red|386713009|371240000
from green,|371246006
or
see|281004000
red|386713009|371240000
and
green differently|371246006
from
how others|74964007
do
(Howard Hughes Medical Institute,|74188005|385437003
2006
).

More
than 95 percent|118582008
of all variations|40885006
in human color vision|278412004|61409007
involve|248448006
the red|386713009|371240000
and
green receptors|371246006|116647005
in male eyes.|248153007|81745001

It
is
very rare|260358002|84638005|260358002|103356009
for males|248153007
or
females to|248152002
be
"blind"
to the blue end|405738005|261782000|405738005|422117008
of the spectrum.

Color codes|263714004
present|52101004|246105001
particular problems|55607006
for those with color deficiencies|103366001|260372006|103366001|248325000
as
they
are
often difficult|70232002|52925006
or
impossible
for them to
perceive.|81742003

Good graphic design avoids|20572008
using|260676000
color coding|263714004
or
using|260676000
color contrasts alone to|263714004|263543005|105529008
express
information
;
this
not only
helps
color blind people,|367469000|125676002
but
also
aids|62479008
understanding|66216009
by normally sighted people.|281004000|125676002

Designers
need|410525008|103325001
to
take|419652001
into
account
that color-blindness|367469000
is
highly sensitive|255383001
to differences|263735002
in material.|260769002

For example,
a red?green colorblind person|246674000|125676002
who
is
incapable
of distinguishing colors|263714004
on a map
printed
on paper|50833004
may
have
no such difficulty|371157007
when
viewing|246516004
the map
on a computer screen|20135006|360156006
or
television.|255712000

In addition,|260364009
some color blind people|367469000|125676002
find
it easier to|36203004
distinguish
problem colors|55607006|263714004
on artificial materials,|71967004|260769002
such as plastic|61088005
or
in acrylic paints,|256511000|36864000
than
on natural materials,|260786008
such as paper|50833004
or
wood.|14402002

Third,|70905002
for some color blind people,|367469000|125676002
color|263714004
can
only
be
distinguished
if there
is
a sufficient "mass"|51117008|300848003|51117008|118538004
of color|263714004
:
thin lines|18043004|50009006
might
appear
black|315240009|413464008|15086000|371252007
while
a thicker line|246703001|50009006
of the same color|262126009|263714004
can
be
perceived|81742003
as
having
color._[citation|263714004
needed|410525008|103325001
_]

Designers
should
also
note
that red-blue|386713009|405738005|371240000|405738005
and
yellow-blue color combinations|263935005|405738005|228166004|90998002|405738005|228166004|263935005|405738005|228166004
are
generally safe.

So|223528007
instead of the ever popular "red means|386713009|255586005|371240000|255586005
bad|556001
and
green means good" system,|371246006|255586005|20572008|246333005
using|260676000
these combinations|228166004
can
lead|88488004
to a much higher ability to|242762006|75540009|371150009|242762006|371879000|371150009|4757001|75540009|371150009|4757001|371879000|371150009
use|277889008|419385000
color|263714004
coding
effectively.

This
will
still
cause|23981006|134198009
problems|55607006
for those with monochromatic color blindness,|103366001|79749004|20401003|79749004|367469000|421463005|79749004|367469000
but
it
is
still
something
worth considering.

When
the need|410525008|103325001
to process visual information|415178003|255374006
as
rapidly|418694008
as possible|371930009|60022001
arises|68727004
,
for example
in an emergency situation,|25876001
the visual system|49549006|281831001
may
operate
only
in shades
of gray,|229029004|371253002
with the extra information load
in adding color|263714004
being
dropped._[citation|426684005|404218003

This
is
an important possibility to
consider
when
designing,
for example,
emergency brake handles|25876001|38862006
or
emergency phones.|25876001|359993007

Color blindness|367469000
may
make
it difficult|52925006
or
impossible
for a person|125676002
to engage|54986009
in certain occupations.|17162000|14679004

Persons|125676002
with color blindness|367469000
may
be
legally
or
practically
barred|257676000|428003006
from occupations|14679004
in which
color|263714004
perception|81742003
is
an essential part|34325006|260726005
of the job|14679004
(_
e.g.
,
_ mixing paint colors|26242008|36864000|263714004
)
,
or
in which
color|263714004
perception|81742003
is
important
for safety
(_
e.g.
,
_ operating vehicles|412307009
in response to
color-|263714004
coded signals
).

This occupational safety principle|87923000
originates
from the Lagerlunda train crash|62193008
of 1875
in Sweden.|223681007

Following|255260001
the crash,
Professor Alarik Frithiof Holmgren,
a physiologist,|78841004
investigated|116698004
and
concluded
that
the color blindness|367469000
of the engineer|106269003
(
who
had
died|419620001|419099009
)
had
caused|23981006|134198009
the crash.

Professor Holmgren then
created
the first test|255216001|269814003|255216001|255216001|272393004|232714002|269814003|232714002|232714002|272393004
using|260676000
different-colored skeins to|263735002|103366001
exclude|77765009
people|125676002
from jobs|14679004
in the transportation industry
on the basis|418836005
of color blindness.[29]|367469000

Color vision|61409007
is
important
for occupations|14679004
using|260676000
telephone|359993007
or
computer networking cabling,
as
the individual wires|125676002|63112008|385435006|63112008
inside the cables
are
color-|263714004

Electronic wiring,|258097001|14133008

are
color-|263714004
coded
as well,|20572008

Some countries|223369002
(
for example,
Romania|223655008
have
refused|443390004
to grant driving licenses|129060000
to individuals|125676002|385435006
with color blindness.|367469000

In Romania,|223655008
there
is
an ongoing campaign to|255238004
remove|127485006
the legal restrictions|398165009|263856008
that
prohibit
colorblind|367469000
citizens
from getting drivers' licenses.[32]|236320001

The usual justification|410666004
for such restrictions|263856008
is
that drivers|236320001
of motor vehicles|46160005
must
be
able to|371150009
recognize
color-coded signals,|263714004
such as traffic lights|257720004
or
warning lights.|56242006

While
many aspects
of aviation
depend
on color coding,|263714004
only
a few|57176003
of them
are
critical enough to
be
interfered|78235001
with
by some milder types|255604002|261664005
of color blindness.|367469000

Some examples
include|55919000
color-gun signaling|263714004|38952000
of aircraft|21753002
that
have
lost radio communication,|360004001|263536004
color-coded glide-path indications|263714004|60763003|410666004
on runways,
and
the like.

Some jurisdictions
restrict|263856008
the issuance
of pilot credentials|308040008
to persons|125676002
who
suffer
from color blindness|367469000
for this reason.|410666004

Restrictions|263856008
may
be
partial,|255609007
allowing
color-blind persons to|263714004
obtain|398092000
certification
but
with restrictions,|263856008
or
total,|258755000|255619001
in which case color-blind persons|398241000|263714004
are
not
permitted|958006
to
obtain|398092000
piloting credentials|308040008
at all.

In the United States,|223688001
the Federal Aviation Administration|413454004|416118004
requires
that pilots|308040008
be
tested|272393004
for normal color vision|45089002|263714004|77775007|281004000|17621005|61409007|258744000|61409007
as part|260726005
of their medical clearance|74188005|260695007
in order to
obtain|398092000
the required medical certificate,|74188005|308707006
a prerequisite
to obtaining|398092000
a pilot's certification.|308040008

If
testing|272393004
reveals|263857004
color blindness,|367469000
the applicant
may
be
issued|55607006
a license
with restrictions,|263856008
such as no night flying|2546009|257736002
and
no flying|257736002
by color signals?|263714004
such a restriction effectively|263856008
prevents|116699007
a pilot|308040008
from obtaining|398092000
a commercial pilot certification,|308040008
thereby
preventing|116699007
the pilot|308040008
from engaging|54986009
in corporate
(private
)
or
commercial
(public
)
piloting operations.|308040008|83578000

The government
allows
several types of tests,|261028005|246246002
including|55919000
medical standard tests|74188005|269814003|74188005|272393004
(_
e.g.
,
_
the Ishihara,
Dvorine,
and
others|74964007
)
and
specialized tests|67995009|269814003|67995009|272393004|269814003|272393004
oriented|311552005
specifically
to the needs|410525008|103325001
of aviation.

If
an applicant
fails
the standard tests,|269814003|272393004
he
or
she
will
receive
a restriction|263856008
on their medical|74188005
certificate|308707006
that states- "Not valid|398070004
for night flying|2546009|257736002
or
by color signal control."|263714004|31509003
He/
she
may
apply|410618006|417924000
to the FAA to
take|419652001
a specialized test,|67995009|269814003|67995009|67995009|272393004|269814003|272393004
administered|418283001
by the FAA.

Typically,
this test|269814003|272393004
is
the "color vision light gun test."|7510005|56242006|7510005|371268001
For this
test|269814003|272393004
an FAA inspector
will
meet|229057006
the pilot|308040008
at an airport|257562009
with an operating control tower,|31509003
and
the color signal light gun|263714004|56242006|263714004|371268001
will
be
shone
at the pilot|308040008
from the tower,
and
he
or
she
must
identify|7882003
the color.|263714004

If
he passes,
he
may
be
issued|55607006
a waiver,
which
states|398070004
that
the color vision test|7510005
is
no longer|255511005
required
during medical examinations.|225886003

He
will
then
receive
a new medical|7147002|74188005
certificate|308707006
with the restriction|263856008
removed.|127485006

This
was
once
a Statement of Demonstrated Ability (SODA),|371150009
but
the SODA|371150009
was
dropped|426684005|404218003
,
and
converted
to a simple waiver|13673007
(letter|126202002
)
early|264499004
in the 2000s.[33]|264667004

which
could
lead|88488004
to a 35% reduction|58294000|260400001|289928003
in the number|410680006|410681005
of prospective pilots|308040008
who
fail
to
meet|229057006
the minimum medical threshold.[34]|255605001|74188005|118589004|255604002|74188005|118589004

Inability to
distinguish
color|263714004
does
not necessarily
preclude
the ability to|371150009
become
a celebrated artist.|159062006

The expressionist painter Clifton Pugh,|106510009
three-time winner|421291004|410669006
of Australia's Archibald Prize,|223621005
on biographical, gene inheritance|67271001|246071007
and
other grounds|74964007
has
been
identified|7882003
as a protanope.

19th century French artist Charles M?ryon|19434008|159062006
became
successful|385669000
by concentrating
on etching
rather than
painting
after
he
was
diagnosed|439401001
as
having
a red?green deficiency.[36]|386713009|371246006|260372006|386713009|371246006|248325000|371240000|371246006|260372006|371240000|371246006|248325000

A Brazilian court
ruled|10828004
that people|125676002
with color blindness|367469000
are
protected
by the Inter-American Convention|11896004|255333006
on the Elimination|63911002
of All
Forms|246176004
of Discrimination|311718005
against Person|125676002
with Disabilities.[37][38][39]|21134002|264670000

At trial,|110465008
it
was
decided
that
the carriers|47461006
of color blindness|367469000
have
a right|24028007
of access|260507000
to wider knowledge,|90522003|225795001
or
the full enjoyment|261015003|112080002
of their human condition.|278412004|260905004

Color blindness very rarely means|367469000|260358002|103356009|255586005
complete|255594003
monochromatism.|56852002

In almost
all cases,|398241000|413769002
color blind people|367469000|125676002
retain|397909002
blue?yellow discrimination,|405738005|263935005|311718005
and
most color-blind individuals|367469000|125676002|367469000|385435006
are
anomalous trichromats
rather than
complete dichromats.|255594003

In practice|52101004|18720000
this means|255586005
that
they often|70232002
retain|397909002
a limited discrimination|255469002|311718005
along the red?green axis|386713009|371246006|39976000|386713009|371246006|388282002|371240000|371246006|39976000|371240000|371246006|388282002
of color space,|263714004
although
their ability to|371150009
separate|263869007
colors|263714004
in this dimension|255506008
is
severely|24484000
reduced.|260400001

Dichromats often|70232002
confuse|286933003
red|386713009|371240000
and
green items.|371246006

For example,
they
may
find
it difficult to|52925006
distinguish
a Braeburn apple|46051000|67505008|229775001|256311001
from a Granny Smith|308323009
and
in some cases,|398241000|413769002
the red|386713009|371240000
and
green|371246006
of traffic light|257720004
without other clues|74964007
(
for example,
shape|107644003|246176004|300842002
or
position|246449006
).

The vision|281004000
of dichromats
may
also
be
compared
to images
produced
by a color|263714004
printer
that
has
run|418060005|282476009
out of the ink|46384008
in one|421379005
of its three color cartridges|421291004|263714004
(
for protanopes
and
deuteranopes,
the magenta cartridge,|50062004
and
for tritanopes,
the yellow cartridge|263935005
).

Dichromats
tend
to
learn|69998004
to
use|277889008|419385000
texture|246200002
and
shape clues|107644003|246176004|300842002
and
so|223528007
are
often able to|70232002|371150009
penetrate|53568006
camouflage
that

individuals|125676002|385435006

Traffic light colors|257720004|263714004
are
confusing|286933003
to some dichromats
as
there
is
insufficient apparent difference|71978007|263735002|423437008|263735002
between the red/amber traffic lights,|285330001
and
that
of sodium street lamps|39972003|257710009|34160005|39972003|398099009|34160005
;
also
the green|371246006
can
be
confused|286933003
with a grubby white lamp.|65281001|413773004|34160005|65281001|185984009|34160005|65281001|371251000|34160005

This
is
a risk factor|80943009
on high-speed undulating roads|75540009|272510001|371879000|272510001
where angular cues|1483009
cannot
be
used.|394850002

British Rail color lamp signals|263714004|34160005
use|277889008|419385000
more easily identifiable colors|242762006|36203004|7882003|263714004
:
the red|386713009|371240000
is
blood red,|87612001|386713009|87612001|371240000|119273009|386713009|119273009|371240000
the amber
is
yellow|263935005
and
the green|371246006
is
a bluish color.|263714004

Most British road traffic lights|4757001|272510001|257720004
are
mounted|246143003
vertically
on a black rectangle|315240009|59410002|413464008|59410002|15086000|59410002|371252007|59410002
with a white border|413773004|112233002|185984009|112233002|371251000|112233002
(
forming|35810008
a "sighting board"|281004000
)
and
so dichromats|223528007
can
look|386548000
for the position|246449006
of the light|56242006|371268001
within the rectangle ? top,|59410002|421812003

In the Eastern provinces
of Canada horizontally mounted traffic lights|223686002|246143003|257720004
are
generally
differentiated|263933003
by shape to|107644003|246176004|300842002
