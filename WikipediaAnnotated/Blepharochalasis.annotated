*Blepharochalasis|47704002
*
*
is
an inflammation|257552002
of the eyelid|80243003|265782007
that
is
characterized
by exacerbations
and
remissions|277022003
of eyelid edema,|89091004
which
results|394617004
in a
stretching|122546009
and
subsequent atrophy|255260001|13331008
of the eyelid tissue|80243003|85756007|265782007|85756007
resulting|42752001
in redundant folds|160901009|26310004|26310004
over the lid margins.|77024004

It typically
affects|4065008
only
the upper eyelids,|38934000|244499008
and
may
be
unilateral|66459002
as well as
bilateral.[1]|51440002

Blepharochalasis|47704002
results|394617004
from recurrent bouts|255227004
of painless eyelid swelling,|255350008|193967004
each
lasting
for several days.|261028005|258703001

This
is
thought to|88952004
be
a form|246176004
of localized angioedema,|255471002|400075008
or
rapid accumulation|255358001
of fluid|32457005|33463005|255765007
in the tissues.|85756007

Recurrent episodes|263853000
lead|88488004
to thin|18043004
and
atrophic skin.|399979006

Damage|37782003
to the levator palpebrae superioris muscle|58641002|91727004|244774006|91727004
causes|134198009
ptosis,|11934000|29696001
or
drooping
of the eyelid,|80243003|265782007
when
the muscle|91727004
can
no longer|255511005
hold|421139008
the eyelid|80243003|265782007
up.

Blepharochalasis|47704002
is
idiopathic|54690008
in most cases,|398241000|413769002
i.e.,|42146005|22971001
the cause|134198009
is
unknown.|261665006

Systemic conditions|31099001|260905004
linked
to blepharochalasis|47704002
are
renal agenesis,|204942005
vertebral abnormalities,|420345000|276654001
and
congenital heart disease.|13213009

It
is
encountered more commonly
in younger|84422007
rather than
older individuals.|70753007|125676002|70753007|385435006

Complications|116223007
of blepharochalasis|47704002
may
include|55919000
conjunctival hyperemia|359610006|193894004
(excessive blood flow|260378005|58190003
through the moist tissues|17461003|85756007
of the orbit|363654007|181143004
)
,
chemosis,|8148005
entropion,|33168009
ectropion,|62909004
and
ptosis.|11934000|29696001

Dermatochalasis|58588007|246815009
is
sometimes
confused|286933003
with blepharochalasis,|47704002
but
these
are
two different conditions.|420797005|263735002|260905004

A surgeon|304292004
trained|118629009|62193008
to do eyelid surgery,|80243003|83578000|265782007|83578000
such as a plastic surgeon|8724009
or
ophthalmologist,|422234006
is
required to
decide
and
perform|398166005
the appropriate surgical procedure.|83578000

Following|255260001
procedures|71388002
have
been
described
for blepharochalasis|47704002
:

These
are
used|394850002
to correct atrophic blepharochalasis|399979006|47704002|13331008|47704002
after the syndrome
has
run|418060005|282476009
its course.|288524001
