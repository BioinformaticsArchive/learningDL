[1]|260305007
is
a parasitic disease|17322007
caused|23981006|134198009
by _Cryptosporidium_,|83821001
a protozoan parasite|46770001
in the phylum Apicomplexa.|106604000

It
affects|4065008
the intestines|261093006
and
is
typically
an acute short-term infection.|63171007

It
is
spread|410677005
through the fecal-oral route,|39477002|26643006
often|70232002
through contaminated water|102414000
;[1]|260305007
the main symptom|63161005
is
self-limiting diarrhea|255469002|398032003
in people|125676002
with intact immune systems.|11163003|116003000

In immunocompromised individuals,|370391006|125676002|370391006|385435006
such as AIDS patients,|62479008|116154003
the symptoms
are
particularly severe|24484000
and
often fatal.|70232002|399166001

_Cryptosporidium_|83821001
is
the organism most commonly|410653004
isolated|46651001
in HIV positive patients|402916007|116154003
presenting|246105001
with diarrhea.|398032003

Treatment|276239002|416118004
is
symptomatic,|264931009
with fluid rehydration,|32457005|243221009|33463005|243221009|255765007|243221009|243221009
electrolyte correction|86355000
and
management|413454004|119270007
of any pain.|22253000

Despite
not
being
identified|7882003
until 1976,
it
is
one|421379005
of the most common waterborne diseases|4757001|72906007|64572001
and
is
found worldwide.|404684003

The parasite|37763007
is
transmitted|60117003|258150004
by environmentally hardy microbial cysts|441457006
(oocysts|103541004
)
that,
once
ingested|111984006
,
exist
in the small intestine|264196002|181250005
and
result|394617004
in an infection
of intestinal epithelial tissue.|72517000|266135004

_Cryptosporidium andersoni_|83821001

The organism|410653004
was
first|255216001|232714002
described
in 1907
by Tyzzer,
who
recognised
it
was
a coccidian.|106605004

_Cryptosporidium_|83821001
is
a protozoan pathogen|417396000|264418008
of the Phylum Apicomplexa|106604000
and
causes|134198009
a diarrheal illness|398032003|39104002
called
cryptosporidiosis.|58777003

Other apicomplexan pathogens|74964007|264418008
include|55919000
the malaria parasite _Plasmodium_,|34706006
and
_Toxoplasma_,|61949005
the causative agent|362944004
of toxoplasmosis.|187192000

Unlike _Plasmodium_,|34706006
which
transmits|60117003
via a mosquito vector,|359768004|260529001
_Cryptosporidium_|83821001
does
not
require
an insect vector|106763003|260529001
and
is
capable
of completing|255594003
its life cycle|224130005|44180009
within a single host,|125681006|50607009
resulting|42752001
in microbial cyst stages|441457006|261612004|103552005|261612004
which
are
excreted|418678001
in feces|39477002
and
are
capable
of transmission|258150004
to a new host.|7147002

However,
studies|110465008|224699009
show
that synanthropic filth flies|367378007
may
be
involved|248448006
in the transmission|258150004
of human|278412004
and
animal cryptosporidiosis.[2]|387961004|58777003

The pattern|272135003
of _Cryptosporidium_ life cycle|83821001|224130005|44180009
fits|91175000
well|20572008
that
of other intestinal homogeneous coccidian genera|74964007|261093006|106605004|18511007
of the suborder _Eimeriina_
:
macro-
and
microgamonts

independently
;
a microgamont

and
oocysts|103541004

for parasites'|37763007
spreading|410677005
in the environment.|276339004

Electron microscopic studies|73512001
made
from the 1970s
have
shown
the intracellular,|83167003
although
extracytoplasmic localization|257880008
of _Cryptosporidium_ species.|372395005

These species|69658003
possess
a number|410680006|410681005
of unusual features
:

DNA studies|24851008|110465008|24851008|224699009
suggest
a relationship|272151006
with the gregarines
rather than
the coccidia.|106605004

The taxonomic position|246449006
of this group|261586004|160481000|389109008
has
not yet
been
finally
agreed
upon.

The genome|18470003
of _Cryptosporidium parvum_|51504002
was
sequenced|72633008
in 2004
and
was
found|404684003
to
be
unusual
amongst Eukaryotes|415671008
in
that
the mitochondria|75056005

The parasite|37763007
is
transmitted|60117003|258150004
by environmentally hardy microbial cysts|441457006
(oocysts|103541004
)
that,
once
ingested|111984006
,
exist
in the small intestine|264196002|181250005
and
result|394617004
in an infection
of intestinal epithelial tissue.|72517000|266135004

Infection
is
through contaminated material|62604006|260769002
such as earth,
water,|11713004|119318008
uncooked
or
cross-contaminated food|228034007
that
has
been
in contact|52101004|11723008|52101004|70862002|18720000|11723008|18720000|70862002
with the feces|39477002
of an infected individual|125676002|385435006
or
animal.|387961004

Contact|11723008|70862002
must
then
be
transferred|129347002
to the mouth|74262004|123851003|21082005|181220002
and
swallowed.|54731003

It
is
especially prevalent
amongst those in regular contact|52101004|17854005|11723008|52101004|17854005|70862002|18720000|17854005|11723008|18720000|17854005|70862002

of fresh water|5024000
including|55919000
recreational water|11713004|119318008

Other potential sources|74964007|30207005|260753009
include|55919000
insufficiently treated water supplies,|28995006|11713004|425398004|28995006|119318008|425398004
contaminated food,|228034007

to disinfectants|311942001
such as chlorine bleach|29276003|76885009|76885009
enables|225791005
them to
survive
for long periods|255511005|259037005
and
still
remain
infective.

Some outbreaks|443684005
have
happened
in day care|258703001|259032004
related|272151006|262094002
to diaper changes.[7]|52065008|243326001|52065008|263703002

Symptoms
appear
from two|420797005
to ten days|23067006|258703001|420258001|258703001
after infection,
with an average
of 7 days,|258703001
[1]|260305007
and
last
for
up to two weeks,|420797005|258705008

in some cases,|398241000|413769002
up to one month.|421379005|258706009|421379005|259036001

There
are
3 possible forms|260313008|371930009|246176004|260313008|60022001|246176004
of the illness|39104002
in immunocompetent people.|35194002|125676002

The disease|64572001
can
be
asymptomatic|84387000
or
cause|23981006|134198009
acute diarrhea|409966000
or
persistent diarrhea|398032003
that
can
last
for a few weeks.|57176003|258705008

Diarrhea|398032003
is
usually watery|263930000
with mucus.|49909006

It
is
very rare to|260358002|84638005|260358002|103356009
find
blood|87612001|119273009
or
leukocytes|52501007
in the diarrhea.[8]|398032003

As well as
watery diarrhea,|263930000|398032003
there
is
often stomach pains|70232002|271681002
or
cramps|55300003
and
a low fever.|62482003|386661006|371880002|386661006

Other symptoms|74964007
include|55919000
nausea,|422587007
vomiting|249497008
,
[9] malabsorption[10]|32230006
and
dehydration.|34095006

The individuals|125676002|385435006
who
are
asymptomatic|84387000
(
have
no symptoms
)
are
nevertheless infective,
and
thus
can
pass
on the infection
to others.|74964007

Even
after symptoms
have
finally
subsided
an individual|125676002|385435006
is
still infective
for some weeks.|258705008

Severe diseases,|24484000|64572001
including|55919000
pancreatitis,|75694006
can
occur.[12]|272120004

Immunocompromised people,|370391006|125676002
as well as
very young|260358002|84422007
or
very old people,|260358002|70753007|125676002
can
develop
a more severe form|242762006|24484000|246176004
of cryptosporidiosis.|58777003

There
are
4 clinical presentations|260308009|58147004|246105001
for patients|116154003
with AIDS.|62479008

4%|260308009
have
no symptoms,
29%
have
a transient infection,|14803004
60%
have
chronic diarrhea,|236071009
and
8%
have
a severe, cholera-like infection.|24484000|63650001

With transient infections diarrhea|14803004|111939009
ends|261782000
within 2 months|260306008|258706009
and
Cryptosporidium|83821001
is
no longer|255511005
found|404684003
in the feces.|39477002

Chronic diarrhea|236071009
is
diarrhea|398032003
that lasts
for 2|260306008
or
more months.|242762006|258706009

The most severe form|4757001|24484000|246176004
results|394617004
in the patients|116154003
excreting|418678001
at least 2 liters|276139006|258770004|263796003|258770004
of watery diarrhea|263930000|398032003
per day.|258703001|259032004

They
can
lose
up to 25 liters|258770004
per day.|258703001|259032004

AIDS patients|62479008|116154003
can
have
up to 10 stools|39477002
per day.|258703001|259032004

They
experience
severe malabsorption|24484000|32230006
and
can
have
10% weight loss.|89362005

Many
of them never completely
eliminate
_Cryptosporidium_|83821001
from their bodies.[8]|279495008|123037004

When
_Cryptosporidium_ spreads|83821001|410677005
beyond the intestine,|261093006
as
it
can
predominantly
in patients|116154003
with AIDS,|62479008
it
can
reach|282679008
the lungs,|39607008
middle ear,|25342003|181185000
pancreas,|15776009|181277001
and
stomach.|69695003|181246003

Thus,
one symptom|421379005
is
pain|22253000
in the right upper quadrant.|255497008

The parasite|37763007
can
infect
the biliary tract,|34707002|181267003
causing|23981006
biliary cryptosporidiosis.|70150004|58777003

This
can
result|394617004
in cholecystitis|76581006
and
cholangitis.[14]|82403002

_Cryptosporidium_|83821001
has
a spore phase|255811001|21191007|263883009|21191007
(oocyst|103541004
and
in this state|398070004
it
can
survive
for lengthy periods|410668003|259037005
outside a host.

It
can
also
resist
many common disinfectants,|72906007|311942001
notably chlorine-based disinfectants.[16]|29276003|311942001|29276003|418836005|311942001|311942001|418836005|311942001

The life cycle|224130005|44180009
of _Cryptosporidium parvum_|51504002
consists
of an asexual stage|21191007|371508000|261612004
and
a sexual stage.|365952006|21191007|365952006|371508000|365952006|261612004

After
being
ingested,|111984006
the oocysts|103541004
excyst
in the small intestine.|264196002|181250005

They
release|58000006|68776005|258760001|129299003|115956009
sporozoites|103545008
that attach|102491009
to the microvilli|49690003
of the epithelial cells|4212006|395202001
of the small intestine.|264196002|181250005

From there
they
become
trophozoites|103551003
that
reproduce
asexually
by multiple fission,|260396001
a process|415178003
known|36692007
as schizogony.

The trophozoites|103551003
develop
into Type 1 meronts [1]|258191002|103544007
that
contain|42504009
8 daughter cells.[14]|66089001|4421005

These daughter cells|66089001|4421005
are
Type 1 merozoites,|258191002|103543001
which
get
released|68776005|129299003
by the meronts.|103544007

Some
of these merozoites|103543001
can
cause|23981006|134198009
autoinfection
by attaching|102491009
to epithelial cells.|4212006|395202001

Others|74964007
of these merozoites|103543001
become
Type II meronts,|258195006|103544007
[15]
which
contain|42504009
4 Type II merozoites.|260308009|258195006|103543001

These merozoites|103543001
get
released|68776005|129299003
and
they
attach|102491009
to the epithelial cells.|4212006|395202001

From there
they
become
either
macrogamonts
or
microgamonts.

These
are
the female|248152002|224526002
and
male sexual forms,|248153007|365952006|246176004
respectively.

This stage,|21191007|371508000|261612004
when
sexual forms|365952006|246176004
arise|68727004
,
is
called gametogony.[17]

Zygotes|57323001
are
formed|35810008
by microgametes
from the microgamont
penetrating|53568006
the macrogamonts.

The zygotes|57323001
develop
into oocysts|103541004
of two types.|420797005|261664005

20%
of oocysts|103541004
have
thin walls|18043004|224727009
and
so|223528007
can
reinfect|255230006
the host
by rupturing|415747007|263862003
and
releasing sporozoites|129299003|103545008
that
start|255395001
the process over again.|415178003|21481007

The thick-walled oocysts|246703001|68947003|103541004
are
excreted|418678001
into the environment.|276339004

The oocysts|103541004
are
mature|34071009
and
infective
upon
being
excreted.|418678001

They
can
survive
in the environment|276339004
for months.[18]|258706009

The oocysts|103541004
are
ovoid|84360004
or
spherical|34258004
and
measure 5|246445000|272391002
to 6 micrometers|258674000
across.

When
in flotation preparations|225106003
they
appear
highly|75540009
refractile.

The oocysts|103541004
contains|42504009
up to 4 sporozoites|260308009|103545008
that
are
bow-|299331007
shaped.[10]|107644003|300842002

As few
as 2|260306008
to 10 oocysts|103541004
can
initiate
an infection.

The parasite|37763007
is
located
in the brush border|17599007
of the epithelial cells|4212006|395202001
of the small intestine.|264196002|181250005

They
are
mainly
located
in the jejunum.|261103000|181248002

When
the sporozoites|103545008
attach|102491009
the epithelial cells? membrane envelops|53982002
them.

Thus,
they
are ?intracellular|83167003
but
extracytoplasmic?.

The parasite|37763007
can
cause|23981006|134198009
damage|37782003
to the microvilli|49690003
where it attaches.|102491009

The infected human|278412004
excretes|418678001
the most oocysts|4757001|103541004
during the first week.|255216001|258705008|255216001|259038000|232714002|258705008|232714002|259038000

Oocysts|103541004
can
be
excreted|418678001
for weeks|258705008
after the diarrhea subsides.[1]|398032003

The immune system|116003000
reduces|260400001
the formation|11798007|255277001
of Type 1 merozoites|258191002|103543001
as well as
the number|410680006|410681005
of thin-walled oocysts.|18043004|68947003|103541004

This
helps
prevent
autoinfection.

B cells|112130006
do
not
help
with the initial response|884001|232714002
or
the fight to|248005005
eliminate
the parasite.[15]|37763007

There
are
many diagnostic tests|260396001|103693007
for _Cryptosporidium_.|83821001

They
include|55919000
microscopy,|117259009
staining|127790008
,
and
detection
of antibodies.|68498002

Microscopy [1]|117259009
can
help
identify|7882003
oocysts|103541004
in fecal matter.|39477002

To
increase|260366006
the chance
of finding|404684003
the oocysts,|103541004
the diagnostician
should
inspect
at least 3 stool samples.|276139006|119339001|263796003|119339001

There
are
several techniques to|261028005|272394005
concentrate
either
the stool sample|119339001
or
the oocysts.|103541004

The modified formalin-ethyl acetate (FEA) concentration method|431510009|83298009|82742001|260686004|431510009|83298009|82742001|272394005|243326001|431510009|83298009|82742001|260686004|243326001|431510009|83298009|82742001|272394005
concentrates
the stool.|39477002

Both
the modified zinc sulfate centrifugal flotation technique|387367007|398475002|272394005|243326001|387367007|398475002|272394005
and
the Sheather?s sugar flotation procedure|2331003|71388002|74801000|71388002
can
concentrate
the oocysts|103541004
by causing|23981006
them to
float.

Another form|246176004
of microscopy|117259009
is
fluorescent microscopy|35352008|117259009
done
by staining|127790008
with auramine.[13]|81397005

Other staining techniques|74964007|127790008|272394005
include|55919000
acid-fast staining,|406976001|127790008
[15]
which
will
stain|397165007|127790008
the oocysts red.|103541004|386713009|103541004|371240000

One type|421379005|261664005
of acid-fast stain|67122001|406976001
is
the Kinyoun technique.|272394005

Giemsa staining|104208006
can
also
be
performed.|398166005

Part|260726005
of the small intestine|264196002|181250005
can
be
stained|397165007|127790008
with hematoxylin and eosin (H & E),|20401003|12710003|411353000|421463005|12710003|411353000
which
will
show
oocysts|103541004
attached|102491009
to the epithelial cells.[10]|4212006|395202001

Detecting antigens|260373001|7120007
is
yet
another way to
diagnose|439401001
the disease.|64572001

This
can
be
done with direct fluorescent antibody (DFA) techniques.|385658003|255589003|5733007|422117008|255589003|5733007

It
can
also
be
achieved
through indirect immunofluorescence assay.|127797006|58779000|127797006|272392009|255541007|30662005

Enzyme-Linked ImmunoSorbent Assay (ELISA) also|76978006
detects|260373001
antigens.[13]|7120007

Polymerase chain reaction (PCR)|258066000
is
another way to
diagnose|439401001
cryptosporidiosis.|58777003

It
can
even
identify|7882003
the specific species|69658003
of _Cryptosporidium_.|83821001

If
the patient|116154003
is
thought to|88952004
have
biliary cryptosporidiosis,|70150004|58777003
then
an appropriate diagnostic technique|103693007
is
ultrasonography.|359659005

If
that returns normal results,|7528007|280413001
the next step|18769003|398298007|255260001|398298007
would
be
to
perform|398166005
endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography.[15]|386718000

There
is
no reliable treatment|276239002|416118004
for cryptosporidium enteritis|83821001|64613007
;
certain agents|17162000|260872001
such as paromomycin,|38044001
atovaquone,|386899002
nitazoxanide,|407148001
[19]
and
azithromycin|387531004
are
sometimes
used|394850002
,
but
they usually
have
only temporary effects._[citation|50607009|14803004|253861007|420295001|14803004|253861007

Treatment|276239002|416118004
is
primarily supportive.

Fluids|32457005|33463005
need|410525008|103325001
to
be
replaced|282089006|370124000
orally.|260548002

A lactose-free diet|78502005|425458000
should
be
taken|419652001
as
tolerated._[citation

In rare situations,|84638005|103356009
intravenous fluids|118431008
may
be
required.

Antibiotics|255631004
are
not usually helpful,
and
are
primarily
reserved
for persons|125676002
with severe disease|24484000|64572001
and
a weak immune system.|13791008|116003000|260407003|116003000

Sometimes
relapses|263855007
happen.

The majority
of immunocompetent individuals|35194002|125676002|35194002|385435006
suffer
a short|359530003|367450005
(less
than 2 weeks|260306008|258705008
)
self-limiting course|255469002|288524001
that
requires
supportive care|243114000
with rehydration|243221009
and
occasionally antidiarrhoeal medication,|419028009|410942007
and
ends|261782000
with spontaneous recovery.|50289004

Nitazoxanide|407148001
is
one drug|421379005|410942007
that
the US FDA
has
approved|9571008
for use|277889008|419385000
in immunocompetent people to|35194002|125676002
combat
diarrhea.|398032003

Spiramycin|387163002
can

In immunocompromised individuals,|370391006|125676002|370391006|385435006
such as AIDS patients,|62479008|116154003
cryptosporidiosis|58777003
resolves
slowly|419443000
or
not
at all,
and
frequently|70232002
causes|134198009
a particularly severe|24484000
and
permanent form|6934004|246176004
of watery diarrhea|263930000|398032003
coupled
with a greatly decreased ability|1250004|371150009|260400001|371150009|260371004|371150009
to
absorb
key nutrients|226355009
through the intestinal tract.|261093006|361358007

The result|394617004
is
progressively severe dehydration,|24484000|34095006
electrolyte imbalances,|105593004
malnutrition,|248325000
wasting
,
and
eventual death.|419620001|268923008

Spiramycin|387163002
can
help
treat|395077000
diarrhea|398032003
in patients|116154003
who
are
in the early stages|264499004|261612004
of AIDS.|62479008

The mortality rate|409651001
for infected AIDS patients|62479008|116154003
is
generally
based|418836005
on CD4+ marker counts|258734002
;
patients|116154003
with CD4+ counts|258734002
over 180 cells/mm? generally|4421005
recover|74822006
with supportive hospital care|243114000|243114000|285201006
and
medication,|410942007
but
in patients|116154003
with CD4+ counts|258734002
below 50 cells/mm?,|4421005
the effects|253861007
are
usually fatal|399166001
within three|421291004
to six months.|422218008|258706009

During the Milwaukee cryptosporidiosis|58777003
epidemic
(
the largest|255509001|263768009
of its kind|261664005
)
,
73%
of AIDS patients|62479008|116154003
with CD4+
counts|258734002
lower|261122009
than 50 cells/mm?|4421005

36%
of those with counts|20401003|258734002|421463005|258734002
between 50
and
200 cells/mm?|4421005
died|419620001|419099009
within the first year|255216001|258707000|255216001|259039008|232714002|258707000|232714002|259039008
of contracting|78558002
the infection.

In one AIDS patient|421379005|62479008|116154003
from Iran,|223607008
who
had
pulmonary cryptosporidiosis|39607008|58777003|264164005|58777003
in addition|260364009
to intestinal cryptosporidiosis,|58777003
azithromycin|387531004
and
paromomycin|38044001
helped
to
clear|263707001
the infection.[21]

Currently,|15240007
the best approach
is
to
improve|385425000|3442003|385633008
the immune status
in immunodeficient individuals,|234532001|125676002|234532001|385435006
which
causes|134198009
the diarrhea to|398032003
resolve
itself
in most cases.|398241000|413769002

Biliar drainage|307488001|122462000
may
be
needed|410525008|103325001
in case|398241000
the biliary tract|34707002|181267003
is
affected.|247591002|248448006

Currently,|15240007
research
is
being
done
in molecular-based immunotherapy.|290005005|76334006|290005005|418836005|76334006

For example,
synthetic isoflavone derivates
have
been
shown
to fight|248005005
off _Cryptosporidium parvum_|51504002
in vitro
and
in a gerbil.

Derivates
of nitazoxanide,|407148001
which
are
synthetic nitro-
or
nonnitrothiazolide compounds,|62105006
have
also
shown
promising results|394617004
in vitro.[22]

Many treatment plants|260396001|276239002|31006001|260396001|416118004|31006001
that

use|277889008|419385000
conventional filtration technologies.|255333006|360166003

This
involves|248448006
a series|13039001
of processes,|415178003
including|55919000
coagulation,|129390001
flocculation,|13402008
sedimentation,
and
filtration.|360166003

Direct filtration,|255589003|360166003
which
is
typically
used|394850002
to
treat|395077000
water|11713004|119318008
with low particulate levels,|62482003|278694008|258395000|371880002|278694008|258395000
includes|55919000
coagulation|129390001
and
filtration,|360166003
but
not sedimentation.

Other common filtration processes,|74964007|72906007|360166003|415178003
including|55919000
slow sand filters,|419443000|128489003|116250002
diatomaceous earth filters|33817009|116250002
and
membranes|83097008
will
remove|127485006
99%
of _Cryptosporidium_.|83821001

Membranes|83097008
and
bag|37284003
and
cartridge filters|116250002
remove|127485006
_Cryptosporidium_ product-specifically.|83821001

While
_Cryptosporidium_|83821001
is
highly resistant|75540009|30714006
to chlorine disinfection,|29276003
[24]
with high|75540009|371879000
enough concentrations|82742001
and
contact time,|11723008|410669006|70862002|410669006
_Cryptosporidium_|83821001
will
be
inactivated
by chlorine dioxide|8785008
and
ozone treatment.|40057008|276239002|40057008|416118004

The required levels|258395000
of chlorine generally|29276003
preclude
the use|277889008|419385000
of chlorine disinfection|29276003
as a reliable method to|260686004|272394005

Ultraviolet light treatment|363695005
at relatively low doses|262459003
will
inactivate
_Cryptosporidium_.|83821001

One|421379005
of the largest challenges|255509001|263768009
in identifying outbreaks|7882003|443684005
is
the ability to|371150009
identify|7882003
_Cryptosporidium_|83821001
in the laboratory.|261904005

Real-time monitoring technology|410669006|302805002
is
now able to|371150009
detect|260373001
_Cryptosporidium_|83821001
with online systems,|246333005
unlike the spot|23840004

In the
US the law
requires
doctors|309343006
and
labs|118246004
to
report|229059009|223458004
cases|398241000|413769002
of cryptosporidiosis|58777003
to local|255470001
or
state health departments.|398070004|263775005

These departments then
report|229059009|223458004
to the Center for Disease Control|26216008|64572001|31509003
and
Prevention.|169443000

The best way to
prevent
getting
and
spreading|410677005
cryptosporidiosis|58777003
is
to
have
good hygiene|20572008|284779002
and
sanitation.

An example
would
be
hand-washing.|258154008

Prevention|169443000
is
through washing
hands|85562004
carefully
after
going
to the bathroom|223359008
or
contacting stool,|11723008|39477002
and
before eating.|236874000|48263008|421718005|48263008

People|125676002
should
avoid
contact|11723008|70862002
with animal feces.|387961004|39477002

They
should
also
avoid
possibly contaminated food|60022001|228034007
and
water.|11713004|119318008

Additionally,
people|125676002
should
refrain
from engaging|54986009
in sexual activities|365952006
that
can
expose|24932003
them
to feces.[17]|39477002

Standard water filtration|11713004|360166003|119318008|360166003

not
be
enough to
eliminate

Water|11713004|119318008
can
also
be
made
safe
by filtering|116250002|258648006
with a filter|116250002|258648006
with pore size|277049003
not greater|263768009
than 1 micrometre,|260305007|258674000

less likely to|276139006|2931005|263796003|2931005
contain|42504009
_Cryptosporidium_,|83821001
especially
if
the water|11713004|119318008
is
from an underground source.[30]|260753009

People|125676002
who
have
cryptosporidiosis|58777003
should
not
swim|20461001
in communal areas|42798000
because
the pathogen|264418008
can
reside
in the anal|53505006|263939004
and
genital areas|263767004|42798000
and
be
washed
off.

They
should
wait
until
at least two weeks|276139006|420797005|258705008|263796003|420797005|258705008

since
oocysts|103541004
can
still
be
shed
for a
while.

Also,
they
should
stay
away
from immunosuppressed people.|125676002

Immunocompromised people|370391006|125676002
should
take|419652001
care
to
protect
themselves
from water|11713004|119318008
in lakes|421084007
and
streams.|257709004

They
should
also
stay
away
from animal stools|387961004|39477002
and
wash
their hands|85562004
after touching animals.|52962008|387961004

To
be
safe,
they
should
boil|416675009
or
filter|116250002|258648006
their water.|11713004|119318008

They
should
also wash
and
cook|106373003
their vegetables.[1]|22836000

The
US CDC
notes
the recommendation
of many public health departments to|310115006
soak|42691000
contaminated surfaces|62604006|410678000
for 20 minutes|258701004|255507004|356624006
with a 3% hydrogen peroxide|260313008|387171003
(99% kill rate|248007002
)
and
then rinse
them thoroughly,
with the caveat
that
no disinfectant|311942001
is
guaranteed to
be
completely effective|255403003|254648000
against Cryptosporidium.|83821001

However,
hydrogen peroxide|387171003
is
more effective|242762006|255403003|242762006|254648000
than standard bleach solutions.[31]|76885009|8537005|264664006
