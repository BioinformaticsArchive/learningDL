(
from Greek ????|1451003
= "seal"[1]|19314006|106980009
plus ?????
(plural ?????|260396001
)
= "limb"|66019005|243996003
)
is
an extremely rare congenital disorder|84638005|66091009|103356009|66091009
involving|248448006
the limbs|66019005
(dysmelia.

?tienne Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire
coined
the term
in 1836.[2]

Although
various numbers|256220008|410680006|256220008|410681005
of factors
can
cause|23981006|134198009
phocomelia,|22841008
the prominent roots|4657009|2338009
come
from the use|277889008|419385000
of the drug thalidomide|410942007|404878004
and
from genetic inheritance.|246071007

The occurrence|272120004
of this malformation|276654001
in an individual results|125676002|394617004|385435006|394617004
in various abnormalities|256220008|276654001
to the face,|89545001|302549007
limbs,|66019005
ears,|117590005|1910005
nose,|260540009|181195007
vessels|59820001
and
many other underdevelopments.|74964007

Although
operations|83578000
can
be
done
to
fix|102491009
the abnormality|276654001
it
is
difficult|52925006
due to the lack|41277001
of nerves,|3057000
bones,|272673000|128530007
and
other related structures.|74964007|272151006|74964007|262094002

Thalidomide|404878004
was
released|68776005|129299003
into the market|284440009
in 1957
in West Germany|223637004
under the label
of Contergan.

Primarily
prescribed
as a sedative|372614000
or
hypnotic, thalidomide also|321088006|404878004
claimed
to
cure ?anxiety,|48694002|197480006
insomnia,|193462001
gastritis,|4556007
and
tension".|53489000

Afterwards
it
was
used|394850002
against nausea|422587007
and
to
alleviate
morning sickness|51885006
in pregnant women.|255409004

Thalidomide|404878004
became
an over the counter drug|80288002
in Germany|223637004
around 1960,
and
could
be
bought
without a prescription.|260885003

Shortly
after the drug|410942007
was
sold,
in Germany,|223637004
between 5,000|264706000|264605009
and
7,000 infants|418119000
were
born|106970005|81827009|398209006
with phocomelia.|22841008

Merely 40%|259031006
of these children|410601007|160499008
survived.

Research
also
proves|277025001
that
although
phocomelia|22841008
did
not
exist
through the 40?s|259031006
and
50?s,
when
thalidomide|404878004
was
released|68776005|129299003
in Germany|223637004
in the 60?s,
cases|398241000|413769002
of severe phocomelia|24484000|22841008
multiplied|421206002
;
the direct cause|255589003|134198009
was
traced|260405006
to
thalidomide.|404878004

The statistic
was
given|419582001
that ?50 percent|118582008
of the mothers|72705000
with deformed children|410601007|160499008
had
taken|419652001
thalidomide|404878004
during the first trimester|255246003
of pregnancy.?|289908002
Throughout Europe,|223502009
Australia,|223621005
and
the United States,|223688001
10,000 cases|398241000|413769002
were
reported|229059009|223458004
of infants|418119000
with phocomelia|22841008
;
only 50%|50607009|420295001
of the 10,000
survived.

Thalidomide|404878004
became
effectively
linked
to death|419620001|268923008
or
severe disabilities|24484000|21134002
among babies.|418119000

Those
subjected
to
thalidomide|404878004
while
in the womb experienced limb deficiencies|35039007|66019005|260372006|35039007|66019005|248325000|35039007|243996003|260372006|35039007|243996003|248325000|181452004|66019005|260372006|181452004|66019005|248325000|181452004|243996003|260372006|181452004|243996003|248325000
in a way
that
the long limbs|255511005|66019005
either
were
not
developed
or
presented|246105001
themselves
as
stumps.|38033009

Other effects|74964007|253861007
included|55919000
:
deformed eyes,|81745001
hearts,|80891009
alimentary,|255620007
and
urinary tracts,
and
blindness
and
deafness.[5]|343087000|8531006

A genetic disease|32895009
is
inherited|255404009
by an individual|125676002|385435006
from the genes|67271001
provided
by their mother|72705000
and
father.|66839005

Depending
upon the grouping
of these genes|67271001
for a particular trait,
determines
whether
or
not
an individual|125676002|385435006
will
inherit|255404009
a certain disease.|17162000|64572001

According to National Organization for Rare Disorders (NORD)|21139007|84638005|64572001|21139007|103356009|64572001
:
when
phocomelia|22841008
is
transmitted [|60117003|258150004
in its familial genetic form]|35359004|3950001|246176004|35359004|255395001|246176004|255401001|3950001|246176004|255401001|255395001|246176004
it
is
seen
as an autosomal recessive trait|258211005
and
the mutation|55446002
is
linked
to chromosome 8[6]|45202000

Recessive genetic disorders|32895009
occur|272120004
when
a person|125676002
receives
identical ?abnormal genes?|20323000|263654008|67271001
from both
the father|66839005
and
mother.|72705000

If
a person|125676002
inherits|255404009
one normal gene|421379005|17621005|67271001|421379005|258744000|67271001
and
one gene|421379005|67271001
for the disease,|64572001
the individual|125676002|385435006
will
become
a carrier|47461006|29679002
for the disease|64572001
;
however,
they normally
do
not
show
symptoms.

The chance
for two carrier parents|420797005|47461006|40683002|420797005|29679002|40683002
to
both
supply|425398004
the defective gene|67271001
and
produce
a child|410601007|160499008
with symptoms
is
25 percent|118582008
with each pregnancy.[6]|289908002

During normal cell division,|4421005|118630004|118957004|118630004
each chromosome|91272006
is
replicated|1305003
and
the original chromosome|19535007|91272006
is
attached|102491009
to the new copy.|7147002

Although
there
are
several attachment|261028005|1431002
points
in a chromosome,|91272006
the centromere|70187007
is
the major connection point|255603008|263538003
and
where the immensity
of the work|261041009
generates.

The chromosomes? connection|91272006|263538003
allows
the cells to|4421005
join
together?making
sure
that
the two copies|420797005
are ?
lined|50009006
up together
at the center|26216008
of the dividing cell.?|35853008
Once the chromosomes|91272006
are
aligned
,
tiny molecular spindles attach|290005005|102491009
to each copy
and
then pull away|303370007
the ?original|19535007
and
new copy?|7147002
as the division|118630004
continues.|255238004

An individual containing phocomelia|125676002|42504009|22841008|385435006|42504009|22841008
will
have
chromosome|91272006
copies
that
do
not
connect
at the centromeres,|70187007
making
them unable|371151008
to line up accordingly.|50009006|255532002|50009006|353734004

As a result,|394617004
the cell|4421005|362837007
becomes
incapable
of division|118630004
or
slow|419443000
in the process|415178003
;
because of this
the newly made cells|4421005
contain|42504009
an excessive|260378005
or
reduced amount|260400001|107651007
of chromosomes.|91272006

In phocomelia|22841008
the cells|4421005
cease
to
develop
,
or
die|419620001|399069006|419099009
,
preventing|116699007
proper development|278923009
of the limbs,|66019005
eyes,|81745001
brain,|12738006|258335003
palate,|261145003|181227004
or
other structures.[7]|74964007

Typically
the symptoms
of phocomelia syndrome|22841008
are
undeveloped limbs|66019005
and
absent pelvic bones|2667000|28254004|2667000|46633002
;
however,
various abnormalities|256220008|276654001
can
occur|272120004
to the limbs|66019005
and
bones.|272673000|128530007

Usually
the upper limbs|53120007
are
not fully
formed|35810008
and
sections|62083003|118630004
of the ?hands|85562004
and
arms|40983000
may
be
missing.?
Short arm bones,|249739008|272673000|249739008|128530007
fused fingers,|2560006
and
missing thumbs|76505004
will
often|70232002
occur.|272120004

Legs|30021000
and
feet|56459004|259051005
are
also
affected|247591002|248448006
similarly
to the arms|40983000
and
hands.|85562004

Individuals|125676002|385435006
with phocomelia|22841008
will
often|70232002
lack|41277001
thigh bones,|421235005
and
the hands|85562004
or
feet|56459004|259051005
may
be
abnormally small|255507004
or
appear
as stumps|38033009
due to their close ?attachment|29179001|1431002
to the body.?[6]|279495008|123037004
According to NORD,
individuals|125676002|385435006
carrying|288345009
phocomelia syndrome|22841008
will
generally
show
symptoms
of growth retardation|444896005
previous to
and
after birth.|237679004|3950001|288563008|3950001

The syndrome
can
also
cause|23981006|134198009
mental deficiencies|260372006|248325000
in infants.|418119000

Infants|418119000
born|106970005|81827009|398209006
with phocomelia|22841008
will
normally
have
a petite head|69536005|302548004
with ?sparse hair?|386045008|119326000
that
may
appear ?silvery-blonde.?|41967008|371257001|406951002
Hemangioma,|400210000
the abnormal buildup|263654008
of blood vessels,|59820001
will
possibly|60022001
develop
around the facial area|89545001|42798000
at birth|3950001
and
the eyes|81745001
may
be
set
widely apart,
a condition|260905004
known|36692007
as orbital hypertelorism.|194021007

The pigment|65863008
of the eyes|81745001
will
be
a bluish white.|413773004|185984009|371251000

Phocomelia|22841008
can
also
cause|23981006|134198009
:
an undeveloped nose|260540009|181195007
with slender nostrils,|1797002
disfigured ears,|117590005|1910005
irregularly petite jaws [also|661005
known|36692007
as micrognathia],|32958008
and
a cleft lip|80281008
with cleft palate.|253986002

According to NORD,
severe symptoms|162470006
of phocomelia|22841008
include|55919000
:

When
an individual|125676002|385435006
is
born|106970005|81827009|398209006
with phocomelia|22841008
due to drugs|410942007
or
pharmaceuticals,|421967003
it
is
known|36692007
as thalidomide syndrome.|404878004

The symptoms
of thalidomide syndrome|404878004
are
defined
by absent|2667000
or
shortened limbs|359530003|66019005
;
causing flipper hands|23981006|85562004
and
feet.|56459004|259051005

According to Anthony J Perri III,|257471003
and
Sylvia Hsu|447369008
they
can
additionally
receive
:

The infants|418119000
that
were
exposed|24932003
to
thalidomide|404878004
during development phases|278923009|272108007
have
a 40% chance|259031006
of survival.

The McMredie-McBride hypothesis
explains
that
the limbs|66019005
of the infants|418119000
become
malformed
as a result|394617004
of the thalidomide harming|404878004
the neural tissue?simply|91728009|110657001
because
the neural tissue|91728009|110657001
has
such a large impact|255509001|134293005
on formation|11798007|255277001
and
development|278923009
of the limbs.[10]|66019005

Prosthesis|53350007|118663006
is
a synthetic alternative
for missing limbs,|66019005
teeth,|38199008
and
various other body parts.|256220008|38866009

Advances|86005002
in prosthetic limbs|66019005
have
increased|35105006|260366006
greatly
during the twentieth century.

The use|277889008|419385000
of new materials|7147002|260769002
such as modern plastics,|61088005
complex procedures|118439005
and
better pigments|3442003|65863008
have
created
lighter|75926004
in weight|27113001|272102008|39857003
and
more realistic looking artificial limbs.|242762006|386548000|74444006

With the advancement|129352007
of myoelectric prosthetic limbs,|66019005
patients|116154003
are
able to|371150009
move|302000008|384598002|370125004
their limbs|66019005
without the use|277889008|419385000
of cords
or
other devices.|74964007|303607000|74964007|49062001

The myoelectric limbs|66019005
can
detect|260373001
electric signals|18213006
from the nervous system|25087005|278196006
and
muscles.|91727004

They
were
first|255216001|232714002
used|394850002
on adults,|133936004
but
now
they
are
being
fitted|91175000|102499006
to children.|410601007|160499008

Patients|116154003
that
receive
a loss
of limbs|66019005
due to phocomelia|22841008
are
typically
treated|28995006
with prosthetics.

Infants|418119000
at the age|424144002
of 6 months|258706009
are
recommended
to
have
a prosthetic mitten|47776004
fitted|91175000|102499006
;
enabling|225791005
them to
get
used|394850002
to the prosthesis.|53350007|118663006

A hook|260883005
will
be
added
when
the child|410601007|160499008
reaches|282679008
the age|424144002
of 2 years.|260306008|258707000

Eventually
the patient|116154003
may
receive
a myoelectric prosthetic limb.|66019005|243996003

Patients|116154003
are
treated|28995006
in this way
due to the lack|41277001
of understanding|66216009
at a young age|84422007|424144002
and
the absence|2667000|418560003
of necessary tissues|85756007
and
bones to|272673000|128530007
hold|421139008
the prosthetic limb.|66019005|243996003
