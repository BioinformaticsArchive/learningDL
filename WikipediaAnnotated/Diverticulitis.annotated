*Diverticulitis|307496006
*
*
is
a common digestive disease particularly|72906007|53619000
found|404684003
in the large intestine.|14742008|181254001

Diverticulitis|307496006
develops
from diverticulosis,|63532004
which
involves|248448006
the formation|11798007|255277001
of pouches
(diverticula|31113003
on the outside of the colon.|261074009|263977005|261074009|302508007

Diverticulitis|307496006
results|394617004
if one|421379005
of these diverticula|31113003
becomes
inflamed.

Patients often|116154003|70232002
present|52101004|246105001
with the classic triad|255301002|255333006
of left lower quadrant pain,|301716002
fever,|386661006
and
leukocytosis|414478003
(
an elevation|103720008|255456001
of the white cell count|413773004|118218001|185984009|118218001|371251000|118218001
in blood tests|252275004
).

Patients|116154003
may
also
complain
of nausea|422587007
or
diarrhea|398032003
;
others|74964007
may
be
constipated.|14760008

Less commonly,|276139006|263796003
an individual|125676002|385435006
with diverticulitis|307496006
may
present|52101004|246105001
with right-sided abdominal pain.|285388000

This
may
be
due to the less prevalent right-sided diverticula|276139006|24028007|31113003|276139006|264180000|31113003|263796003|24028007|31113003|263796003|264180000|31113003
or
a very redundant sigmoid colon.|260358002|160901009|60184004|260358002|60184004

Some patients|116154003
report|229059009|223458004
bleeding|131148009
from the rectum.|34402009|181261002

The most common symptom|4757001|72906007
of diverticulitis|307496006
is
abdominal pain.|21522001

The most common sign|4757001|72906007|72670004
is
tenderness|247348008
around the left side|7771000
of the lower abdomen.|27033000

If infection
is
the cause,|134198009
then nausea,|422587007
vomiting|249497008
,
fever,|386661006
cramping,|55300003|410709000
and
constipation|14760008
may
occur|272120004
as well.|20572008

The severity|272141005
of symptoms
depends
on the extent|255590007
of the infection
and
complications.|116223007

Diverticulitis|307496006
may
worsen|230993007|390772001
throughout the first day,|255216001|258703001|255216001|259032004|232714002|258703001|232714002|259032004
as
it
starts|255395001|385652002
as small pains|255507004|22253000
and/or
diarrhea,|398032003
and
may
slowly|419443000
turn|282987006
into vomiting|249497008
and
sharp pains._[citation|8708008

Most people|125676002
with diverticulosis|63532004
do
not
have
any discomfort|367391008|87128005
or
symptoms
;
however,
symptoms
may
include|55919000
mild cramps,|255604002|55300003
bloating|248490000
,
and
constipation.|14760008

Other diseases|74964007|64572001
such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)|24526004
and
stomach ulcers|397825006
cause|23981006|134198009
similar problems,|55607006
so
these symptoms
do
not always
mean|255586005
a person|125676002
has
diverticulosis.|63532004

The development|278923009
of colonic diverticulum|263977005|31113003
is
thought to|88952004
be
a result|394617004
of raised intraluminal colonic pressures.|260399008|264045001|263977005|279046003|260399008|264045001|263977005|13543005

The sigmoid colon|60184004
(Section 4|62083003|118630004
)
has
the smallest diameter|263796003|81827009|255507004|81827009
of any portion|260726005
of the colon,|263977005|302508007
and
therefore
the portion|260726005
which
would
be
expected
to
have
the highest intraluminal pressure.|75540009|264045001|279046003|75540009|264045001|13543005|75540009|264045001|257893003|371879000|264045001|279046003|371879000|264045001|13543005|371879000|264045001|257893003

The claim
that
a lack|41277001
of dietary fiber,|116272000
particularly non-soluble fiber|116272000|400293002|87028007|37202001
(also
known|36692007
in older parlance|70753007
as "roughage"
)
predisposes
individuals|125676002|385435006
to diverticular disease|63532004
was
long|255511005
accepted|385645004
within the medical literature.|74188005

However,
the
first
study|110465008|224699009
to specifically
test|269814003|272393004
the theory
has
found|404684003
that "_
A high-fiber diet|11739001
and
increased frequency|35105006|260864003|35105006|272123002|260366006|260864003|260366006|272123002
of bowel movements|111989001
are
associated|47429007
with greater,|263768009
rather than
lower, prevalence|261122009
of diverticulosis_."[3]|63532004

Foods|255620007
such as seeds,|264337003
nuts,|13577000
and
corn|2911006|46014006|2447002|412357001
were
,
in the past,|410513005
thought|88952004
by many health care professionals
to possibly|60022001
aggravate|162473008
diverticulitis.|307496006

However,
recent studies|6493001|110465008|6493001|224699009
have
found|404684003
no evidence|18669006
that
suggests
the avoidance
of nuts|13577000
and
seeds|264337003
prevents|116699007
the progression|246453008|246450006
of diverticulosis|63532004
to an acute case|272118002|398241000
of diverticulitis.|307496006

Not only
has
this research
shown
that
they
do
not
appear
to
be
aggravating|162473008
the diverticulitis,|307496006
but
it
appears
that
a higher intake|75540009|371879000
of nuts|13577000
and
corn|2911006|46014006|2447002|412357001
could
in fact
help
to
avoid
diverticulitis|307496006
in male adults.[5]|248153007|133936004

People|125676002
with the above symptoms|261183002
are
commonly
studied|110465008|224699009
with a computed tomography,|77477000
or
CT scan.|77477000

The CT scan|77477000
is
very accurate|260358002|263656005
(98%
)
in diagnosing diverticulitis.|439401001|307496006

In order to
extract|62972009
the most information|4757001
possible|371930009|60022001
about the patient's condition,|116154003|260905004
thin section|18043004|62083003|18043004|118630004
(5mm
)
transverse images|62824007|243899009
are
obtained|398092000
through the entire abdomen|302553009
and
pelvis|277113001|21844003|229765004
after the patient|116154003
has
been
administered oral|418283001|260548002
and
intravascular contrast.|261101003

Images
reveal|263857004
localized colon wall thickening,|255471002|263977005|224727009|263899003|255471002|302508007|224727009|263899003
with inflammation extending|257552002|255590007
into the fat|271590003
surrounding|355648006
the colon.|263977005|302508007

[7]
The diagnosis|439401001
of acute diverticulitis|272118002|307496006
is
made confidently
when
the involved segment|248448006|264193005
contains|42504009
diverticulae.

CT
may
also
identify|7882003
patients|116154003
with more complicated diverticulitis,|242762006|255302009|307496006
such as those with an associated abscess.|20401003|47429007|128477000|421463005|47429007|128477000

It
may
even
allow
for radiologically guided drainage|106384005|307488001|106384005|122462000|303479009|307488001|303479009|122462000
of an associated abscess,|47429007|128477000
sparing
a patient|116154003
from immediate surgical intervention.|88694003|83578000|49499008|83578000

Other studies,|74964007|110465008|74964007|224699009
such as barium enema|265068003
and
colonoscopy|73761001
are
contraindicated|410536001
in the acute phase|255251009
of diverticulitis|307496006
due to the risk|30207005
of perforation.|263837003

The differential diagnosis|47965005
includes|55919000
colon cancer,|363406005|269533000
inflammatory bowel disease,|24526004
ischemic colitis,|30588004
and
irritable bowel syndrome,|10743008
as well as
a number|410680006|410681005
of urological
and
gynecological processes.|394586005|415178003

Most cases|398241000|413769002
of simple, uncomplicated diverticulitis|13673007|263914008|307496006
respond
to conservative therapy|281131004
with bowel rest|261093006|258157001
and
antibiotics.|255631004

Despite
being
recommended
by several guidelines,|261028005
the use|277889008|419385000
of antibiotics|255631004
in mild cases|255604002|398241000|255604002|413769002
of uncomplicated diverticulitis|263914008|307496006
is
supported|9096001|243114000
with only "sparse|50607009|420295001
and
of low quality" evidence,|62482003|263496004|18669006|371880002|263496004|18669006
with no evidence supporting|18669006|9096001|18669006|243114000
their routine use.|50811001|277889008|50811001|419385000

However,
recurring|246455001|255227004
acute attacks|272118002|216299002
or
complications,|116223007
such as peritonitis,|48661000
abscess,|128477000
or
fistula|428794004|418743005
may
require
surgery,|83578000
either
immediately|49499008
or
on an elective basis.|103390000|103390000|418836005

People|125676002
may
be
placed|257557008|421066005
on a low residue diet.|160675002

This low-fiber diet|15108003
gives|419582001
the colon adequate time|263977005|51117008|410669006|263977005|88323005|410669006|302508007|51117008|410669006|302508007|88323005|410669006
to heal|298005009
without needing to|103325001
be
overworked.|105490003

Later,
patients|116154003
are
placed|257557008|421066005
on a high-fiber diet.|11739001

Diverticulitis surgery|307496006|83578000
may
be
elective|103390000
or
may
be
a medical emergency.|74188005|25876001

Whether
the elective surgery|274075007
should
be
performed|398166005
is
decided
by external factors|261074009
such as the stage|21191007|371508000|261612004
of the disease,|64572001
the age|424144002
of the patient|116154003
and
his
or
her general medical condition,|60132005|74188005|260905004
as well as
the severity|272141005
and
frequency|260864003|272123002
of attacks|216299002
or
if
the symptoms
persisted
after a first acute episode.|255217005|272118002

In most cases,|398241000|413769002
the decision to
perform|398166005
elective surgery|274075007
is
taken|419652001
when
the risks|30207005
of the surgery|83578000
are
smaller|263796003|255507004
than the ones|421379005
resulted|42752001|394617004
from the complication|116223007|263718001
of the condition.|260905004

Elective surgery|274075007
may
be
performed|398166005
at least six weeks|276139006|422218008|258705008|263796003|422218008|258705008
after recovery
from acute diverticulitis.[12]|272118002|307496006

Emergency surgery|25876001|83578000
is
necessary
for people|125676002
whose intestine|261093006
has
ruptured|415747007|263862003
;
intestinal rupture always|261093006|415747007
results|394617004
in infection
of the abdominal cavity.|52731004|361294009

During emergency diverticulitis surgery,|25876001|307496006|83578000
the ruptured section|415747007|62083003|415747007|118630004|263862003|62083003|263862003|118630004
is
removed|127485006
and
a colostomy|398740003|418162004
is
performed.|398166005

This means|255586005
that
the surgeon|304292004
will
create
an opening|56116003
between the large intestine|14742008|181254001
and
the surface|410678000
of the skin.|119325001|39937001|181469002

The colostomy|398740003|418162004
is
closed|29179001
in about 10
or
12 weeks|258705008
in a subsequent surgery|255260001|83578000
in which
the cut|283396008
ends|261782000
of the intestine|261093006
are
rejoined.

The first surgical approach|255216001|424876005|232714002|424876005
consists
in the resection|118292001|128303001
and
primary anastomosis.|63161005|41796003|63161005|257741005|261424001|41796003|261424001|257741005

This first stage|258215001
of surgery|83578000
is
performed|398166005
on patients|116154003
with a well|20572008
vascularized,|255451006
nonedematous
and
tension-free bowel.|53489000|37837009|261093006

The proximal margin|40415009|112233002|40415009|82868003|40415009|372249001
should
be
an area|42798000
of pliable colon|263977005|302508007
without hypertrophy|56246009
or
inflammation.|257552002

The distal margin|46053002|112233002|46053002|82868003|46053002|372249001
should
extend|255590007
to the upper third|264253003
of the rectum|34402009|181261002
where the taenia coalesces.|28625000

Not
all
of the diverticula-bearing colon|31113003|106970005|263977005|31113003|106970005|302508007|31113003|81827009|263977005|31113003|81827009|302508007|31113003|398209006|263977005|31113003|398209006|302508007
must
be
removed|127485006
,
since
diverticula|31113003
proximal|40415009
to the descending|75294000
or
sigmoid colon|60184004
are
unlikely to
result|394617004
in further symptoms.[14]|46053002

Diverticulitis surgery|307496006|83578000
can
be
done
in two ways|420797005
:
through a primary bowel resection|63161005|261093006|118292001|63161005|261093006|128303001|261424001|261093006|118292001|261424001|261093006|128303001
or
through a bowel resection|261093006|118292001|261093006|128303001
with colostomy.|398740003|418162004

Both
bowel resections|261093006|118292001
may
be
done
in the traditional way|263901007
or
by laparoscopic surgery.|108191006|83578000|83578000

The traditional bowel resection|263901007|261093006|118292001|263901007|261093006|128303001
is
made
using|260676000
an open surgical approach,|129236007|83578000|56116003|424876005
called colectomy.|23968004

During a colectomy,|23968004
the patient|116154003
is
placed|257557008|421066005
under general anesthesia.|50697003

A surgeon|304292004
performing|398166005
a colectomy|23968004
will
make
a lower midline incision|261122009|276917008
in the abdomen|277112006|52731004|302553009
or
a lateral|49370004
lower|261122009
transverse incision.|359667002

The diseased section|64572001|62083003|64572001|118630004
of the large intestine|14742008|181254001
is
removed|127485006
and
then
the two healthy ends|420797005|263775005|261782000
are
sewn
or
stapled|50015006|122868007
back together.

A colostomy|398740003|418162004
may
be
performed|398166005
when
the bowel|261093006
has
to
be
relieved|398004007
of its normal digestive work|17621005|106079008|261041009|17621005|86762007|261041009|258744000|106079008|261041009|258744000|86762007|261041009
as
it heals.|298005009

A colostomy|398740003|418162004
implies
creating
a temporary opening|14803004|56116003
of the colon|263977005|302508007
on the skin surface|119325001|410678000|39937001|410678000|181469002|410678000
and
the end|261782000|422117008
of the colon|263977005|302508007
is
passed
through the abdominal wall|83908009|181613000
and
a removable bag|37284003
is
attached|102491009
to it.

The waste
will
be
collected
in the bag.[16]|37284003

However,
most
of the surgeons|304292004
prefer|225773000
performing|398166005
the bowel resection laparoscopically mainly|261093006|118292001|261093006|128303001
because
the postoperative pain|213299007
is
reduced|260400001
and
the patient's recovery|116154003
is
faster.|16985007|277748003

The laparoscopic surgery|108191006|83578000|83578000
is
a minimally invasive procedure|441788009
in which three to four smaller incisions|421291004|421534005|263796003|34896006|421291004|421534005|255507004|34896006
are
made
in the abdomen|277112006|52731004|302553009
or
navel.|78220002

All colon surgery|82874003
involves|248448006
only three maneuvers|50607009|421291004|420295001|421291004
that
may
vary
in complexity|103360007
depending
on the region|410673009
of the bowel|261093006
and
the nature|277302009
of the disease|64572001
which
are
the retraction|37794007
of the colon,|263977005|302508007
the division|118630004
of the attachments|1431002
to the colon|263977005|302508007
and
the dissection|122459003
of the mesentery.|261130005

After the resection|118292001|128303001
of the colon,|263977005|302508007
the surgeon normally|304292004
divides|422033008
the attachments|1431002
to the liver|10200004|181268008
and
the small intestine.|264196002|181250005

After the mesenteric vessels|261130005|59820001
are
dissected|75508005
,
the colon|263977005|302508007
is
divided|422033008
with special surgical staplers|67995009|83578000|262176006
that
close|29179001
off the bowel|261093006
while
cutting|70302008|410717008
between the staple lines.|386014009|50009006

The primary bowel resection|63161005|261093006|118292001|63161005|261093006|128303001|261424001|261093006|118292001|261424001|261093006|128303001
is
the standard procedure|71388002
for diverticulitis.|307496006

It
consists
of the removal|118292001|128303001
of the diseased|64572001
or
ruptured part|415747007|260726005|263862003|260726005
of the intestine|261093006
which
is
then
reconnected
to healthy segments|263775005|264193005
of the colon.|263977005|302508007

This
is
called anastomosis.|41796003|257741005

Depending
on the patient's general medical condition,|116154003|60132005|74188005|260905004
the procedure|71388002
may
be
done
traditionally,
via a colectomy,|23968004
or
laparoscopically,
which
requires
smaller incisions|263796003|34896006|255507004|34896006
and
allows
for faster recovery.[18]|16985007|277748003

When
excessive inflammation|260378005|257552002
of the colon|263977005|302508007
renders
primary bowel resection too risky,|63161005|261093006|118292001|30207005|63161005|261093006|128303001|30207005|261424001|261093006|118292001|30207005|261424001|261093006|128303001|30207005
bowel resection|261093006|118292001|261093006|128303001
with colostomy|398740003|418162004
remains
an option.

Also
known|36692007
as the Hartmann's operation,|83578000
this
is
a more complicated surgery typically|242762006|255302009|83578000
reserved
for life-threatening cases.|224130005|398241000|224130005|413769002

The bowel resection|261093006|118292001|261093006|128303001
with colostomy|398740003|418162004
implies
a temporary colostomy|386829005
which
is
followed|367409002
by a second operation|81170007|83578000|257997001|83578000|288495006|83578000
which
has
the purpose to|363675004
reverse
the colostomy.|398740003|418162004

The surgeon|304292004
makes
an opening|56116003
in the abdominal wall|83908009|181613000
(
a colostomy|398740003|418162004
)
which
helps
clearing
the infection
and
inflammation.|257552002

The colon|263977005|302508007
is
brought out|68369002
through the opening|56116003
and
all waste
is
collected
into an external bag.[19]|261074009|37284003

The colostomy|398740003|418162004
is
usually temporary|14803004
but
it
may
be
permanent|6934004
depending
on the severity|272141005
of the case.|398241000

Most
of the time,|410669006
several months|261028005|258706009
later|260383002
after the inflammation|257552002
has
healed|90910008
,
the patient|116154003
undergoes
another major surgery|255603008|83578000
during which
the surgeon|304292004
rejoins
the colon|263977005|302508007
and
rectum|34402009|181261002
and
reverses
the colostomy.|398740003|418162004

In complicated diverticulitis,|255302009|307496006
bacteria|409822003
may
subsequently
infect
the
outside of the colon|263977005|302508007
if
an inflamed diverticulum|31113003
bursts|255331008
open.|56116003

If
the infection
spreads|410677005
to the lining|50009006
of the abdominal cavity,|52731004|361294009
(peritoneum,|15425007
this
can
cause|23981006|134198009
a potentially fatal peritonitis.|399166001|48661000

Sometimes
inflamed
diverticula|31113003
can
cause|23981006|134198009
narrowing|25659002|134223000
of the bowel,|261093006
leading|236874000
to an obstruction.|26036001

Also,
the affected part|247591002|260726005|248448006|260726005
of the colon|263977005|302508007
could
adhere|102491009
to the bladder|89837001|302512001
or
other organ|74964007|410653004
in the pelvic cavity,|21844003|281903009
causing|23981006
a fistula,|428794004|418743005
or
abnormal connection|263654008|263538003
between an organ|410653004
and
adjacent structure|18769003
or
organ,|410653004
in this case|398241000
the colon|263977005|302508007
and
an adjacent organ.|18769003|410653004

Diverticulitis most often|307496006|70232002
affects|4065008
middle-aged|28288005
and
elderly persons,|105436006
though
it
can
strike|89098005
younger patients|84422007|116154003
as well.|20572008

Central obesity|248311001
may
be
associated|47429007
with diverticulitis|307496006
in younger patients,|84422007|116154003
with some
being
as young|84422007
as 20 years old.[22]|258707000|70753007

In Western countries,|223369002
diverticular disease most commonly|63532004
involves|248448006
the sigmoid colon - section 4 -|60184004|62083003|60184004|118630004
(95%
of patients|116154003
).

The prevalence
of diverticular disease|63532004
has
increased|35105006|260366006
from an estimated 10%|414135002
in the 1920s
to
between 35
and
50%
by the late 1960s.|260383002

65%|264695004
of those currently 85 years|15240007|258707000
of age|424144002
and
older|70753007
can
be
expected
to
have
some form|246176004
of diverticular disease|63532004
of the colon.|263977005|302508007

Less
than 5%|264706000|264605009
of those aged 40 years|424144002|259031006|258707000|105436006|259031006|258707000
and
younger|84422007
may
also
be
affected|247591002|248448006
by diverticular disease.|63532004

Left-sided diverticular disease|7771000|63532004|263795004|63532004
(
involving|248448006
the sigmoid colon|60184004
)
is
most common|4757001|72906007
in the West,
while
right-sided diverticular disease|24028007|63532004|264180000|63532004
is
more prevalent|242762006
in Asia|223500001
and
Africa.|223498002

Among patients|116154003
with diverticulosis,|63532004
10?25% patients|116154003
will
go
on to
develop
diverticulitis|307496006
within their lifetimes.
