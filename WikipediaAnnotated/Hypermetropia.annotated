as
*
*farsightedness|38101003
*
*,
*
*longsightedness|38101003
*
*
or

is
a defect|6920004
of vision|281004000
caused|23981006|134198009
by an imperfection
in the eye|81745001|244486005
(often|70232002
when
the eyeball|81745001
is
too short|359530003|367450005
or
the lens|78076003|181169005
cannot
become
round enough|42700002
)
,
causing|23981006
difficulty focusing|55891002
on near objects,|277752003|260787004
and
in extreme cases|12565001|398241000|12565001|413769002
causing|23981006
a sufferer to
be
unable|371151008
to focus|87017008|363702006
on objects|260787004
at any distance.|246132006

As an object|260787004
moves|302000008
toward the eye,|81745001|244486005
the eye|81745001|244486005
must
increase|260366006
its optical power to|281004000|33300005
keep
the image
in focus|87017008|363702006
on the retina.|5665001|181171005

If
the power|33300005
of the cornea|28726007|181162001
and
lens|78076003|181169005
is
insufficient,|71978007|423437008
as
in hyperopia,|38101003
the image
will
appear
blurred.|246636008

People|125676002
with hyperopia|38101003
can
experience
blurred vision,|246636008
asthenopia,|70323002
accommodative dysfunction#Accommodative_dysfunction|251776000|386585008
)
,
binocular dysfunction,|386585008
amblyopia,|387742006
and
strabismus.[1]|22066006

Hyperopia|38101003
is
often|70232002
confused|286933003
with presbyopia,|41256004
[2][3]|260306008
another condition|260905004
that frequently|70232002
causes|134198009
blurry
near vision.|281004000

Presbyopes
who
report|229059009|223458004
good far vision typically|20572008|46053002|281004000
experience
blurry
near vision|281004000
because of a reduced accommodative amplitude|260400001|419862005
brought|68369002
about
by natural aging changes|510009|248280005|243326001|510009|248280005|263703002
with the crystalline lens.|78076003

It
is
also sometimes
referred|439980006
to
as
farsightedness,|38101003
since
in otherwise normally-sighted persons|281004000|125676002
it
makes
it more difficult|242762006|52925006
to focus|87017008|363702006
on near objects|277752003|260787004
than
on far objects.[5]|46053002|260787004

The causes|134198009
of hyperopia|38101003
are
typically genetic|3950001|255395001
and
involve|248448006
an eye|81745001|244486005
that
is
too short|359530003|367450005
or
a cornea|28726007|181162001
that
is
too flat,|6041008|257564005
so
that images focus|87017008|363702006
at a point
behind the retina.|5665001|181171005

Hyperopia|38101003
is
typically
classified|73504009
according to clinical appearance,|58147004|386548000|58147004|255412001
its severity,|272141005
or
how
it
relates|272151006|262094002
to the eye's accommodative status.[1]|251776000|263490005|81745001|224209007|244486005|224209007

Hyperopia|38101003
can
be
caused|23981006|134198009
by sinus infections,|36971009
injuries,
migraines,|37796009
aging|248280005
or
genetics.

Visual acuity|363983007
is
affected|247591002|248448006
according to the amount|107651007
of hyperopia,|38101003
as well as
the patient's age,|116154003|424144002
visual demands,|255374006
and
accommodative ability.[1]|251776000|371150009

In severe cases|24484000|398241000|24484000|413769002
of hyperopia|38101003
from birth,|3950001
the brain|12738006|258335003
has
difficulty|371157007
merging
the images
that
each individual eye sees.|125676002|81745001|281004000|125676002|244486005|281004000|385435006|81745001|281004000|385435006|244486005|281004000

This
is
because
the images
the brain|12738006|258335003
receives
from each eye|81745001|244486005
are
always
blurred.|246636008

A child|410601007|160499008
with severe hyperopia|24484000|38101003
has
never
seen
objects|260787004
in detail
and
might
present|52101004|246105001
with amblyopia|387742006
or
strabismus.|22066006

If
the brain never|12738006|258335003
learns|69998004
to
see|281004000
objects|260787004
in detail,
then there
is
a high chance|75540009|371879000
that one eye|421379005|81745001|421379005|244486005
will
become
dominant.

The result|394617004
is
that
the brain|12738006|258335003
will
block|26036001|112232007
the impulses|263781002
of the nondominant eye|81745001|244486005
with resulting amblyopia|42752001|387742006
or
strabismus.|22066006

In contrast,
the child|410601007|160499008
with myopia|57190000
can
see|281004000
objects|260787004
close|29179001
to the eye|81745001|244486005
in detail
and
does
learn|69998004
at an early age to|264499004|424144002
see|281004000
detail
in objects.|260787004

The child|410601007|160499008
with hyperopia|38101003
will
typically
stand|282972001
close|29179001
in front|255549009
of a television.|255712000

One|421379005
would
have
expected
that
the child|410601007|160499008
would
stand|282972001
far away|46053002
because
the child|410601007|160499008
is
hyperopic,|38101003
but
because
the brain|12738006|258335003
has
never
learned|69998004
to
see|281004000
detailed lines|50009006
and
object contours|260787004
the child sees|410601007|281004000|160499008|281004000
objects|260787004
blurred.|246636008

While
children|410601007|160499008
with myopia|57190000
learn|69998004
to
see|281004000
sharp lines|410707003|50009006
because
they
can
see|281004000
perfectly well very|20572008|260358002
close|29179001
to their eyes,|81745001
the brain|12738006|258335003
of a child|410601007|160499008
with hyperopia|38101003
cannot
see|281004000
sharp lines,|410707003|50009006
so
they
stand|282972001
right|24028007
in front|255549009
of the television|255712000
to
at least
see|281004000
blurred images.|246636008

This blurred vision|246636008
may
also
cause|23981006|134198009
a child to|410601007|160499008
develop
a squint|22066006
because
the two eyes|420797005|81745001
do
not
detect|260373001
sharp lines|410707003|50009006
which the brain|12738006|258335003
can
use|277889008|419385000
to
map|360220002
the separate images|263869007
of the two eyes together to|420797005|81745001
form|246176004
a single image.|125681006|50607009

Each eye|81745001|244486005
functions|246464006
independently.

So
a child|410601007|160499008
with hyperopia|38101003
from birth|3950001
presents|52101004|246105001
with decreased visual perception.|1250004|281004000|1250004|311886005|260400001|281004000|260400001|311886005|260371004|281004000|260371004|311886005

The parents|40683002
of a child|410601007|160499008
with hyperopia|38101003
do
not always
realize
that
the child|410601007|160499008
has
a problem|55607006
at an early age.|264499004|424144002

A hyperopic child|38101003|410601007|38101003|160499008
might
have
problems|55607006
with catching|30623001
a ball
because of blurred vision|246636008
and
because of a decreased ability to|1250004|371150009|260400001|371150009|260371004|371150009
see|281004000
three-dimensional objects.|264672008|260787004

The child|410601007|160499008
will
typically
perform|398166005
below average
at school.|257698009

As soon
as a child|410601007|160499008
starts|255395001|385652002
identifying images,|7882003
a parent|40683002
might
find
that
the child|410601007|160499008
cannot
see|281004000
small objects|255507004|260787004
or
pictures.|257445002

Various eye care professionals,|256220008|225363004
including|55919000
ophthalmologists,|422234006
optometrists,|28229004
orthoptists,|159027001
and
opticians,|387619007
are
involved|248448006
in the treatment|276239002|416118004
and
management|413454004|119270007
of hyperopia.|38101003

At the conclusion
of an eye examination,|36228007
an eye doctor|81745001|309343006|244486005|309343006
may
provide
the patient|116154003
with an eyeglass prescription|183131009
for corrective lenses.|78076003|181169005

Minor amounts|410599005|107651007|255606000|107651007
of hyperopia|38101003
are
sometimes
left|7771000
uncorrected.

However,
larger amounts|255509001|107651007|263768009|107651007
may
be
corrected|370975003
with convex lenses#Types_|78076003|261664005|181169005|261664005
of_simple_lenses|13673007|78076003|13673007|181169005
)
in eyeglasses|50121007
or
contact lenses.|57368009

Convex lenses|78076003|181169005
have
a positive dioptric value,|258758003|10828004
which
causes|134198009
the light|56242006|371268001
to focus|87017008|363702006
closer|29179001
than its normal range.|260395002

Hyperopia|38101003
is
sometimes
correctable
with various refractive surgery procedures|256220008|373391005
(LASIK.|312965008

It
can
also
be
corrected|370975003
with special convex lenses.|67995009|78076003|67995009|181169005
