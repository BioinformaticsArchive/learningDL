*hemangioma|400210000

is
a benign,|30807003
and
usually
a self-
involuting
tumor,|108369006
(swelling|423666004|442672001
or
growth
)
of the endothelial cells|45709008
that line blood vessels|50009006|59820001
and
is
characterised
by increased number|35105006|410680006|35105006|410681005|260366006|410680006|260366006|410681005
of normal|17621005|258744000
or
abnormal vessels|263654008|59820001
filled
with blood.|87612001|119273009

It usually
appears
during the first weeks|255216001|258705008|232714002|258705008
of life|224130005
and
generally
resolves
by age 10.|424144002

In more severe cases hemangiomas|242762006|24484000|398241000|400210000|242762006|24484000|413769002|400210000
may
leave|7771000|90737002
residual tissue damage.|65320000|37782003

In infancy,|3658006
it
is
the most common tumor.|4757001|72906007|108369006

The word "hemangioma"|255373000|400210000
comes
from the Greek _haema-_|1451003|87612001
(????
)
,
"blood"|87612001|119273009
;
_angeio_
(??????
)
,
"vessel"|59820001
;
_-oma_
(-???
)
,
"tumor".|108369006

The terminology
used|394850002
to
define
,
describe
and
categorize
vascular anomalies,|400159008
abnormal lumps|263654008|300848003
made up|255532002|353734004
of blood vessels,|59820001
has
changed.|243326001|263703002

The term _hemangioma_|400210000
was
originally
used|394850002
to
describe
any vascular tumor-|126736007
like structure,
whether
it
was
present|52101004|246105001
at
or
around birth|3950001
or
appeared later in life.|260383002|224130005

Mulliken
et
al.

categorized
these conditions|260905004
into two families|420797005|35359004
:
a family|35359004
of self-involuting tumors,|108369006
growing
lesions
that eventually
disappear
,
and
another family|35359004
of malformations,|276654001
enlarged|260376009|118452000
or
abnormal vessels|263654008|59820001
present|52101004|246105001
at birth|3950001
and
essentially permanent.|6934004

The importance
of this distinction
is
that
it
makes
it possible|371930009|60022001
for early-|264499004
in-life differentiation|224130005
between lesions
that
will
resolve
versus
those that
are
permanent.|6934004

Examples
of permanent malformations|6934004|276654001
include|55919000
port-wine stains|416377005
(capillary vascular malformation|234118009|59820001|20982000|20982000|400159008|255416003|255416003|400159008
)
and
masses|300848003|118538004
of abnormal swollen veins|263654008|248495005
(venous malformations|234124003|297222002
).[2]|260306008

Hemangiomas|400210000
are
connected
to the circulatory system.|113257007

The appearance|386548000|255412001
depends
on location.|246267002

If
they
are
on the surface|410678000
of the skin,|119325001|39937001|181469002
they
are
reminiscent
of a ripe strawberry|102261002
(hence,
they
are
sometimes
referred|439980006
to
as
"strawberry hemangiomas"|416824008
)
;
however,
if
they
are
just
under the skin|119325001|39937001|181469002
they
present|52101004|246105001
as a bluish swelling.|423666004|442672001

Sometimes
they
grow
in internal organs|260521003|410653004
such as the liver|10200004|181268008
or
larynx.|261115001|181212004

In most cases,|398241000|413769002
hemangiomas|400210000
will
disappear
over time.|410669006

Some
are
formed|35810008
during gestation|289908002
;
the most common|4757001|72906007
are
not congenital,|6160004|255399007
but
appear
during the first few weeks|255216001|258705008|232714002|258705008
of life.|224130005

They
are
often initially|70232002|884001
misdiagnosed
as a scratch|53181008
or
bruise|125667009
;
but
the correct diagnosis|439401001
becomes
obvious
with further growth.|46053002

Typically,
at the earliest phase in|264499004|21191007
a superficial lesion,|26283006
one|421379005
will
see|281004000
a bluish red area|48786000|42798000
with obvious blood vessels|59820001
and
surrounding pallor.|355648006|398979000

Sometimes
they
present|52101004|246105001
as a flat red|6041008|386713009|6041008|371240000|257564005|386713009|257564005|371240000
or
pink area.|371243003|42798000

Hemangiomas|400210000
are
the most common childhood tumor,|4757001|72906007|68433009|108369006
occurring|272120004
in approximately ten percent|26175008|23067006|118582008|26175008|420258001|118582008
of Caucasians,|413773004|185984009
and
are
less prevalent|276139006|263796003
in other ethnicities.|74964007|397731000

Females|248152002
are
three to five times|421291004|421820001|410669006|421291004|421820001|417929005
as likely to|2931005
have
hemangiomas|400210000
as males.|248153007

Hemangiomas|400210000
are
also more common|72906007
in twin pregnancies.|65147003

Approximately 80%|26175008
are
located
on the face|89545001|302549007
and
neck,|45048000|302550007
with the next most prevalent location|18769003|246267002|255260001|246267002
being
the liver.|10200004|181268008

in the "rest stage"|258157001|21191007|258157001|371508000|258157001|261612004

The cause|134198009
of hemangioma|400210000
is
currently|15240007
unknown|261665006
;
however,
several studies|261028005|110465008|261028005|224699009
have
suggested
the importance
of estrogen signaling|61946003|38952000
in hemangioma proliferation.|400210000|30217000

In 2007,
a paper|50833004
from the Stanford Children's Surgical Laboratory|410601007|83578000|261904005|160499008|83578000|261904005
revealed|263857004
that localized soft tissue hypoxia|255471002|181607009|389086002
coupled
with increased circulating estrogen|35105006|65929005|61946003|260366006|65929005|61946003
after birth|237679004|3950001|288563008|3950001
may
be
the stimulus.|8927009

There
is
also
a hypothesis
presented|246105001
by researchers
at Harvard
and
the University of Arkansas|224871002|224042002
that maternal placenta embolizes|72705000|62669004|72705000|181455002
to the fetal dermis|53534000
during gestation|289908002
resulting|42752001
in hemangiomagenesis.

However,
researchers
at Duke University|224871002
conducted|844005
genetic analyses|3950001|272389005|255395001|272389005
of single-nucleotide polymorphism|125681006|71211001|50334000|50607009|71211001|50334000
in hemangioma tissue|400210000|85756007
compared
to the mother's DNA|72705000|24851008
that
contradicted
this hypothesis.

More
research
is
required
in order
to fully
understand|66216009
the explosive nature|66113009|277302009
of hemangioma growth,|400210000
which
will
hopefully
yield
targeted therapeutics to|262202000
treat|395077000
its most complicated presentations.|255302009|246105001

Under the microscope,|65473004
hemangiomas|400210000
are
unencapsulated
aggregates|18403000
of closely
packed|53999001
,
thin-walled capillaries,|18043004|68947003|20982000
usually
with endothelial lining.|27168002|50009006

Blood-filled vessels|59820001
are
separated|13184001|263869007
by scant connective tissue.|181769001

Their lumens|113342003|398252006
may
be
thrombosed|118927008
and
organized.|385650005

Hemosiderin pigment|70748002|65863008
due to vessel rupture sometimes|59820001|415747007
can
be
noticed.

Glut1
is
a histochemical marker,
highly specific|75540009|69658003
for Haemangioma|400210000
and
can
be
used|394850002
to
differentiate|263933003
Haemangioma|400210000
from vascular malformations.[8]

The vast majority
of hemangiomas|400210000
are
not
associated|47429007
with complications.|116223007

Hemangiomas|400210000
may
break down|263690001
on the surface,|410678000
called ulceration.|429040005

If
the ulceration|429040005
is
deep, significant bleeding|131197000|386134007|131148009
may
occur|272120004
in rare occasions.|84638005|84638005|103356009|84638005

Ulceration|429040005
on the deeper area|131197000|42798000
can
be
painful|22253000
and
problematic.

If
a hemangioma|400210000
develops
in the larynx,|261115001|181212004
breathing|14910006|258162000
can
be
compromised.

A hemangioma|400210000
can
grow
and
block one|26036001|421379005|112232007|421379005
of the eyes,|81745001
causing|23981006
an occlusion amblyopia.|410486005

Very rarely,|260358002|103356009
extremely large hemangiomas|255509001|400210000
can
cause|23981006|134198009
high-output heart failure|10091002
due to the amount|107651007
of blood|87612001|119273009
that
must
be
pumped|44668000
to excess blood vessels.|260378005|59820001

Lesions
adjacent|18769003
to bone|272673000|3138006|90780006|128530007
can
also
cause|23981006|134198009
erosion|15498001
of the bone.|272673000|3138006|90780006|128530007

The most frequent complaints|4757001|70232002|409586006
about hemangiomas,|400210000
however,
stem
from psychosocial complications|116223007
:
the condition|260905004
can
affect|4065008
a person's appearance|386548000
and
can
provoke|410658008
attention|6769007
and
malicious reactions|263851003
from others.|74964007

Particular problems|55607006
occur|272120004
if
the lip|261114002|181221003
or
nose|260540009|181195007
is
involved,|248448006
as
distortion|20967005
can
be
difficult to|52925006
treat|395077000
surgically.|83578000

The potential|30207005
for psychological injury|60224009
develops
from school age onward.|257698009|424144002

It
is
therefore important to
consider
treatment|276239002|416118004
prior to school|257698009
if
adequate spontaneous improvement|51117008|5054005|88323005|5054005
has
not
occurred.|272120004

Children|410601007|160499008
with large segmental hemangiomas|255509001|62372003|400210000
of the head|69536005|302548004
and
neck|45048000|302550007
can
be
associated|47429007
with a disorder|64572001
called
PHACES Syndrome.[9][10]

Most hemangiomas|400210000
disappear
without treatment,|276239002|416118004
leaving|7771000|90737002
minimal|255605001|255604002
or
no visible marks.|24054004|46998006

Large hemangiomas|255509001|400210000
can
leave|7771000|90737002
visible skin|24054004|119325001|24054004|39937001|24054004|181469002
changes|243326001|263703002
secondary|2603003|81170007
to severe|24484000
stretching|122546009
of the skin|119325001|39937001|181469002
or
damage|37782003
to surface texture.|410678000|246200002

When
hemangiomas|400210000
interfere|78235001
with vision,|281004000
breathing|14910006|258162000
,
or
threaten significant cosmetic injury|386134007|81024003|386134007|261513001
(facial lesions|89545001
and
in particular, nose|260540009|181195007
and
lips|261114002
)
,
they
are
usually
treated.[11]|28995006

Until
recently,|6493001
the mainstay
of treatment|276239002|416118004
was
oral corticosteroid therapy,|260548002|297279009
but
there
are
now alternative treatments.|276239002

A randomized trial|110465008
showed
that
the beta-blocker propranolol|373254001|372772003
reduced|260400001
severe hemangiomas|24484000|400210000
in infants.|418119000

The topically applied beta blocker solution/gel Timolol|410618006|373254001|8537005|385100002|372880004|410618006|373254001|77899000|385100002|372880004
is
also
being
trialled
for small facial hemangiomas|255507004|89545001|400210000
that
do
not
justify
systemic treatment.|31099001|276239002|31099001|416118004

Other treatments|74964007|276239002
that
have
been
used|394850002
include|55919000
interferon[14]|49327004
or
vincristine.|387126006

They
may
be
considered
if first-line therapy|255216001|50009006|276239002|232714002|50009006|276239002
fails.

Surgical removal|118292001|128303001|128304007
is
sometimes
indicated|410535002
,
particularly
if
there
has
been
delay
in commencing treatment|276239002|416118004
and
structural changes|243326001|263703002
have
become
irreversible.

Surgery|83578000
may
also
be
necessary
to correct distortion|20967005
of facial features,|89545001
again
in the case|398241000
of inadequate|71978007
or
failed early medical intervention.|423637002|74188005

Blockage
of the airway|43725001|89187006
will
often|70232002
require
a tracheostomy to
be
performed|398166005
,
which
involves|248448006
the insertion|71861002|257867005
of an external airway|261074009|43725001|261074009|89187006
through the front|255549009
of the neck|45048000|302550007
into the trachea|44567001|181213009
below the level|258395000|276625007
of the obstruction.|26036001

Smaller raised lesions|263796003|260399008|255507004|260399008
are
sometimes
treated|28995006
with injection|28289002|385218009|129326001
of corticosteroid directly|79440004
into the lesion.

A pulsed dye laser|118346002
can
