*Human parainfluenza viruses (hPIVs)|407498006
*
*
are
the etiologic agents|134198009|260872001
causing|23981006
'human parainfluenza.'|278412004|12188008
hPIVs|407498006
are
a group|261586004|160481000|389109008
of four distinct serotypes|421534005|276770009
of enveloped single-stranded RNA viruses|125681006|11705000|50607009|11705000
belonging
to the paramyxovirus family.|35359004

These viruses|49872002
are
closely
associated|47429007
with
both
human|278412004
and
veterinary disease.|53216000|64572001

They
are
approximately 150-250 nm|26175008
in size|277049003
and
composed
of negative sense RNA|260385009|106148006|27888000
with a genome encompassing ~15,000 nucleotides.[2]|18470003|71211001

The viruses|49872002
can
be
detected|260373001
via cell culture,|4421005|252398009|4421005|61594008|362837007|252398009|362837007|61594008
immunofluorescent microscopy,|255800009|117259009
and
PCR.|258066000|103338009

hPIV
remains
the second main cause|81170007|63161005|134198009|257997001|63161005|134198009|288495006|63161005|134198009
of hospitalisation|394656005
in children|410601007|160499008
under 5 years|264706000|258707000|264605009|258707000
of age suffering|424144002
from a respiratory illness|258162000|39104002|449071006|39104002
(only respiratory syncytial virus|50607009|420295001
causes|134198009
more respiratory hospitalisations|242762006|258162000|394656005|242762006|449071006|394656005
for this age group|424144002|261586004|424144002|160481000|424144002|389109008
).[4]|260308009

The first hPIV|255216001|232714002
was
discovered
in the late 1950?s.|260383002

The taxonomic division|118630004
is
broadly
based|418836005
on antigenic|7120007
and
genetic characteristics,|3950001|255395001
forming|35810008
four major serotypes.|421534005|255603008|276770009

These
include|55919000
:

hPIV
is
closely
related|272151006|262094002
to a recently formed virus grouping,|6493001|35810008|49872002|6493001|35810008
the 'megamyxoviruses'
(Hendra
and
Nipah
and
closely
linked
to the metapneumovirus.|407501006

hPIV
is
divided|422033008
within two genera|420797005|18511007
:
_Respirovirus_|407487005
(hPIV-1 & hPIV-3|407489008
)
and
the _Rubulavirus_|128357008
(hPIV-2 & hPIV-4
).[2]|260306008

hPIV
is
characterised
by
being
enveloped
and
containing single stranded negative sense RNA.|42504009|125681006|260385009|106148006|27888000|42504009|50607009|260385009|106148006|27888000

Non-infectious virions|285296008
have
also
been
reported|229059009|223458004
with positive RNA polarity.|258758003|27888000|28562006|10828004|27888000|28562006

The genome|18470003
has
in the region|410673009
of 15,000 nucleotides|71211001
and
this
is
used to|394850002
encode
six key structural proteins.[2]|422218008|304381003

The structural gene sequence|14873000|72633008
is
believed to
be
as
follows|367409002
:
*
*3?-NP-P-M-F-HN-L-5?|223694009
*
*
(
the protein prefixes|88878007
and
further details|46053002
are
outlined
in the table|86407004
below
).[6]

With the advent
of reverse genetics,
it
has
been
found|404684003
that
the most efficient human parainfluenza viruses|4757001|260375008|407498006
(
in terms
of replication|74256009
and
transcription|10589004
)
have
a genome nucleotide total|18470003|71211001|258755000|18470003|71211001|255619001
which
is
divisible
by the number 6.|410680006|410681005

This
has
led|88488004|236874000
to the ?rule|10828004
of six?|422218008
being
coined.

Exceptions
to this rule|10828004
have
been
found|404684003
and
its exact advantages
are
not fully
understood.[7]|66216009

Electrophoresis|814007
has
shown
that
the molecular weight (MW)|290005005|27113001|290005005|272102008|290005005|39857003
of the proteins|88878007
for the four hPIV serotypes|421534005|276770009
are
similar
(
with the exception
of the phosphoprotein,
which
shows
significant variation|386134007|40885006
).

More information|242762006
on the structural proteins|304381003
can
be
found|404684003
in the paramyxovirus protein section|88878007|62083003|88878007|118630004
or
here.

Viral replication|74256009
is
initiated only
after successful entry|385669000
into a cell|4421005|362837007
by attachment|1431002
and
fusion|31883006|122501008
between the virus|49872002
and
the host cell lipid membrane.|53982002|70106000

Viral RNA|27888000
(vRNA
is
initially|884001
associated|47429007
with nucleoprotein (NP),|71185007
phosphoprotein (P)
and
the large protein|255509001|88878007
(L|258995007|420559008
).

The hemagglutinin-neuraminidase (HN)|80837006
is
involved|248448006
with viral attachment|1431002
and
thus hemadsorption
and
hemagglutination.|85000002

Furthermore,
the fusion (F) protein|422055000
is
important
in aiding|62479008|246088000
the fusion|31883006|122501008
of the host
and
viral cellular membranes,|115427003|4421005
eventually forming syncytia.[8]|35810008|81480003

Initially|884001
the F protein|372639009|88878007
is
in an inactive form|73425007|246176004
(F0
)
but
can
be
cleaved|227389000|9094003|58604003
by proteolysis to
form|246176004
its active form,|55561003|246176004
F1
and
F2,|258997004
linked
by di-sulphide bonds.|15771004|116252005|88183001|116252005|115689007|116252005

Once complete,|255594003
this
is
followed|367409002
by the hPIV nucleocapsid
entering|417985001
the cytoplasm
of the cell.|4421005|362837007

Subsequently,
genomic transcription|18470003|10589004
occurs|272120004
using|260676000
the viruses|49872002
own
'viral RNA-dependant RNA polymerase'|43751004
(L protein|258995007|88878007|420559008|88878007
).

The cells|4421005
own
ribosomes|26761006
are
then
tasked
with translation,
forming|35810008
the viral proteins|88878007
from the viral mRNA.[8]|69908008

Towards the end|261782000|422117008
of the process,|415178003
(
after the formation|11798007|255277001
of the viral proteins|88878007
)
the replication|74256009
of the viral genome|26497001
occurs.|272120004

Initially|884001
this
occurs|272120004
with the formation|11798007|255277001
of a positive-sense RNA|258758003|106148006|27888000|10828004|106148006|27888000
(intermediate step|11896004|398298007
necessary
for producing progeny|160499008
)
and
finally negative-sense RNA|260385009|106148006|27888000
is
formed|35810008
which
is
then
associated|47429007
with the nucleoprotein.|71185007

This
may
then
be
either
packaged
and
released|68776005|129299003
from the cell|4421005|362837007
by budding
or
it
can
be
used|394850002
for subsequent rounds|255260001|42700002
of transcription|10589004
and
replication.[9]|74256009

The observable
and
morphological changes|118956008
which
can
be
seen
in infected cells|4421005
includes|55919000
the enlargement|56246009|118452000|442021009
of the cytoplasm,
decreased|1250004|260400001|260371004
mitotic activity|48761009|55561003|258745004|257733005
and
'focal rounding,|87017008|42700002
'
with the potential formation|30207005|11798007|30207005|255277001
of multi-nucleate cells.[10]|260396001|4421005

The pathogenicity|264418008
of hPIV
is
mutually
dependant|371154000
on the virus|49872002
having
the correct accessory proteins|88878007
which
are
able to|371150009
elicit|263516000
anti-interferon properties.|49327004|370130000|49327004|116685008

This
is
a major factor|255603008
in the clinical significance|58147004|386134007
of disease.[9]|64572001

The main host|63161005
remains
the human.|278412004

Despite this,
infections
have
been
induced|16404004
in other animals|74964007|387961004
(
both
under natural|510009
and
experimental situations
)
although
these
were
always asymptomatic.[11]|84387000

In the USA|223688001
it
is
estimated|414135002
that there
are
5 million children|264706000|410601007|264706000|160499008|264605009|410601007|264605009|160499008
with lower respiratory infections (LRI)|261122009|275498002
each year.|258707000|259039008

Estimates|414135002
have
shown
that hPIV-1,|407489008
hPIV-2
and
hPIV-3
have
been
linked
with
up to a third|70905002
of these infections.

Upper respiratory infections (URI)|54150009
are
also important
in the context|263491009
of hPIV,
however
are
caused|23981006|134198009
to a lesser extent|263796003|255590007
by the virus.|49872002

The highest rates|75540009|371879000
of serious HPIV illnesses|42745003|39104002
occur|272120004
among young children|84422007|410601007|84422007|160499008
and
surveys
have
shown
that
about 75%
of children|410601007|160499008
aged|424144002|105436006
5
or
older|70753007
have
antibodies|68498002
to HPIV-1.|407489008

For infants|418119000
and
young children|84422007|410601007|84422007|160499008
it
has
been
estimated|414135002
that ~25%
will
develop ?clinically significant disease.'[15]|386134007|64572001

Repeated infection|27582007
throughout the life|224130005
of the host
is
not uncommon|103356009
and
symptoms
of later breakouts|260383002
include|55919000
upper respiratory tract illness,|58675001|39104002|361381009|39104002
such as cold|285686007|82272006|84162001
and
a sore throat.|405737000|267102003

The incubation period|406646006
for all four serotypes|421534005|276770009
is
1
to 7 days.|258703001

In immunosuppressed people,|125676002
parainfluenza virus infections
can
cause|23981006|134198009
severe pneumonia|24484000|205237003
which
can
be
fatal.[17]|399166001

hPIV-1|407489008
and
hPIV-2
have
been
demonstrated
to
be
the principal causative agent|63161005|362944004|302311007|362944004
behind croup|71186008
(laryngotracheobronchitis|85915003
which
is
a viral disease|34014006
of the upper airway|261183002|43725001|261183002|89187006
and
is
mainly problematic
in children|410601007|160499008
aged|424144002|105436006
6?48 months|258706009
of age.|424144002

Biennial epidemics
starting|255395001|385652002
in Autumn
are
associated|47429007
with
both
hPIV-1|407489008
and
2 however,|260306008
hPIV-2
can
also
have
yearly outbreaks.|53281000|443684005

Additionally,
HPIV-1|407489008
tends
to
cause|23981006|134198009
biennial outbreaks|443684005
of croup|71186008
in the fall.|1912002

In the United States,|223688001
large peaks|260382007
have
presently
been
occurring|272120004
during odd-numbered years.|410681005|258707000

hPIV-3
has
been
closely
associated|47429007
with bronchiolitis|4120002
and
pneumonia|205237003
and
principally
targets
those aged|424144002|105436006
<1 year.[20]|260305007|258707000|260305007|259039008

hPIV-4 remains infrequently|84638005
detected.|260373001

However,
it
is
now
believed
to
be
more common|242762006|72906007
than previously
thought|88952004
,
but
is
less likely to|276139006|2931005|263796003|2931005
cause|23981006|134198009
severe disease.|24484000|64572001

By the age|424144002
of 10,
the majority
of children|410601007|160499008
are
sero-positive|258758003|10828004
for hPIV-4 infection
which
may
be
indicative
of a large proportion|255509001|8212001
of asymptomatic|84387000
or
mild infections.[2]|255604002

Important epidemiological factors
that
are
associated|47429007
with a higher risk|15508007
of infection
and
mortality|409651001
are
those who
are
immuno-compromised|370391006
and
may
be
taken|419652001
ill|367391008
with more extreme forms|242762006|12565001|246176004
of LRI.

Associations|263534001
between hPIV
and
neurologic disease|118940003
are
known|36692007
,
for example hospitalisation|394656005
with certain types|17162000|261664005
of hPIV
has
a strong association|260404005|263534001|260404005|272151006
with febrile seizures.|41497008

hPIV-4B|264684005
has
the strongest association|260404005|263534001|260404005|272151006
(
up to 62%
)
followed|367409002
by hPIV-3
and
1.[2]|303183002

hPIV
has
also
been
linked
with rare cases|84638005|398241000|84638005|413769002|103356009|398241000|103356009|413769002
of virally caused meningitis[22]|23981006|7180009|134198009|7180009
and
Guillain-Barr? syndrome.[10]

HPIVs
are
spread|410677005
person|125676002
to person|125676002
by contact|11723008|70862002
with infected secretions|46242002
through respiratory droplets|258162000|449071006
or
contaminated surfaces|62604006|410678000
or
objects.|260787004

Infection
can
occur|272120004
when
infectious material|260769002
contacts|11723008|70862002
mucous membranes|313268005
of the eyes,|81745001
mouth,|74262004|123851003|21082005|181220002
or
nose,|260540009|181195007
and
possibly|60022001
through the inhalation|14910006|422237004
of droplets
generated
by a sneeze|162367006
or
cough.|272039006

HPIVs
can
remain
infectious
in airborne droplets
for over|21481007
an hour.|258702006|286551008

Overall,
hPIV remains
best known|20572008|36692007|3442003|36692007
for its effects|253861007
on the respiratory system|20139000|278197002
and
this
appears
to
be
where the majority
of the focus|87017008|363702006
has
been
upon.

The inflammation|257552002
of the airway|43725001|89187006
is
a common attribute|72906007|246061005
of hPIV infection.

It

believed to

Common cytokines|72906007|75777003
which
would
be
expected
to
be
up-regulated|255532002|353734004
include|55919000
IFN??,
various other interleukins|256220008|38476002
(IL?2,|428693003
IL-6|30965005

and
TNF??.

Various other chemokines|256220008
and
inflammatory proteins|88878007
are
also
believed
to
be
associated|47429007
with the common symptoms|72906007
of hPIV infection.[10]

Recent evidence|6493001|18669006
seems
to
suggest
that viral specific antibodies|77767001|69658003
(IgE
)
may
be
responsible|394851003
for
mediating|73510009
large scale|255509001|19892000|255509001|278111002
releases|115956009
of histamine|54235008

humoral immunity.|386325009|58915005

This
is
mainly
directed|255589003
against surface proteins|410678000|88878007
which
can
be
found|404684003
on the virus.|49872002

In particular
the proteins HN|88878007|223694009
and
F|372639009
prove|277025001
to
be
most immunogenic|7120007|58915005
in terms
of stimulating
the immune system.[10]|116003000

Recently|6493001
the importance
of the 'cell mediated immune system'|4421005|73510009|116003000|362837007|73510009|116003000
has
been
scrutinised.

Reports|229059009|223458004
have
shown
that
those
with defective adaptive immune responses|35024006
are
at a higher risk|15508007
of severe infection.[10]|24484000

Diagnosis|439401001
can
be
made
in several ways,|261028005
encompassing
a range
of multi-faceted techniques|260396001|21172007|272394005
:
[3]|260313008

Because of the similarity
in terms
of the antigenic profile|7120007
between the viruses,|49872002
hemagglutination assay (HA)|85000002
or
hemadsorption inhibition (HAdI) processes|61511001|415178003|419495008|415178003

Mortality|409651001
caused|23981006|134198009
by hPIV
in developed regions|410673009
of the world
remains
rare.|84638005|103356009

Where mortality|409651001
has
occurred|272120004
,
it
is
principally
in the three core risk groups|421291004|260235002|30207005|261586004|421291004|260235002|30207005|160481000
(very young, elderly|260358002|84422007|105436006
and
immuno-compromised.|370391006

Long term changes|243326001|263703002
can
however
be
associated|47429007
with airway remodelling|43725001|89187006
and
are
believed
to
be
a significant cause|386134007|134198009
of morbidity.

The exact associations|263534001
between hPIV
and
diseases|64572001
such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)|413846005
are
still
being
investigated.[24]|116698004

In developing regions|410673009
of the world,
the highest risk group|15508007|261586004|15508007|160481000|15508007|389109008
in terms

Mortality|409651001
may
be
as a consequence|103332005
of primary viral infection|63161005|34014006|261424001|34014006
or
secondary problems|2603003|55607006|81170007|55607006
such as bacterial infection.|301811001

Predispositions,|76522002
such as malnutrition|248325000
and
other deficiencies|74964007|260372006|74964007|248325000

hPIV
is
believed to
be

with 10%
of all LRI cases,|398241000|413769002
thus
remaining
a significant cause|386134007|134198009

Numerous factors|260396001
have
been
suggested
and
linked
to a higher risk|15508007
of acquiring|255396000
the infection,
inclusive of malnutrition,|248325000

overcrowding.[25]

Despite decades
of research,
no vaccines currently|398827000|15240007
