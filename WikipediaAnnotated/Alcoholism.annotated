*Alcoholism|7200002
*
*
is
a broad term|90522003
for problems|55607006
with alcohol,|419442005|53041004|430837008
and
is
generally
used|394850002
to
mean|255586005
compulsive
and
uncontrolled consumption|19032002
of alcoholic beverages,|53527002
usually
to the detriment
of the drinker's health,|263775005
personal relationships,|272151006
and
social standing.|10904000

It
is
medically
considered
a disease,|64572001
specifically
an addictive illness,|39104002
and
in psychiatry several other terms|80584001|394587001
are
used|394850002
,
specifically "alcohol abuse"|15167005
and
"alcohol dependence,|7200002
"
which
have
slightly different definitions.|425404009|263735002

In 1979
an expert World Health Organization committee|263775005|21139007
discouraged
the use|277889008|419385000
of "alcoholism"|7200002
in medicine,|410942007
preferring|225773000
the category
of "alcohol dependence syndrome".|7200002

In the 19th
and
early 20th centuries,|264499004
alcohol dependence|7200002
in general|60132005
was
called
dipsomania,|7200002
but
that term now
has
a much more specific meaning.|242762006|69658003|4757001|69658003

People|125676002
suffering
from alcoholism|7200002
are
often|70232002
called "alcoholics".|228281002

Many other terms,|74964007
some
of them insulting
or
informal,
have
been
used|394850002
throughout history.|392521001

The World Health Organization|263775005|21139007
estimates|414135002
that there
are
140 million people|125676002
with alcoholism worldwide.[4][5]|7200002

The American Medical Association|74188005|263534001|74188005|272151006
supports|9096001|243114000
a dual classification|73504009
of alcoholism to|7200002
include|55919000
both
physical|5880005|19388002
and
mental components.|246093002

The biological mechanisms|12893009|257544000
that
cause|23981006|134198009
alcoholism|7200002
are
not well understood.|20572008|66216009

Social environment,|48176007
stress,|262188008
[7] mental health,|263775005
family history,|57177007
age,|424144002
ethnic group,|397731000
and
gender|263495000
all
influence
the risk|30207005
for the condition.|260905004

Significant alcohol intake|386134007|160573003
produces
changes|243326001|263703002
in the brain's structure|12738006
and
chemistry,
though
some alterations
occur|272120004
with minimal use|255605001|277889008|255605001|419385000|255604002|277889008|255604002|419385000
of alcohol|419442005|53041004|430837008
over a short term period,|248967002
such as tolerance|228432001|77472006|71412006
and
physical dependence.|41784005

These changes|243326001|263703002
maintain|385630006
the person|125676002
with alcoholism's compulsive inability to|7200002
stop|422117008
drinking|160573003|30953006
and
result|394617004
in alcohol withdrawal syndrome|191480000
if
the person stops.|125676002|260890000

Alcohol damages|419442005|37782003|53041004|37782003|430837008|37782003
almost every organ|410653004
in the body,|279495008|123037004
including|55919000
the brain.|12738006|258335003

The cumulative toxic effects
of chronic alcohol abuse|7200002
can
cause|23981006|134198009
both
medical|74188005
and
psychiatric problems.[11]|27296002|55607006

Identifying alcoholism|7882003|7200002
is
difficult|52925006
for the individual|125676002|385435006
afflicted
because of the social stigma|9097005
associated|47429007
with the disease|64572001
that
causes|134198009
people|125676002
with alcoholism to|7200002
avoid
diagnosis|439401001
and
treatment|276239002|416118004
for fear|1402001
of shame
or
social consequences.|103332005

The evaluation responses|386053000
to a group|261586004|160481000|389109008
of standardized questioning
is
a common method|72906007|260686004|72906007|272394005
for diagnosing alcoholism.|439401001|7200002

These
can
be
used|394850002
to
identify|7882003
harmful drinking patterns,|272135003
including|55919000
alcoholism.|7200002

In general, problem drinking|60132005|15167005
is
considered alcoholism|7200002
when
the person|125676002
continues|255238004
to
drink|226465004
despite experiencing
social
or
health problems|263775005|55607006
caused|23981006|134198009
by drinking.[13]|160573003|30953006

Treatment|276239002|416118004
of alcoholism|7200002
takes|419652001
several steps.|261028005|398298007

Because of the medical problems|74188005|55607006
that
can
be
caused|23981006|134198009
by withdrawal,
alcohol detoxification|64297001
is
carefully
controlled|31509003
and
may
involve|248448006
medications|410942007
such as benzodiazepines|372664007
such as diazepam|387264003
(Valium|387264003
).

People|125676002
with alcoholism also sometimes|7200002
have
other addictions,|74964007|32709003
including|55919000
addictions|32709003
to benzodiazepines,|372664007
which
may
complicate|255302009
this step.|398298007

After detoxification,|67516001
other support|74964007|9096001|74964007|243114000
such as group therapy|76168009
or
self-help groups|224879000
are
used|394850002
to
help
the person|125676002
remain
sober.

Thombs
(1999
)
states|398070004
according to behavioural sciences alcoholism|844005|7200002
is
described
as a ?maladaptive behaviour?.|284499009

He
explains
this
must
not
be
confused|286933003
with ?misbehaviour?.

Behavioural scientists|844005|308027003
explain
that addicts
have
a behaviour|844005
pattern|272135003
that
may
lead|88488004
to destructive consequences|255303004|103332005
for themselves,
their families|35359004
and
society.

This
does
not label addicts
as bad|556001
or
irresponsible.

Compared
with men,|339947000
women|224526002
are
more sensitive|242762006|83185005
to alcohol's harmful physical, cerebral,|419442005|5880005|419442005|19388002|53041004|5880005|53041004|19388002|430837008|5880005|430837008|19388002
and
mental effects.[19]|253861007

Alcoholism|7200002
is
characterised
by an increased tolerance|102459008
of
and
physical dependence|41784005
on alcohol,|419442005|53041004|430837008
affecting|247591002|248448006
an individual's ability to|125676002|371150009|385435006|371150009
control|31509003
alcohol consumption safely.|160573003

These characteristics
are
believed
to
play|300776002
a role
in impeding
an alcoholic's ability to|228281002|371150009
stop|422117008
drinking.|160573003|30953006

Alcoholism|7200002
can
have
adverse effects
on mental health,|263775005
causing|23981006
psychiatric disorders|74732009
and
increasing|260369004
the risk|30207005
of suicide.|44301001

The onset|77374008
of depression|35489007|366979004|255339005
is
a common symptom.[20][21]|72906007

Long-term alcohol abuse|15167005
can
cause|23981006|134198009
a number|410680006|410681005
of physical symptoms,|5880005|19388002
including|55919000
cirrhosis|19943007
of the liver,|10200004|181268008
pancreatitis,|75694006
epilepsy,|313307000
polyneuropathy,|42345000
alcoholic dementia,|281004
heart disease,|56265001
nutritional deficiencies,|248325000
peptic ulcers[22]|13200003
and
sexual dysfunction,|56627002|231532002
and
can
eventually
be
fatal.|399166001

Other physical effects|74964007|5880005|253861007|74964007|19388002|253861007
include|55919000
an increased risk|35105006|30207005|260366006|30207005
of developing cardiovascular disease,|49601007
malabsorption,|32230006
alcoholic liver disease,
and
cancer.|363346000|372087000

Damage|37782003
to the central nervous system|21483005|278199004
and
peripheral nervous system|3058005
can
occur|272120004
from sustained alcohol consumption.|263892007|160573003

A wide range|90522003
of immunologic defects|71922006
can
result|394617004
and
there
may
be
a generalized skeletal fragility,|60132005|113192009|59955000
in addition|260364009
to a recognized tendency
to accidental injury,|242056005
resulting|42752001
a propensity
to bone fractures.[25]|125605004

Women|224526002
develop
long-term complications|116223007
of alcohol dependence more rapidly|7200002|418694008
than
do
men.|339947000

Additionally,
women|224526002
have
a higher mortality rate|75540009|409651001|371879000|409651001
from alcoholism|7200002
than men.|339947000

Examples
of long-term complications|116223007
include|55919000
brain,|12738006|258335003
heart,|80891009|302509004
and
liver damage[27]|243978007
and
an increased risk|35105006|30207005|260366006|30207005
of breast cancer.|254837009|254838004

Additionally,
heavy drinking|410712002|160573003|410712002|30953006
over time|410669006
has
been
found|404684003
to
have
a negative effect|260385009|253861007
on reproductive functioning|118255001
in women.|224526002

This results|394617004
in reproductive dysfunction|386585008
such as anovulation,|34571000
decreased|1250004|260400001|260371004
ovarian mass,|289922002
problems|55607006
or
irregularity|49608001
of the menstrual cycle,|78456001
and
early menopause.|373717006

Alcoholic ketoacidosis|55571001
can
occur|272120004
in individuals|125676002|385435006
who chronically
abuse|26416006|386702006|417928002
alcohol|419442005|53041004|430837008
and
have
a recent history|6493001|6493001|392521001
of binge drinking.[28][29]|439960005|160573003|439960005|30953006

Even
though
alcoholism|7200002
can
increase|260366006
the risk|30207005
of liver cancer,|93870000
studies|110465008|224699009
have
shown
that
a moderate consumption|6736007
of alcohol|419442005|53041004|430837008
(1
serving
/day|258703001|259032004
for women|224526002
and
2 servings/day|260306008|258703001|260306008|259032004
for men|339947000
)
does
not
affect|4065008
diabetes Type II greatly.|44054006

Long-term misuse
of alcohol|419442005|53041004|430837008
can
cause|23981006|134198009
a wide range|90522003
of mental health problems.|413307004

Severe cognitive problems|24484000|55607006
are
common|72906007
;
approximately 10 percent|26175008|118582008
of all dementia cases|12348006|398241000|12348006|413769002|52448006|398241000|52448006|413769002
are
related|272151006|262094002
to alcohol consumption,|160573003
making
it the second leading cause|81170007|236874000|134198009|257997001|236874000|134198009|288495006|236874000|134198009
of dementia.|12348006|52448006

Excessive alcohol use causes|260378005|160573003|134198009
damage|37782003
to brain function,|12738006|246464006|258335003|246464006
and
psychological health|60224009|263775005
can
be
increasingly
affected|247591002|248448006
over time.[31]|410669006|264664006

Social skills
are
significantly
impaired|260379002|40226000
in people|125676002
suffering
from alcoholism|7200002
due to the neurotoxic effects|19466003
of alcohol|419442005|53041004|430837008
on the brain,|12738006|258335003
especially
the prefrontal cortex area|40146001|42798000
of the brain.|12738006|258335003

The social skills
that
are
impaired|260379002|40226000
by alcohol abuse|15167005
include|55919000
impairments|40226000
in perceiving facial emotions,|81742003|89545001|285854004
prosody perception problems|35622009|81742003|55607006
and
theory
of mind deficits|260372006
;
the ability to|371150009
understand|66216009
humour|386325009
is
also
impaired|260379002|40226000
in alcohol abusers.[32]|419442005|53041004|430837008

Psychiatric disorders|74732009
are
common|72906007
in alcoholics,|228281002
with
as
many
as 25 percent|118582008
suffering
severe psychiatric disturbances.|24484000|27296002

The most prevalent psychiatric symptoms|4757001|75864003
are
anxiety|48694002|197480006
and
depression disorders.|35489007

Psychiatric symptoms usually initially|75864003|884001
worsen|230993007|390772001
during alcohol withdrawal,|191480000
but
typically
improve|385425000|3442003|385633008
or
disappear
with continued abstinence.|255238004|105542008

Psychosis,|69322001|191525009
confusion,|286933003
and
organic brain syndrome
may
be
caused|23981006|134198009
by alcohol misuse,|419442005|53041004|430837008
which
can
lead|88488004
to a misdiagnosis
such as schizophrenia.|58214004

Panic disorder|371631005
can
develop
or
worsen|230993007|390772001
as a direct result|255589003|394617004
of long-term alcohol misuse.[35][36]|419442005|53041004|430837008

The co-occurrence|272120004
of major depressive disorder|370143000
and
alcoholism|7200002
is
well documented.|20572008|397934002

Among those with comorbid occurrences,|20401003|272120004|421463005|272120004
a distinction
is
commonly
made
between depressive episodes|35489007
that remit|255319006
with alcohol abstinence|419442005|105542008|53041004|105542008|430837008|105542008
("substance-induced"|105590001|16404004
)
,
and
depressive episodes|35489007
that
are
primary|63161005|261424001
and
do
not
remit|255319006
with abstinence|105542008
("independent" episodes|371153006|272128006
).

Additional use|260364009|277889008|260364009|419385000
of other drugs|74964007|410942007
may
increase|260366006
the risk|30207005
of depression.[43]|35489007|366979004|255339005

Psychiatric disorders|74732009
differ
depending
on gender.|263495000

Women|224526002
who
have
alcohol-use disorders often|160573003|64572001|70232002
have
a
co-occurring|272120004
psychiatric diagnosis|27296002|439401001|27296002
such as major depression,|370143000
anxiety,|48694002|197480006
panic disorder,|371631005
bulimia,
post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD),|47505003
or
borderline personality disorder.|20010003

Men|339947000
with alcohol-use disorders more often|160573003|64572001|70232002
have
a
co-occurring|272120004
diagnosis|439401001
of narcissistic
or
antisocial personality disorder,|26665006

schizophrenia,|58214004
impulse disorders|263781002|64572001
or
attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder.|406506008

Women|224526002
with alcoholism|7200002
are
more likely to|242762006|2931005
have
a history|392521001
of physical|5880005|19388002
or
sexual assault,|248110007
abuse|26416006|386702006|417928002
and
domestic violence|404189009
than those
in the general population,|60132005|385436007|60132005|389109008
[44]
which
can
lead|88488004
to higher instances|75540009|371879000
of psychiatric disorders|74732009
and
greater dependence|263768009|255338002
on alcohol.|419442005|53041004|430837008

The social problems|161152002
arising|68727004
from alcoholism|7200002
are
serious,|42745003
caused|23981006|134198009
by the pathological changes|394595002|243326001|394595002|263703002|29458008|243326001|29458008|263703002
in the brain|12738006|258335003
and
the intoxicating effects|253861007
of alcohol.|419442005|53041004|430837008

Alcohol abuse|15167005
is
associated|47429007
with an increased risk|35105006|30207005|260366006|30207005
of committing criminal offences,
including|55919000
child abuse,|418189009
domestic violence,|404189009
rape,|22439003|86147000|112601000
burglary
and
assault.|52684005

Alcoholism|7200002
is
associated|47429007
with loss
of employment,
[47]
which
can
lead|88488004
to financial problems.|160932005

Drinking|160573003|30953006
at inappropriate times,|410669006|417929005
and
behavior|844005
caused|23981006|134198009
by reduced judgment,|260400001|61254005
can
lead|88488004
to legal consequences,|398165009|103332005
such as criminal charges
for drunk driving[48]|228354000
or
public disorder,|64572001
or
civil penalties
for tortious behavior,|844005
and
may
lead|88488004
to a criminal sentence.

An alcoholic's behavior|228281002|844005
and
mental impairment,|419284004|47437004
while
drunk,|25702006|86933000
can
profoundly
affect|4065008
those surrounding|355648006
them
and
lead|88488004
to isolation|40174006|46651001
from family|35359004
and
friends.|113163005

This isolation|40174006|46651001
can
lead|88488004
to marital conflict|65118005
and
divorce,|20295000
or
contribute
to domestic violence.|404189009

Alcoholism|7200002
can
also
lead|88488004
to child neglect,|419686005|418496002
with subsequent lasting damage|255260001|37782003
to the emotional development|285854004|278923009|408453002|278923009
of the alcoholic's children.|228281002|410601007|228281002|160499008

For this reason,|410666004
children|410601007|160499008
of alcoholic parents|133940008
can
develop
a number|410680006|410681005
of emotional problems.|386816005

For example,
they
can
become
afraid|1402001
of their parents,|40683002
because of their unstable mood behaviors.|18963009|844005|18963009

In addition,|260364009
they
can
develop
considerable amount|107651007
of shame
over their inadequacy to|71978007
liberate
their parents|40683002
from alcoholism.|7200002

As a result|394617004
of this failure,|76797004
they
develop
wretched self-images,|225510008
which
can
lead|88488004
to depression.[50]|35489007|366979004|255339005

As
with similar substances|105590001
with a sedative-hypnotic mechanism,|257544000
such as barbiturates|372798009
and
benzodiazepines,|372664007
withdrawal
from alcohol dependence|7200002
can
be
fatal|399166001
if
it
is
not properly
managed.|119270007

Alcohol's primary effect|419442005|63161005|253861007|419442005|261424001|253861007|53041004|63161005|253861007|53041004|261424001|253861007|430837008|63161005|253861007|430837008|261424001|253861007
is
the increase|260366006
in stimulation|122545008
of the GABAA receptor,|116647005
promoting
central nervous system depression.|418072004

With repeated heavy consumption|27582007|410712002
of alcohol,|419442005|53041004|430837008
these receptors|116647005
are
desensitized
and
reduced|260400001
in number,|410680006|410681005
resulting|42752001
in tolerance|228432001|77472006|71412006
and
physical dependence.|41784005

When
alcohol consumption|160573003
is
stopped too abruptly,|385654001
the person's nervous system suffers|125676002|25087005|125676002|278196006
from uncontrolled synapse firing.|19032002|69147006

This
can
result|394617004
in symptoms
that
include|55919000
anxiety,|48694002|197480006
life threatening seizures,|224130005|91175000
delirium tremens,|8635005
hallucinations,|7011001
shakes|26079004
and
possible heart failure.|371930009|84114007|371930009|42343007|60022001|84114007|60022001|42343007

Other neurotransmitter systems|74964007|35069000|246333005
are
also
involved|248448006
,
especially dopamine,|412383006|32779004
NMDA
and
glutamate.[10][54]|430503006|104697004

Severe acute withdrawal symptoms|24484000|272118002|88069000
such as delerium tremens|8635005
and
seizures rarely|91175000|103356009
occur|272120004
after 1 week|260305007|258705008|260305007|259038000
post cessation|288563008
of alcohol.|419442005|53041004|430837008

The acute withdrawal phase|255251009
can
be
defined
as lasting
between one|421379005
to three weeks.|421291004|258705008

In the period|259037005
of 3 ? 6 weeks|260281002|258705008
following|255260001
cessation
increased|35105006|260366006
anxiety,|48694002|197480006
depression|35489007|366979004|255339005
as well as
sleep disturbance|53888004|44186003
is
common|72906007
;[55] fatigue|264691008|84229001
and
tension|53489000
can
persist
for
up to 5 weeks|264706000|258705008|264605009|258705008
as part|260726005
of the post-acute withdrawal syndrome|288563008|272118002
;
about a quarter
of alcoholics|228281002
experience
anxiety|48694002|197480006
and
depression|35489007|366979004|255339005
for
up to 2 years.|260306008|258707000

These post-acute withdrawal symptoms|288563008|272118002|88069000
have
also
been
demonstrated
in animal models|387961004
of alcohol dependence|7200002
and
withdrawal.

A kindling effect also|253861007
occurs|272120004
in alcoholics|228281002
whereby each subsequent withdrawal syndrome|255260001
is
more severe|242762006|24484000
than the previous withdrawal episode|9130008|272128006
;
this
is
due to neuroadaptations
which
occur|272120004
as a result|394617004
of periods|259037005
of abstinence|105542008
followed|367409002
by re-exposure|228877007|71677004|228877007|24932003
to alcohol.|419442005|53041004|430837008

Individuals|125676002|385435006
who
have
had
multiple withdrawal episodes|288528003
are
more likely to|242762006|2931005
develop
seizures|91175000
and
experience
more severe anxiety|242762006|24484000|48694002|242762006|24484000|197480006
during withdrawal
from alcohol|419442005|53041004|430837008
than alcohol dependent individuals|419442005|371154000|125676002|419442005|371154000|385435006|53041004|371154000|125676002|53041004|371154000|385435006|430837008|371154000|125676002|430837008|371154000|385435006
without a history|392521001
of past alcohol withdrawal episodes.|410513005|191480000|272128006

The kindling effect|253861007
leads|88488004|236874000
to persistent functional changes|40143009|243326001|40143009|263703002|246464006|243326001|246464006|263703002
in brain neural circuits|12738006|3057000|12738006|256864008|258335003|3057000|258335003|256864008
as well as
to gene expression.|89551006

Kindling also
results|394617004
in psychological symptoms|25618008
of alcohol withdrawal|191480000
becoming
more
intensified.[55]|264691008

A complex mixture|103360007|272163001
of genetic|3950001|255395001
and
environmental factors|102487004
influences
the risk|30207005
of the development|278923009
of alcoholism.|7200002

Genes|67271001
that
influence
the metabolism|47722004
of alcohol also|419442005|53041004|430837008
influence
the risk|30207005
of alcoholism,|7200002
and
may
be
indicated|410535002
by a family history|57177007
of alcoholism.|7200002

One paper|421379005|50833004
has
found|404684003
that alcohol use|160573003
at an early age|264499004|424144002
may
influence
the expression|10012005
of genes|67271001
which
increase|260366006
the risk|30207005
of alcohol dependence.|7200002

Individuals|125676002|385435006
who
have
a genetic disposition|3950001|255395001
to alcoholism|7200002
are
also more likely to|2931005
begin|255395001
drinking|160573003|30953006
at an earlier age|264499004|424144002
than average.[61]

Also,
a younger age|84422007|424144002
of onset|77374008
of drinking|160573003|30953006
is
associated|47429007
with an increased risk|35105006|30207005|260366006|30207005
of the development|278923009
of alcoholism,|7200002
[61]
and
about 40 percent|259031006|118582008
of alcoholics|228281002
will
drink|226465004
excessively|260378005
by their late adolescence.|260383002|22396007

It
is
not entirely
clear|263707001
whether
this association|263534001|272151006
is
causal,|134198009
and
some researchers
have
been
known|36692007
to disagree
with this view.|246516004

A high testosterone concentration|75540009|43688007|82742001|75540009|85470006|82742001|371879000|43688007|82742001|371879000|85470006|82742001
during pregnancy|289908002
may
be
a risk factor|80943009
for later development|260383002|278923009
of alcohol dependence.[63]|7200002

Severe childhood trauma|24484000|68433009|24484000|68433009
is
also
associated|47429007
with a general increase|60132005|260366006
in the risk|30207005
of drug dependency.|2403008

Lack|41277001
of peer
and
family support|243115004
is
associated|47429007
with an increased risk|35105006|30207005|260366006|30207005
of alcoholism|7200002
developing.

Genetics
and
adolescence|22396007
are
associated|47429007
with an increased sensitivity|35105006|35209006|35105006|365705006|260366006|35209006|260366006|365705006
to the neurotoxic effects|19466003
of chronic alcohol abuse.|7200002

Cortical degeneration|68594002|33359002|40146001|33359002|50403003|33359002
due to the neurotoxic effects|19466003
increases|260366006
impulsive behaviour,|286756000|844005
which
may
contribute
to the development,|278923009
persistence|130965009
and
severity|272141005
of alcohol use disorders.|160573003|64572001

There
is
evidence|18669006
that
with abstinence,|105542008
there
is
a reversal
of
at least
some
of the alcohol|419442005|53041004|430837008
induced|16404004
central nervous system damage.[64]|21483005|37782003|278199004|37782003

Genetic differences|3950001|263735002|255395001|263735002
exist
between different racial groups|263735002|415229000
which
affect|4065008
the risk|30207005
of developing alcohol dependence.|7200002

For example,
there
are
differences|263735002
between African,|413464008
East Asian|414978006
and
Indo-racial groups|415229000
in
how
they
metabolize
alcohol.|419442005|53041004|430837008

These genetic factors|3950001|255395001
are
believed
to,
in part,|260726005
explain
the differing rates
of alcohol dependence|7200002
among racial groups.|415229000

The alcohol dehydrogenase allele ADH1 B|87336008|9109004
*3|260313008
causes|134198009
a more rapid metabolism|242762006|255358001|47722004
of alcohol.|419442005|53041004|430837008

The allele ADH1 B|9109004
*3|260313008
is
only
found|404684003
in those
of African descent|413464008
and
certain Native American tribes.|17162000|413490006

African Americans|15086000
and
Native Americans|413490006
with this allele|9109004
have
a reduced risk|260400001|30207005
of developing alcoholism.|7200002

Native Americans however,|413490006
have
a significantly higher rate|75540009|371879000
of alcoholism|7200002
than average
;
it
is
unclear
why
this
is
the case.|398241000

Other risk factors|74964007|80943009
such as cultural environmental effects e.g.|252398009|276339004|253861007|258795003|61594008|276339004|253861007|258795003

trauma
have
been
proposed
to
explain
the higher rates|75540009|371879000
of alcoholism|7200002
among Native Americans|413490006
compared
to alcoholism levels|430837008

This
can
be
attributed|246061005
to many reasons,|410666004
the main|63161005
being
that women|224526002

A given amount|107651007

A given amount|107651007
of alcohol|419442005|53041004|430837008
causes|134198009
greater intoxication|263768009

of alcohol|419442005|53041004|430837008
which
may

defined
by _
The Dietary Guidelines|41829006
for Americans_
as no more|242762006
than two alcoholic beverages|420797005|53527002

during a heavy drinking period.[73]|386692008|160573003|386692008|30953006

The term "alcoholism"|7200002
is
commonly
used|394850002
,
but
poorly|556001
defined.

The
WHO
calls
alcoholism "|7200002
a term
of long-standing use|255511005|10904000|277889008|255511005|10904000|419385000
and
variable meaning",|255372005
and
use|277889008|419385000
of the term
was
disfavored
by a 1979
WHO Expert Committee.

_
The Big Book_|255509001|278212002
(
from Alcoholics Anonymous|161109002
states|398070004
that
once
a person|125676002
is
an alcoholic,|228281002
they
are
always
an alcoholic,|228281002
but
does
not
define
what
is
meant|255586005
by the term "alcoholic"|228281002
in this context.|263491009

In 1960,
Bill W.,|27883009
co-founder|44066000
of Alcoholics Anonymous (AA),|161109002
said|66049007
:

In professional
and
research contexts,|263491009
the term "alcoholism" sometimes|7200002
encompasses
both
alcohol abuse|15167005
and
alcohol dependence,|7200002
[75]
and
sometimes
is
considered equivalent|9726003|258726008
to alcohol dependence.|7200002

Talbot
(1989
)
observes
that alcoholism|7200002
in the classical disease model|255333006|64572001|260997001|64572001
follows|367409002
a progressive course|255314001|288524001
:
if
a person|125676002
continues|255238004
to
drink|226465004
,
their condition|260905004
will
worsen.|230993007|390772001

This
will
lead|88488004
to harmful consequences|103332005
in their life,|224130005
physically,
mentally,
emotionally
and
socially.[76]

Johnson
(1980
)
explores
the emotional progression|285854004|246453008|285854004|246450006|408453002|246453008|408453002|246450006
of the addict?s response
to alcohol.|419442005|53041004|430837008

He
looks|386548000
at this in four phases.|52101004|421534005|272108007|18720000|421534005|272108007

The first two|255216001|420797005|232714002|420797005
are
considered ?normal? drinking|17621005|160573003|17621005|30953006|258744000|160573003|258744000|30953006
and
the last two|420797005
are
viewed|246516004
as "typical" alcoholic drinking.|53527002

Johnson's four phases|421534005|272108007
consist
of
:

Other theorists|74964007
such as Milam & Ketcham
(1983
)
focus|87017008|363702006
on the physical deterioration|5880005|19388002
of alcohol.|419442005|53041004|430837008

They
describe
the process|415178003
in three stages|421291004|261612004
:

In psychology|60224009
and
psychiatry,|80584001|394587001
the DSM
is
the most common global standard,|4757001|72906007|60132005
while
in medicine,|410942007
the standard
is
ICD.|70199000

The terms
they
recommend
are
similar
but
not identical.|20323000

The term "alcoholism"|7200002
was
split
into "alcohol abuse"|15167005
and
"alcohol dependence"|7200002
in 1980's DSM-III,|257471003
and
in 1987's DSM-III-R behavioral symptoms|257471003|24028007|844005
were
moved|384598002|370125004
from "abuse"|26416006|386702006|417928002
to "dependence".|255338002

It
has
been
suggested
that DSM-V merge alcohol abuse|15167005
and
alcohol dependence|7200002
into a single new entry,|125681006|7147002|50607009|7147002
[81] named "alcohol-use disorder".[82]|27468005|160573003|64572001

Despite the imprecision
inherent
in the term,
there
have
been
attempts
to
define
how
the word "alcoholism"|255373000|7200002
should
be
interpreted|363714003
when
encountered.

In 1992,
it
was
defined
by the NCADD
and
ASAM
as "
a primary, chronic disease|56416009|90734009|63161005|27624003|261424001|27624003
characterized
by impaired control|260379002|31509003|40226000|31509003
over drinking,|160573003|30953006
preoccupation|247632002
with the drug alcohol,|410942007|419442005|410942007|53041004|410942007|430837008
use|277889008|419385000
of alcohol|419442005|53041004|430837008
despite adverse consequences,|103332005
and
distortions|20967005
in thinking."[84] MeSH|88952004|404213007
has
had
an entry
for "alcoholism" since 1999,|7200002
and
references
the 1992 definition.[85]

AA
describes
alcoholism|7200002
as an illness|39104002
that
involves|248448006
a physical allergy[86]|5880005|408439002|5880005|421961002|19388002|408439002|19388002|421961002
:

(
where "allergy"|408439002|421961002
has
a different meaning|263735002
than that
used|394850002
in modern medicine.[87]|410942007

and
a mental obsession.[86]|67698009

A 1960 study|110465008|224699009
by [E.

Morton Jellinek]
(/wiki/E._Morton_Jellinek
)
is
considered
the foundation|418836005
of the modern disease theory|64572001
of alcoholism.|7200002

Jellinek's definition
restricted|263856008
the use|277889008|419385000
of the word "alcoholism"|255373000|7200002
to those showing
a particular natural history.|510009|510009|392521001

The modern medical definition|74188005
of alcoholism|7200002
has
been
revised numerous times since then.|261560009|260396001|410669006|261560009|260396001|417929005

The American Medical Association currently|74188005|263534001|15240007|74188005|272151006|15240007
uses|277889008|394850002|260676000|419385000
the word alcoholism to|255373000|7200002
refer|439980006
to a particular chronic primary disease.[90]|27624003|63161005|264705001|27624003|63161005|264703008|27624003|261424001|264705001|27624003|261424001|264703008|90734009|56416009|264705001|90734009|56416009|264703008

Attitudes|225464009
and
social stereotypes|5507002
can
create
barriers
to the detection
and
treatment|276239002|416118004
of alcohol abuse.|15167005

This
is
more
of a barrier
for women|224526002
than men.|339947000

Fear|1402001
of stigmatization
may
lead|88488004
women to|224526002
deny|441889009
that
they
are
suffering
from a medical condition,|74188005|260905004
to
hide|421332005
their drinking,|160573003|30953006
and
to
drink|226465004
alone.|105529008

This pattern,|272135003
in turn,|282987006
leads|88488004|236874000
family,|35359004
physicians,|309343006
and
others to|74964007
be
less likely to|276139006|2931005|263796003|2931005
suspect|415684004
that
a woman|224526002
they
know|36692007
is
an alcoholic.|228281002

In contrast,
reduced fear|260400001|260400001|1402001
of stigma|9097005
may
lead|88488004
men to|339947000
admit|32485007
that
they
are
suffering
from a medical condition,|74188005|260905004
to
display
their drinking publicly,|160573003|30953006
and
to
drink|226465004
in groups.|261586004|160481000

This pattern,|272135003
in turn,|282987006
leads|88488004|236874000
family,|35359004
physicians,|309343006
and
others to|74964007
be
more likely to|242762006|2931005
suspect|415684004
that
a man|248153007|339947000|278412004
they
know|36692007
is
an alcoholic.[44]|228281002

Several tools|261028005|86967005
may
be
used|394850002
to
detect|260373001
a loss
of control|31509003
of alcohol use.|160573003

These tools|86967005
are
mostly self-reports|229059009|223458004
in questionnaire form.|246176004

Another common theme|72906007
is
a score|278061009
or
tally
that sums
up the general severity|60132005|272141005
of alcohol use.[12]|160573003

The CAGE questionnaire,|273347006
named|27468005
for its four questions,|421534005|42425007
is
one|421379005
such example
that
may
be
used|394850002
to
screen|20135006|360156006
patients quickly|116154003
in a doctor's office.

Two "yes" responses|420797005
indicate|410535002
that
the respondent
should
be
investigated|116698004
further.|46053002

The questionnaire
asks
the following questions|255260001|42425007
:

Other tests|74964007|269814003|74964007|272393004
are
sometimes
used|394850002
for the detection
of alcohol dependence,|7200002
such as the Alcohol Dependence Data Questionnaire,|7200002
which
is
a more sensitive diagnostic test|242762006|83185005|103693007
than the CAGE questionnaire.|273347006

It
helps
distinguish
a diagnosis|439401001
of alcohol dependence|7200002
from one|421379005
of heavy alcohol use.|410712002|160573003

The Michigan Alcohol Screening Test (MAST)|273608000
is
a screening tool|20135006|86967005
for alcoholism widely|7200002
used|394850002
by courts to
determine
the appropriate sentencing
for people|125676002
convicted
of alcohol-related offenses,|419442005|272151006|419442005|262094002|53041004|272151006|53041004|262094002|430837008|272151006|430837008|262094002
[95] driving|129060000
under the influence
being
the most common.|4757001|72906007

The Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT),|273265007
a screening questionnaire|20135006
developed
by the World Health Organization,|263775005|21139007
is
unique
in
that
it
has
been
validated
in six countries|422218008|223369002
and
is
used internationally.|394850002

Like the CAGE questionnaire,|273347006
it
uses|277889008|394850002|260676000|419385000
a simple set|13673007
of questions ?|42425007
a high score earning|75540009|278061009|371879000|278061009
a deeper investigation.|131197000|386053000

was
designed
to

for alcohol related problems|419442005|272151006|55607006|419442005|262094002|55607006|53041004|272151006|55607006|53041004|262094002|55607006|430837008|272151006|55607006|430837008|262094002|55607006
amongst those attending Accident|55566008
and
Emergency departments.|225728007

It
concords
well|20572008
with the AUDIT questionnaire
but
is
administered|418283001
in a fifth|32088001
of the time.[97]|410669006|260309001|410669006|264708004

Nurnberger,
Jr.,
and
Laura Jean Bierut|228210008
suggest
that alcoholism|7200002

They also
report|229059009|223458004
that fewer|57176003
than a dozen alcoholism-related genes|7200002|272151006|67271001|7200002|262094002|67271001
have
been
identified|7882003
,
but
that more likely await discovery.[98]|242762006|2931005

At least one genetic test|276139006|421379005|405824009|263796003|421379005|405824009
exists
for an allele|9109004
that
is
correlated
to alcoholism|7200002
and
opiate addiction.|75544000

Human dopamine receptor genes|82256003|37484001
have
a detectable variation|40885006
referred|439980006
to
as the DRD2 TaqI polymorphism.|50334000

Those
who
possess
the A1 allele|9109004
(variation|40885006
)
of this polymorphism|50334000
have
a small|255507004
but
significant tendency|386134007
towards addiction|32709003
to opiates|5602001|360204007
and
endorphin-releasing drugs|53682000|129299003|410942007
like alcohol.|419442005|53041004|430837008

Although
this allele|9109004
is
slightly more common|425404009|72906007
in alcoholics|228281002
and
opiate addicts,|360204007
it
is
not
by itself
an adequate predictor|51117008|88323005
of alcoholism,|7200002
and
some researchers
argue
that evidence|18669006
for DRD2
is
contradictory.[98]

The DSM-IV diagnosis|439401001
of alcohol dependence|7200002
represents
one approach|421379005
to the definition
of alcoholism.|7200002

In part|260726005
this
is
to
assist|116697009|119265000
in the development|278923009
of research protocols|258049002
in which findings|404684003
can
be
compared
to
one|421379005
another.

According to the DSM-IV,
an alcohol dependence diagnosis|7200002|439401001|7200002
is
:
[13]

There
are
reliable tests|269814003|272393004
for the actual use|277889008|419385000
of alcohol,|419442005|53041004|430837008
one common test|421379005|72906007|269814003|421379005|72906007|421379005|72906007|272393004
being
that
of blood alcohol content (BAC).|87612001|419442005|276824008|87612001|53041004|276824008|87612001|430837008|276824008|119273009|419442005|276824008|119273009|53041004|276824008|119273009|430837008|276824008

These tests|269814003|272393004
do
not
differentiate|263933003
alcoholics|228281002
from non-alcoholics|228281002
;
however,
long-term heavy drinking|410712002|160573003|410712002|30953006
does
have
a few recognizable effects|57176003|253861007
on the body,|279495008|123037004
including|55919000
:
[102]

However,
none|260413007
of these blood tests|252275004
for biological markers|12893009
is
as sensitive|83185005
as screening questionnaires.|20135006

The World Health Organization,|263775005|21139007
the European Union|414152003
and
other regional bodies,|74964007|410673009|279495008|74964007|410673009|123037004|74964007|255470001|279495008|74964007|255470001|123037004
national governments
and
parliaments
have
formed alcohol policies|35810008|419442005|35810008|53041004|35810008|430837008
in order to
reduce|260400001
the harm
of alcoholism.|7200002

Targeting adolescents|133937008
and
young adults|84422007|133936004
is
regarded
as an important step to|398298007
reduce|260400001
the harm
of alcohol abuse.|15167005

Increasing|260369004
the age|424144002
at which
licit
drugs|410942007
of abuse|26416006|386702006|417928002
such as alcohol|419442005|53041004|430837008
can
be
purchased
,
the banning
or
restricting|263856008
advertising
of alcohol|419442005|53041004|430837008
has
been
recommended
as additional ways|260364009
of reducing|260400001
the harm
of alcohol dependence|7200002
and
abuse.|26416006|386702006|417928002

Credible, evidence|18669006
based|418836005
educational campaigns|266981003|409073007
in the mass media|300848003|61695000|118538004|61695000
about the consequences|103332005
of alcohol abuse|15167005
have
been
recommended.

Guidelines
for parents to|40683002
prevent
alcohol abuse|15167005
amongst adolescents,|133937008
and
for helping young people|84422007|125676002
with mental health problems|413307004
have
also
been
suggested.[105]

Treatments|276239002
are
varied
because
there
are
multiple perspectives|260396001
of alcoholism.|7200002

Those
who
approach
alcoholism|7200002
as a medical condition|74188005|260905004
or
disease|64572001
recommend
differing treatments|276239002
than,
for instance,
those
who
approach
the condition|260905004
as one|421379005
of social choice.

Most treatments focus|276239002|87017008|276239002|363702006
on helping people|125676002
discontinue|410546004|421286000
their alcohol intake,|160573003
followed|367409002
up
with life training|224130005|118629009
and/or
social support|315042007
in order to
help
them
resist
a return|7528007
to alcohol use.|160573003

Since
alcoholism|7200002
involves|248448006
multiple factors|260396001
which
encourage
a person to|125676002
continue|255238004
drinking,|160573003|30953006
they
must
all
be
addressed|397635003
in order
to successfully
prevent
a relapse.|263855007|255318003|58184002

An example
of this kind|261664005
of treatment|276239002|416118004
is
detoxification|67516001
followed|367409002
by a combination|89780004
of supportive therapy,|243114000
attendance
at self-help groups,|224879000
and
ongoing development|255238004|278923009
of coping mechanisms.|405056001|257544000

The treatment community|276239002|133928008|416118004|133928008
for alcoholism typically|7200002
supports|9096001|243114000
an abstinence-based zero tolerance approach|105542008|258317007|228432001|105542008|258317007|77472006|105542008|258317007|71412006|105542008|418836005|258317007|228432001|105542008|418836005|258317007|77472006|105542008|418836005|258317007|71412006
;
however,
some
prefer|225773000
a harm-reduction approach.[106]|58294000|260400001|289928003

Alcohol detoxification|64297001
or
'detox'
for alcoholics|228281002
is
an abrupt stop|422117008
of alcohol drinking|160573003|219006
coupled
with the substitution
of drugs,|410942007
such as benzodiazepines,|372664007
that
have
similar effects to|253861007
prevent
alcohol withdrawal.|191480000

Individuals|125676002|385435006
who
are
only at risk|50607009|30207005|420295001|30207005
of mild to moderate withdrawal symptoms|371923003|88069000
can
be
detoxified
as outpatients.|373864002

Individuals|125676002|385435006
at risk|410519009
of a severe withdrawal syndrome|24484000
as well as
those who
have
significant|386134007
or
acute comorbid conditions|272118002|398192003
are
generally
treated|28995006
as inpatients.|416800000

Detoxification|67516001
does
not actually
treat|395077000
alcoholism,|7200002
and
it
is
necessary to follow-up detoxification|308273005|67516001
with an appropriate treatment program|276239002|416118004
for alcohol dependence|7200002
or
abuse|26416006|386702006|417928002
in order to
reduce|260400001
the risk|30207005
of relapse.|263855007|255318003|58184002

Some symptoms
of alcohol withdrawal|191480000
such as depressed mood|366979004
and
anxiety typically|48694002|197480006
take|419652001
weeks|258705008
or
months to|258706009
abate
while
other symptoms|74964007
persist
longer|255511005
due to persisting neuroadaptations.

Alcoholism|7200002
has
serious adverse effects|42745003
on brain function|12738006|246464006|258335003|246464006
;
on average
it
takes|419652001
one year|421379005|258707000|421379005|259039008
of abstinence to|105542008
recover|74822006
from the cognitive deficits|260372006
incurred
by chronic alcohol abuse.[108]|7200002

Various forms|256220008|246176004
of group therapy|76168009
or
psychotherapy|75516001
can
be
used|394850002
to
deal
with underlying psychological issues|60224009|55607006
that
are
related|272151006|262094002
to alcohol addiction,|7200002
as well as
provide
relapse prevention skills.|405782001

The mutual-
help
group-counseling approach|261586004|409063005|261586004|265913000|160481000|409063005|160481000|265913000|389109008|409063005|389109008|265913000
is
one|421379005
of the most common ways|4757001|72906007
of helping alcoholics|228281002
maintain|385630006
sobriety.

Alcoholics Anonymous|161109002
was
one|421379005
of the first organizations|255216001|21139007|232714002|21139007
formed|35810008
to
provide
mutual, nonprofessional counseling,|409063005|265913000
and
it
is
still
the largest.|255509001|263768009

Others|74964007
include|55919000
LifeRing Secular Recovery,
SMART Recovery,
Women|224526002
For Sobriety,
and
Secular Organizations|21139007
for Sobriety.

Rationing
and
moderation
programs
such as Moderation Management|413454004|119270007
and
DrinkWise
do
not
mandate
complete abstinence.|255594003|105542008

While
most alcoholics|228281002
are
unable to|371151008
limit|255469002
their drinking|160573003|30953006
in this way,
some

moderate|6736007
drinking.|160573003|30953006

A 2002
US
study|110465008|224699009
by the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA)|385437003|7200002
showed
that 17.7 percent|118582008
of individuals|125676002|385435006
diagnosed|439401001
as alcohol dependent more|419442005|371154000|53041004|371154000|430837008|371154000
than one year|421379005|258707000|421379005|259039008
prior|236874000
returned|7528007
to low-risk drinking.|62482003|30207005|160573003|62482003|30207005|30953006|371880002|30207005|160573003|371880002|30207005|30953006

This group,|261586004|160481000|389109008
however,
showed
fewer initial symptoms|57176003|884001|57176003|232714002
of dependency.|371154000

A follow-up study,|308273005|110465008|308273005|224699009
using|260676000
the same subjects|262126009
that
were
judged|11205001
to
be
in remission|277022003
in 2001?2002,
examined|64049009
the rates
of return|7528007
to problem drinking|15167005
in 2004?2005.

The study|110465008|224699009
found|404684003
abstinence|105542008
from alcohol|419442005|53041004|430837008
was
the most stable form|4757001|58158008|246176004
of remission|277022003
for recovering alcoholics.|74822006|228281002

A long-term
(60 year|258707000|259039008
)
follow-up|308273005
of two groups|420797005|261586004|420797005|160481000
of alcoholic men|228281002|339947000
concluded
that "return|7528007
to controlled drinking rarely|31509003|160573003|103356009|31509003|30953006|103356009
persisted
for much more|242762006
than a decade
without relapse|263855007|255318003|58184002
or
evolution
into abstinence."[111]|105542008

A variety
of medications|410942007
may
be
prescribed
as part|260726005
of treatment|276239002|416118004
for alcoholism.|7200002

Alcoholics|228281002
may
also
require
treatment|276239002|416118004
for other psychotropic drug addictions.|74964007|418183005|32709003

The most common dual addiction|4757001|72906007|32709003
in alcohol dependence|7200002
is
benzodiazepine dependence,|231473004
with studies|110465008|224699009
showing
10?20 percent|118582008
of alcohol-dependent individuals|419442005|371154000|125676002|419442005|371154000|385435006|53041004|371154000|125676002|53041004|371154000|385435006|430837008|371154000|125676002|430837008|371154000|385435006
had
problems|55607006
of dependence|255338002
and/or
misuse problems|55607006
of benzodiazepines.|372664007

Benzodiazepines|372664007
increase|260366006
cravings
for alcohol|419442005|53041004|430837008
and
the volume|118565006|419569009
of alcohol|419442005|53041004|430837008
consumed
by problem drinkers.|228281002

Benzodiazepine dependency|231473004
requires
careful reduction|58294000|260400001|289928003
in dosage to|277406006
avoid
benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome|372664007|574005
and
other health consequences.|74964007|263775005|103332005

Dependence|255338002
on other sedative hypnotics|74964007
such as zolpidem|387569009
and
zopiclone|395929002
as well as
opiates|5602001|360204007
and
illegal drugs|77657003
is
common|72906007
in alcoholics.|228281002

Alcohol|419442005|53041004|430837008
itself
is
a sedative-hypnotic
and
is
cross-tolerant|65145006
with other sedative-hypnotics|74964007
such as barbiturates,|372798009
benzodiazepines|372664007
and
nonbenzodiazepines.

Dependence|255338002
upon
and
withdrawal
from sedative hypnotics
can
be
medically severe|24484000
and
,
as
with alcohol withdrawal,|191480000
there
is
a risk|30207005
of psychosis|69322001|191525009

an alcohol dependence problem|7200002|55607006
at some time|410669006
in their life.|224130005

The World Health Organization|263775005|21139007
estimates|414135002
that
about 140 million people|125676002
throughout the world
suffer
from alcohol dependence.|7200002

In the United States|223688001
and
Western Europe,|223658005
10
to 20 percent|118582008
of men|339947000
and
5
to 10 percent|118582008
of women|224526002
at some point
in their lives|224130005
will
meet|229057006
criteria
for alcoholism.[127]|7200002

Within the medical|74188005
and
scientific communities,|133928008
there
is
broad consensus regarding alcoholism|90522003|7200002
as a disease state.|64572001|398070004

For example,
the American Medical Association|74188005|263534001|74188005|272151006
considers
alcohol|419442005|53041004|430837008
a drug|410942007
and
states|398070004
that "drug addiction|2403008
is
a chronic,|90734009
relapsing|263855007|255318003
brain disease|81308009
characterized
by compulsive drug seeking|410942007
and
use|277889008|419385000
despite
often devastating consequences.|70232002|103332005

It
results|394617004
from a complex|103360007
interplay
of biological vulnerability,|12893009
environmental exposure,|276339004|71677004|276339004|24932003
and
developmental factors|278923009
(
e.g.

)."[90]|264705001|264703008

Alcoholism|7200002
has
a higher prevalence|75540009|371879000
among men,|339947000
though
in recent decades,|6493001
the proportion|8212001
of female alcoholics|248152002|228281002|224526002|228281002
has
increased.|35105006|260366006

Current evidence|15240007|18669006
indicates|410535002
that
in
both
men|339947000
and
women,|224526002
alcoholism|7200002
is
50?60 percent genetically|118582008
determined
,
leaving|7771000|90737002
40?50 percent|259031006|118582008
for environmental influences.|276339004

Most alcoholics|228281002
develop
alcoholism|7200002
during adolescence|22396007
or
young adulthood.[58]|84422007|41847000

A 2002 study|110465008|224699009
by the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism|385437003|7200002
surveyed
a group|261586004|160481000|389109008
of 4,422 adults|260308009|133936004

with the breakdown|40091007|125366008
as
follows|367409002
:
25 percent|118582008
were
found|404684003
to
be
still dependent, 27.3 percent|371154000|118582008
were
in partial remission|103337004
(
some symptoms
persist
)
,
11.8 percent asymptomatic drinkers|118582008|84387000
(consumption
increases|260366006
chances
of relapse|263855007|255318003|58184002
)
and
35.9 percent|118582008
were
fully
recovered ? made up|74822006|255532002|74822006|353734004
of 17.7 percent low-risk drinkers|118582008|62482003|30207005|118582008|371880002|30207005
plus 18.2 percent abstainers.[129]|118582008

In contrast,
however,
the results|394617004
of a long-term
(60-year|258707000|259039008
)
follow-up|308273005
of two groups|420797005|261586004|420797005|160481000
of alcoholic men|228281002|339947000
by George Vaillant
at Harvard Medical School|74188005|257698009
indicated|410535002
that "return|7528007
to controlled drinking rarely|31509003|160573003|103356009|31509003|30953006|103356009
persisted
for much more|242762006
than a decade
without relapse|263855007|255318003|58184002
or
evolution
into abstinence."[130] Vaillant also|105542008
noted
that "return-to-controlled drinking,|7528007|31509003|160573003|7528007|31509003|30953006
as
reported|229059009|223458004
in short-term studies,|110465008|224699009
is
often|70232002
a mirage."

The most common cause|4757001|72906007|134198009
of death|419620001|268923008
in alcoholics|228281002
is
from cardiovascular complications.|40172005

There
is
a high rate|75540009|371879000
of suicide|44301001
in chronic alcoholics,|90734009|228281002
which
increases|260366006
the longer|255511005
a person drinks.|125676002|226465004

This
is
believed to
be
due to alcohol|419442005|53041004|430837008
causing|23981006
physiological distortion|1360005|20967005
of brain chemistry,|12738006|258335003
as well as
social isolation.|422650009

Suicide|44301001
is
also very common|260358002|72906007
in adolescent alcohol abusers,|133937008|419442005|133937008|53041004|133937008|430837008
with 25 percent|118582008
of suicides|44301001
in adolescents|133937008
being
related|272151006|262094002
to alcohol abuse.|15167005

Approximately 18 percent|26175008|118582008
of alcoholics|228281002
commit
suicide,|44301001
[21]
and
research
has
found|404684003
that
over 50 percent|118582008
of all suicides|44301001
are
associated|47429007
with alcohol|419442005|53041004|430837008
or
drug dependence.|2403008

The figure
is
higher|75540009|371879000
for adolescents,|133937008
with alcohol|419442005|53041004|430837008
or
drug misuse|361055000
playing|300776002
a role
in
up to 70 percent|118582008
of suicides.[133]|44301001

Historically
the name dipsomania|7200002
was
coined
by German physician Dr.|7695005|309343006|309343006

[C.

W.

Hufeland]
(/wiki/C._W._Hufeland
)
in 1819
before
it
was
superseded
by alcoholism.|7200002

The term "alcoholism"|7200002
was
first|255216001|232714002
used|394850002
in 1849
by the Swedish physician Magnus Huss to|309343006
describe
the systematic adverse effects|246333005
of alcohol.[136]|419442005|53041004|430837008

Alcohol|419442005|53041004|430837008
has
a long history|255511005|255511005|392521001
of use|277889008|419385000
and
misuse
throughout recorded history.|392521001

Biblical, Egyptian|297308004|1919006
and
Babylonian sources|260753009
record
the history|392521001
of abuse|26416006|386702006|417928002
and
dependence|255338002
on alcohol.|419442005|53041004|430837008

In some ancient
cultures|252398009|61594008
alcohol|419442005|53041004|430837008
was
worshiped
and
in others|74964007
its abuse|26416006|386702006|417928002
was
condemned.

Excessive alcohol misuse|260378005|419442005|260378005|53041004|260378005|430837008
and
drunkenness|25702006
were
recognised
as causing social problems even thousands|23981006|161152002
of years ago.|258707000

However,
the defining
of habitual drunkenness|40451002|25702006
as
it
was
then
known|36692007
as
and
its adverse consequences|103332005
were
not well established medically|20572008|263748003|20572008|385645004
until the 18th century.

In 1647
a Greek monk named Agapios|1451003|27468005
was
the first to|255216001|232714002
document|397966007
that chronic alcohol misuse|7200002
was
associated|47429007
with toxicity
to the nervous system|25087005|278196006
and
body|279495008|123037004
which
resulted|42752001|394617004
in a range
of medical disorders|74188005|64572001
such as seizures,|91175000
paralysis|44695005
and
internal bleeding.|260521003|131148009

In 1920
the effects|253861007
of alcohol abuse|15167005
and
chronic drunkenness|90734009|25702006
led|88488004|236874000
to the failed prohibition
of alcohol|419442005|53041004|430837008
being
considered
and
eventually
enforced
briefly
in America.

In 2005
the cost
of alcohol dependence|7200002
and
abuse|26416006|386702006|417928002
was
estimated|414135002
to
cost
the US economy approximately 220 billion|26175008
dollars|284175004
per year,|258707000|259039008
more
than cancer|363346000|372087000
and
obesity.[137]|414915002

The various health problems|256220008|263775005|55607006
associated|47429007
with long-term alcohol consumption|160573003
are
generally
perceived|81742003
as detrimental
to society,
for example,
money
due to lost labor-hours,|289909005|258702006|261041009|258702006
medical costs,|74188005
and
secondary treatment costs.|2603003|276239002|2603003|416118004|81170007|276239002|81170007|416118004

Alcohol use|160573003
is
a major contributing factor|255603008
for head injuries,|82271004
motor vehicle accidents,|418399005
violence,
and
assaults.|52684005

Beyond money,
there
are
also significant social costs|386134007
to both
the alcoholic|228281002
and
their family|35359004
and
friends.|113163005

For instance,
alcohol consumption|160573003
by a pregnant woman|255409004
can
lead|88488004
to fetal alcohol syndrome,|205788004
[138]
an incurable
and
damaging condition.[139]|260905004

Estimates|414135002
of the economic costs
of alcohol abuse,|15167005
collected
by the World Health Organization,|263775005|21139007
vary
from one|421379005
to six percent|422218008|118582008
of a country's GDP.|223369002|57858007

One Australian estimate pegged alcohol's social costs|421379005|414135002|419442005|421379005|414135002|53041004|421379005|414135002|430837008
at 24%
of all drug abuse costs|26416006
;
a similar Canadian
study|110465008|224699009
concluded alcohol's share|419442005|53041004|430837008
was
41%.

One study|421379005|110465008|421379005|224699009
quantified
the cost
to the UK
of _
all_ forms|246176004
of alcohol misuse|419442005|53041004|430837008
in 2001
as ?18.5?20 billion.

All economic costs
in the United States|223688001
in 2006
have
been
estimated|414135002
at $223.5 billion.[143]

Stereotypes|5507002
of alcoholics|228281002
are
often|70232002
found|404684003
in fiction
and
popular culture.|252398009|61594008

The 'town drunk'|288521009|25702006|288521009|86933000|288521009
is
a stock character
in Western popular culture.|252398009|61594008

Stereotypes|5507002
of drunkenness|25702006
may
be
based|418836005
on racism
or
xenophobia,|34652008
as
in the depiction
of the Irish
as heavy drinkers.|25702006|86933000

Studies|110465008|224699009
by social psychologists Stivers|59944000
and
Greeley
attempt
to
document|397966007
the perceived prevalence|81742003
of high alcohol consumption|75540009|160573003|371879000|160573003
amongst the Irish
in America.[145]

Alcohol consumption|160573003
is
relatively similar
between many European cultures,|414152003|252398009|414152003|61594008|252398009|61594008

and
Australia.|223621005

In Asian countries|223571003
that
have
a high gross domestic product,|75540009|255344003|261770009|371879000|255344003|261770009
there
is
heightened|260365005|260366006
drinking|160573003|30953006
compared
to other Asian countries,|74964007|223571003
but
it
is
nowhere near|40415009
as high|75540009|371879000
as
it
is
in other countries|74964007|223369002
like the United States.|223688001

It
is
also inversely
seen
,
with countries|223369002
that
have
very low gross domestic product|260362008|255344003|261770009

done
on Korean immigrants|38361009|161158003

they
reported|229059009|223458004
alcohol|419442005|53041004|430837008
was
even
an integral part|263786007|260726005

occur.|272120004

They also
believe
alcohol|419442005|53041004|430837008
is
necessary
at any social event|272379006
as
it
helps

start.[147]|255395001

Caucasians|413773004|185984009

(33.4%|264667004
