*Melioidosis|428111003
*
*
is
an infectious disease|191415002
caused|23981006|134198009
by a Gram-negative bacterium,|81325006
_Burkholderia pseudomallei_,|116399000
found|404684003
in soil|415555003
and
water.|11713004|119318008

It
is
of public health importance|310115006
in endemic areas,|42798000
particularly
in Thailand|223594002
and
northern Australia.|223621005

It
exists
in acute|272118002
and
chronic forms.|90734009|246176004

Symptoms
may
include|55919000
pain|22253000
in chest,|261179002
bones,|272673000|128530007
or
joints|39352004|81087007
;
cough|272039006
;
skin infections,|108365000
lung nodules|196662004
and
pneumonia.|205237003

_B.

pseudomallei_
was
previously
classed|258391009
as part|260726005
of the _Pseudomonas_ genus|5274006|18511007
and
until 1992,
it
was
known|36692007
as
_Pseudomonas pseudomallei_.|116399000

It
is
phylogenetically
related|272151006|262094002
closely
to _Burkholderia mallei_|113674000
which
causes|134198009
glanders,|4639008
an infection primarily
of horses,|35354009
donkeys|85626006
and
mules.|228236001

The name Melioidosis|428111003
is
derived
from the Greek _melis_|1451003
(?????
)
meaning "
a distemper
of asses"|85626006
with the suffixes -oid meaning "similar|76401005
to"
and -
osis meaning "
a condition",|260905004
that
is
,
a condition|260905004
similar
to glanders.[1]|4639008

Melioidosis|428111003
is
endemic
in parts|260726005
of southeast Asia|223585008
(
including|55919000
Thailand,|223594002
[2] Laos[3][4][5]|223590006
and
southern China,|223581004
[6] Singapore,|223593008
[7] Malaysia,|223591005
Burma|223587000
and
Vietnam|223595001
)
,
Taiwan[8][9]|428675004
and
northern Australia.|223621005

Multiple cases|260396001|398241000|260396001|413769002
have
also
been
described
in Hong Kong|223382005
and
Brunei[12] India,|223586009|223600005
[13][14][15]
and
sporadic cases|75741005|398241000|75741005|413769002
in Central|26216008
and
South America,|223504005
[16][17][18]
the Middle East,|223605000
the Pacific
and
several African countries.|261028005|223508008

Although
only one case|50607009|421379005|398241000|420295001|421379005|398241000
of melioidosis|428111003
has
ever
been
reported|229059009|223458004
in Bangladesh,|223598004
[19]
at least five cases|276139006|421820001|398241000|276139006|421820001|413769002|263796003|421820001|398241000|263796003|421820001|413769002
have
been
imported
to the UK
from
that country,|223369002
which
suggests
that melioidosis|428111003
is
endemic
to
that country|223369002
and
that there
is
a serious problem|42745003|55607006
of underdiagnosis
or
under-reporting,|261089000|223458004
[20] most likely|2931005
due to a lack|41277001
of adequate laboratory facilities.|51117008|261904005|88323005|261904005

Northeast Thailand|223594002
has
the highest incidence|75540009|371879000
of melioidosis|428111003
recorded
in the world
(21.3 cases|398241000|413769002
of melioidosis|428111003
per 100,000 people|125676002
per year|258707000|259039008
).

In Northeast Thailand,|223594002
80%
of children|410601007|160499008
are
positive|258758003|10828004
for antibodies|68498002
against _B.

pseudomallei_
by the age|424144002
of 4|260308009
;[22]
the figures
are
lower|261122009
in other parts|74964007|260726005
of the world.[23][24][25][26]|264657009

Melioidosis|428111003
is
a recognised disease|64572001
in animals,|387961004
including|55919000
cats,|448169003|388618001
[27] goats,|125097000|388249000
sheep,|388254009|255392003
and
horses.|35354009

Cattle,
water buffalo,|28692007
and
crocodiles|107258009
are
considered
to
be
relatively resistant|30714006
to melioidosis|428111003
despite their constant exposure|71677004|24932003
to mud.

An outbreak|443684005
at the Paris Zoo|7074004
in the 1970s
("_L?affaire du jardin des plantes_"|258995007|396026002|258995007|230782004|420559008|396026002|420559008|230782004
)
was
thought|88952004
to
have
originated
from an imported panda.[29]

_Burkholderia pseudomallei_|116399000
is
normally
found|404684003
in soil|415555003
and
surface water|410678000|11713004|410678000|119318008
;
a history|392521001
of contact|11723008|70862002
with soil|415555003
or
surface water|410678000|11713004|410678000|119318008
is
therefore almost invariable
in patients|116154003
with melioidosis|428111003
;[10]
that said,|66049007
the majority
of patients|116154003
who
do
have
contact|11723008|70862002
with infected soil|415555003
suffer
no ill effects.|367391008|253861007

Even
within an area,|42798000
the distribution|255464007
of _B.

pseudomallei_
within the soil|415555003
can
be
extremely patchy,|10027005
[30][31]|264664006
and
competition
with other _Burkholderia_ species|74964007|414324002|74964007|116201008
has
been
suggested
as a possible reason.|371930009|410666004|60022001|410666004

Contaminated|62604006
ground water|15537006|11713004|15537006|119318008
was
implicated
in one outbreak|421379005|443684005
in northern Australia.|223621005

Also
implicated
are
severe weather events|24484000|272379006
such as flooding[34] tsunamis[35]|111056004|36230009
and
typhoons.[36][37]

It
has
been
suggested
,
on the basis|418836005
of whole genome sequencing,|260232004|18470003
that humans|278412004
may
play|300776002
a role
in moving _B.

pseudomallei_
from place to|257557008|421066005
place.[38]|257557008|264670000|421066005|264670000

The single most important risk factor|125681006|80943009|50607009|80943009
for developing severe melioidosis|24484000|428111003
is
diabetes mellitus.|73211009

Other risk factors|74964007|80943009
include|55919000
thalassaemia,|40108008
kidney disease,|90708001
occupation|14679004
(rice paddy farmers|67324005|106388008
)
,
[39]
and
cystic fibrosis.|190905008

The mode
of infection
is
believed to
be
either
through a break in
the skin,|119325001|39937001|181469002
or
through the inhalation|14910006|422237004
of aerosolized _B.

pseudomallei_.

Person-to-person|125676002
spread|410677005
has
been
described
but
is
extremely unusual.[40][41][42]|259031006

There
is
a clear association|263707001|263534001|263707001|272151006
with increased rainfall|35105006|260366006
:
with the number|410680006|410681005
(
and
severity|272141005
)
of cases|398241000|413769002
increasing|260369004
following|255260001
increased precipitation.[43][44][7][45][46]|35105006|21738005|35105006|418684003|260366006|21738005|260366006|418684003

In the subgroup
of patients|116154003
where an inoculating event|272379006
was
noted
,
the mean incubation period|255586005|406646006
of acute melioidosis|272118002|428111003
was
9 days|258703001
(range 1?21 days|258703001
).

Patients|116154003
with latent melioidosis|44104002|428111003
may
be
symptom free|37837009
for decades
;
the longest period|255511005|259037005
between presumed exposure|71677004|24932003
and
clinical presentation|58147004|246105001
is
62 years.|258707000

The potential|30207005
for prolonged incubation|255224006
was
recognized
in US servicemen
involved|248448006
in the Vietnam War,|223595001
and
was
referred|439980006
to
as
the "Vietnam time-bomb".|223595001|410669006|54807002

There
is
a wide spectrum|90522003
of severity|272141005
;
in chronic presentations,|90734009|246105001
symptoms
may
last
months,|258706009
but
fulminant infection,
particularly
associated|47429007
with near-drowning,|87970004
may
present|52101004|246105001
with severe symptoms|162470006
over hours.|258702006

A patient|116154003
with active melioidosis usually|55561003|428111003
presents|52101004|246105001
with fever.|386661006

Pain|22253000
or
other symptoms|74964007
may
be
suggestive|7196007
of a clinical focus,|58147004|87017008|58147004|363702006
which
is
found|404684003
in
around 75%
of patients.|116154003

Such symptoms
include|55919000
cough|272039006
or
pleuritic chest pain|2237002
suggestive|7196007
of pneumonia,|205237003
bone|272673000|3138006|90780006|128530007
or
joint pain|57676002
suggestive|7196007
of osteomyelitis|60168000
or
septic arthritis,|372938004|372939007
or
cellulitis.|128045006

Intra-abdominal infection|128070006
(
including|55919000
liver|10200004|181268008
and/or
splenic abscesses,|82053000
or
prostatic abscesses|8725005
)
do
not usually
present|52101004|246105001
with focal pain,|87017008|22253000
and
imaging|363679005|278395004
of these organs|410653004
using|260676000
ultrasound|359659005
or
CT
should
be
performed|398166005
routinely.

In one series|421379005|13039001
of 214 patients,|116154003
27.6%
had
abscesses|128477000
in the liver|10200004|181268008
or
spleen|78961009|181279003
(95% confidence interval,|225487001|385673002
22.0%
to 33.9%|264667004
).

It
has
been
suggested
that _B.

pseudomallei_ abscesses|128477000
have
a characteristic "honeycomb"|47260009|227599006
or
"swiss cheese" architecture|76574004|102264005
(hypoechoic,
multi-septate,|260396001|255584008
multiloculate|58083006
)
on CT.[49][50]

There
are
regional variations|410673009|40885006|255470001|40885006
in disease presentation|64572001|246105001
:
parotid abscesses characteristically|45289007|128477000
occur|272120004
in Thai children|83365001|410601007|83365001|160499008
but
this presentation|246105001
has
only
been
described
once
in Australia.|223621005

Conversely,
prostatic abscesses|8725005
are
found|404684003
in
up to 20%
of Australian males|248153007
but
are
rarely|103356009
described
elsewhere.

An encephalomyelitis syndrome|62950007
is
recognised
in northern Australia.|223621005

Patients|116154003
with melioidosis usually|428111003
have
risk factors|80943009
for disease,|64572001
such as diabetes,|73211009
thalassemia,|40108008
hazardous alcohol use|160573003
or
renal disease,|90708001
and
frequently|70232002
give|419582001
a history|392521001
of occupational|87923000
or
recreational exposure|71677004|24932003
to mud
or
pooled surface water.|69297003|410678000|11713004|69297003|410678000|119318008

However,
otherwise healthy patients,|263775005|116154003
including|55919000
children,|410601007|160499008
may
also
get
melioidosis.|428111003

In
up to 25%
of patients,|116154003
no focus|87017008|363702006
of infection
is
found|404684003
and
the diagnosis|439401001
is
usually
made
on blood cultures|30088009
or
throat swab.|258529004

Melioidosis|428111003
is
said to|66049007
be
able to|371150009
affect|4065008
any organ|410653004
in the body|279495008|123037004
except the heart valves|17401000
(endocarditis|56819008
).

Although
meningitis|7180009
has
been
described secondary|2603003|81170007
to ruptured brain abscesses,|415747007|441806004|263862003|441806004
primary meningitis|63161005|7180009|261424001|7180009
has
not
been
described.

Less common manifestations|276139006|72906007|250255003|276139006|72906007|251190009|263796003|72906007|250255003|263796003|72906007|251190009
include|55919000
intravascular infection,|261101003
lymph node abscesses|44298000
(1.2?2.2%|303183002
)
,
[53] pyopericardium|22167000
and
myocarditis,|50920009
mediastinal infection,|312157006
and
thyroid|69748006|61020000
and
scrotal abscesses|27717006
and
ocular infection.|128351009

Chronic melioidosis|90734009|428111003
is
usually
defined
by a duration|103335007
of symptoms
greater|263768009
than 2 months|260306008|258706009
and
occurs|272120004
in approximately 10%|26175008
of patients.|116154003

The clinical presentation|58147004|246105001
of chronic melioidosis|90734009|428111003
is
protean
and
includes|55919000
such presentations|246105001
as chronic skin infection,|177010002|119325001|177010002|39937001|177010002|181469002|90734009|108365000
skin ulcers|46742003
and
lung nodules|196662004
or
chronic pneumonia,|90734009|205237003
closely
mimicking
tuberculosis,|371569005
sometimes
being
called "Vietnamese tuberculosis".|312859007|371569005

Chronic melioidosis|90734009|428111003
can
mimic
tuberculous pericarditis.[56]|67256000

A definitive diagnosis|261002007|439401001|261002007
is
made
by culturing|252398009|61594008
the organism|410653004
from any clinical sample,|58147004|123038009
because
the organism|410653004
is
never part|260726005
of the normal human flora.|23506009|278412004

A definite history|255545003|255545003|392521001
of contact|11723008|70862002
with soil|415555003
may
not
be
elicited|263516000
as melioidosis|428111003
can
be
dormant
for many years|258707000
before manifesting.|250255003

Attention|6769007
should
be
paid
to a history|392521001
of travel|420008001
to endemic areas|42798000
in returned travellers.|7528007

Some authors|308004006
recommend
considering possibility
of melioidosis|428111003
in every febrile patient|386661006|116154003
with a history|392521001
of traveling|420008001
to
and/or
staying
at endemic areas.|42798000

sputum culture,|104173009
urine culture,|275885001
throat swab|258529004
and
culture|252398009|61594008
of any aspirated pus|68052005|11311000|68052005|119323008

should
be
performed|398166005
on all patients|116154003
with suspected melioidosis|428111003|415684004|428111003
(culture|252398009|61594008
on blood agar|87612001|10249006|119273009|10249006
as well as
Ashdown's medium.|255508009

A definitive diagnosis|261002007|439401001|261002007
is
made
by growing _B.

pseudomallei_
from any site.|10546003

A throat swab|258529004
is
not sensitive|83185005
but
is
100% specific|69658003
if positive,|258758003|10828004
and
compares
favourably
with sputum culture.|104173009

The sensitivity|35209006|365705006
of urine culture|275885001
is
increased|35105006|260366006
if
a centrifuged specimen|123038009
is
cultured,|252398009|61594008
and
any bacterial growth|88458008
should
be
reported|229059009|223458004
(
not just growth
above 104 organisms/ml|410653004|259035002
which
is
the usual cut off|283396008
).

Very occasionally,|260358002
bone marrow culture|409655005
may
be
positive|258758003|10828004
in patients|116154003
who
have
negative blood|260385009|87612001|260385009|119273009
cultures|252398009|61594008
for B.

pseudomallei,
but
these
are
not usually
recommended.

A common error|72906007
made
by clinicians
unfamiliar
with melioidosis|428111003
is
to only
send
a specimen|123038009
from the affected site|263583002
(
which
is
the usual procedure|71388002
for most other infections|74964007
)
instead of sending
a full screen.|261015003|20135006|261015003|261015003|360156006

Ashdown's medium,|255508009
a selective medium containing gentamicin,|255508009|42504009|387321007|255508009|42504009|411310000
may
be
required
for cultures|252398009|61594008
taken|419652001
from non-sterile sites.|261029002|10546003|15296000|10546003

_Burkholderia cepacia_ medium|113669008|255508009
may
be
a useful alternative selective medium|255508009
in non-endemic areas,|42798000
where Ashdown's
is
not available.|103328004

A new medium|7147002|255508009
derived
from Ashdown
known|36692007
as Francis medium|255508009
may
help
differentiate|263933003
_B.

pseudomallei_
from _B.

cepacia_
and
may
help
in the early diagnosis|264499004|439401001|264499004
of melioidosis,|428111003
[62]
but
has
not yet
been
extensively clinically
validated.

Many commercial kits|419179001
for identifying bacteria|7882003|409822003
may
misidentify
_B.

pseudomallei_
(_
see|281004000

for a more detailed discussion|242762006|223482009
of these issues|55607006
).

There
is
also
a serological test|68793005
for melioidosis|428111003
(indirect haemagglutination,|255541007|85000002
but
this
is
not commercially available|103328004
in most countries.|223369002

A high background titre|75540009|118590008|371879000|118590008
may
reduce|260400001
the positive predictive value|258758003|10828004
of serological tests|68793005
in endemic countries.|223369002

A specific direct immunofluorescent test|69658003|127796002|269814003|69658003|127796002|69658003|127796002|272393004
and
latex agglutination,|43657008
based|418836005
on monoclonal antibodies,|49616005
are
used|394850002
widely
in Thailand|223594002
but
are
not available elsewhere.|103328004

There
is
almost
complete|255594003
cross-reactivity|65145006|11214006
with _B.

thailandensis_.

There
exists
a commercial ELISA kit|76978006|419179001
for melioidosis|428111003
which
appears
to
perform|398166005
well.|20572008

but
no ELISA test|76978006|269814003|76978006|76978006|272393004
has
yet
been
clinically
validated
as a diagnostic tool.[65]|439401001|86967005|264695004|261004008|86967005|264695004

It
is
not possible to|371930009|60022001
make
the diagnosis|439401001
on imaging studies|363679005|110465008|363679005|224699009|278395004|110465008|278395004|224699009
alone|105529008
(X-rays|52250000|168537006
and
scans
)
,
[66]
but
imaging|363679005|278395004
is
routinely
performed|398166005
to
assess
the full extent|261015003|255590007
of disease.|64572001

Imaging|363679005|278395004
of the abdomen|277112006|52731004|302553009
using|260676000
CT scans|77477000
or
ultrasound|359659005
is
recommended routinely,
as
abscesses|128477000
may
not
be
clinically apparent
and
may
coexist
with disease elsewhere.|64572001

Australian authorities
suggest
imaging|363679005|278395004
of the prostate specifically|263847000|181422007
due to the high incidence|75540009|371879000
of prostatic abscesses|8725005
in northern Australian patients.|116154003

A chest x-ray|399208008
is
also
considered
routine,|50811001
with other investigations|74964007|386053000
as
clinically
indicated.|410535002

The presence|386397008
of honeycomb abscesses|47260009|128477000|227599006|128477000
in the liver|10200004|181268008
are
considered
characteristic,
but
are
not diagnostic.[66][67]|439401001|261004008

The differential diagnosis|47965005
is
extensive|41118005
;
melioidosis|428111003
may
mimic
many other infections,|74964007
including|55919000
tuberculosis.[55]|371569005|264691008

The treatment|276239002|416118004
of melioidosis|428111003
is
divided|422033008
into two stages,|420797005|261612004
an
*
*intravenous high intensity phase|75540009|103370009|21191007|371879000|103370009|21191007|255560000|75540009|103370009|21191007|255560000|371879000|103370009|21191007
*
*
and
an
*
*eradication phase|21191007
*
* to
prevent
recurrence.|246455001

Surgical drainage|83578000|307488001|83578000|122462000
is
usually
indicated|410535002
for prostatic abscesses|8725005
and
septic arthritis,|372938004|372939007
may
be
indicated|410535002
for parotid abscesses|45289007|128477000
and
not usually
indicated|410535002
for hepatosplenic abscesses.|128477000

In bacteraemic melioidosis|5758002|428111003
unresponsive|20646008|422768004
to intravenous antibiotic therapy,|281790008
splenectomy|234319005
has
been
attempted
,
but
there
is
only anecdotal evidence to|50607009|18669006|420295001|18669006
support|9096001|243114000
this practice.[92]

Prior to 1989,
the standard treatment|276239002|416118004
for acute melioidosis|272118002|428111003
was
a three-drug combination|421291004|410942007|89780004
of chloramphenicol,|372777009
co-trimoxazole|398731002
and
doxycycline|372478003
;
this regimen
is
associated|47429007
with a mortality rate|409651001
of 80%
and
is
no longer|255511005
be
used|394850002
unless
no other alternatives|74964007
are
available.|103328004

All four drugs|421534005|410942007
are
bacteriostatic
(
they
stop|422117008
the bacterium|409822003
from growing
but
do
not
kill|248007002
it
)
and
the action|129264002
of co-trimoxazole antagonizes|398731002
both
chloramphenicol|372777009
and
doxycycline.[93]|372478003

Without access|260507000
to appropriate antibiotics|255631004
(principally ceftazidime|387200005
or
meropenem,|387540000
the septicemic form|246176004
of melioidosis|428111003
has
a mortality rate|409651001
that
exceeds
90%.|264705001|264703008

With appropriate antibiotics,|255631004
the mortality rate|409651001
is
about 10%
for uncomplicated cases|263914008|398241000|263914008|413769002
but
up to 80%
for cases|398241000|413769002
with bacteraemia|5758002
or
severe sepsis.|24484000|105592009|24484000|91302008

It
seems
certain|17162000
that access|260507000
to intensive care facilities
is
also important,
and
probably
at least partially|276139006|263796003
explains
why total mortality|258755000|409651001|255619001|409651001
is
20%
in Northern Australia|223621005
but
40%|259031006
in Northeast Thailand.|223594002

Response
to appropriate antibiotic treatment|255631004|276239002|255631004|416118004
is
slow|419443000
with the average duration|103335007
of fever|386661006
following|255260001
treatment|276239002|416118004
being
5?9 days.[10][96]|264706000|258703001|264605009|258703001

Recurrence|246455001
occurs|272120004
in 10
to 20%
of patients.|116154003

While
molecular studies|290005005|110465008|290005005|224699009
have
established|263748003|385645004
that
the majority
of recurrences|246455001
are
due to the original infecting strain,|19535007|48532005|19535007|276768000
a significant proportion|386134007|8212001
of recurrences|246455001
(perhaps
up to a quarter
)
in endemic areas|42798000
may
be
due to reinfection,|255230006
particularly
after 2 years.|260306008|258707000

Risk factors|80943009
include|55919000
severity|272141005
of disease|64572001
(patients|116154003
with positive blood cultures|258758003|30088009|10828004|30088009
or
multifocal disease|524008|64572001
have
a higher risk|15508007
of relapse|263855007|255318003|58184002
)
,
choice
of antibiotic|255631004
for eradication therapy|276239002
(doxycycline monotherapy|372478003
and
fluoroquinolone therapy|276239002
are
not
as effective|255403003|254648000
)
,
poor compliance
with eradication therapy|276239002
and
duration|103335007
of eradication therapy less|276239002
than 8 weeks.[89][98]|258705008

Person-to-person transmission|409699001
is
exceedingly unusual
;[40][41][42]|259031006
and
patients|116154003
with melioidosis|428111003
should
not
be
considered
contagious.
