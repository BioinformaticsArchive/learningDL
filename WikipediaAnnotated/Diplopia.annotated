*Diplopia|24982008
*
*,
commonly
known|36692007
as
*
*double vision|24982008
*
*,
is
the simultaneous perception|251766003
of two images|420797005
of a single|125681006|50607009
object|260787004
that
may
be
displaced|263739008
horizontally,
vertically,
or
diagonally
(i.e.|42146005|22971001

both
vertically
and
horizontally
)
in relation to each other.[[1]]|260305007
(//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diplopia#endnote_Cassin|24982008
)
It
is
usually
the result|394617004
of impaired function|260379002|246464006|40226000|246464006
of the extraocular muscles (EOM's),|67833000
where
both
eyes|81745001
are
still functional|40143009|246464006
but
they
cannot
converge
to
target
the desired object.|260787004

Problems|55607006
with EOM's
may
be
due to mechanical problems,|261018001|55607006
disorders|64572001
of the neuromuscular junction,|31627007
disorders|64572001
of the cranial nerves|25238003
(III,|257471003
IV,
and
VI|262261009
that
stimulate
the muscles,|91727004
and
occasionally disorders|64572001
involving|248448006
the supranuclear oculomotor pathways
or
ingestion|111984006
of toxins.[2]|80917008

Diplopia|24982008
is
often|70232002
one|421379005
of the first signs|276131009
of a systemic disease,|264578000
particularly
to a muscular|91727004|263816006
or
neurological process,|1199008|415178003
[3]|260313008
and
it
may
disrupt
a person?s balance,|125676002|249982003|125676002|78933003|125676002|282295000
movement,|255324009
and/or
reading abilities.[1][4]|309250007

Binocular diplopia|246655008
is
double vision arising|24982008|68727004
as a result|394617004
of the misalignment|399898009
of the two eyes|420797005|81745001
relative|125677006|29920004
to each other,
such as
occurs|272120004
in esotropia|16596007
or
exotropia.|399054005

In such
a case|398241000
while
the fovea|67046006|264479005
of one eye|421379005|81745001|421379005|244486005
is
directed|255589003
at the object|260787004
of regard,
the fovea|67046006|264479005
of the other|74964007
is
directed elsewhere,|255589003
and
the image
of the object|260787004
of regard
falls|1912002
on an extra-foveal area|67046006|42798000|264479005|42798000
of the retina.|5665001|181171005

The brain|12738006|258335003
calculates|258090004
the 'visual direction'|255374006|260672003
of an object|260787004
based|418836005
upon the position|246449006
of its image
relative|125677006|29920004
to the fovea.|67046006|264479005

Images
falling|1912002
on the fovea|67046006|264479005
are
seen
as
being
directly ahead,
while
those falling|1912002
on retina|5665001|181171005
outside the fovea|67046006|264479005
may
be
seen
as above,|261183002
below,
right|24028007
or
left|7771000
of straight ahead|262185006
depending
upon the area|42798000
of retina|5665001|181171005
stimulated.

Thus,
when
the eyes|81745001
are
misaligned
,
the brain|12738006|258335003
will
perceive|81742003
two images|420797005
of one target object,|421379005|260787004
as
the target
object|260787004
simultaneously|79970003
stimulates
different, non-corresponding, retinal areas|263735002|5665001|42798000|263735002|103067001|42798000
in
either
eye,|81745001|244486005
thus
producing
double vision.|24982008

This correlation
of particular areas|42798000
of the retina|5665001|181171005
in one eye|421379005|81745001|421379005|244486005
with the same areas|262126009|42798000
in the other|74964007
is
known|36692007
as retinal correspondence.|251759004

This relationship also|272151006
gives|419582001
rise
to an associated phenomenon|47429007
of binocular diplopia,|246655008
although
one|421379005
that
is
rarely|103356009
noted
by those experiencing diplopia|24982008
:
Because
the fovea|67046006|264479005
of one eye|421379005|81745001|421379005|244486005
corresponds
to the fovea|67046006|264479005
of the other, images|74964007
falling|1912002
on the two foveas|420797005|67046006|420797005|264479005
are
'projected'
to the same point|262126009
in space.

Thus,
when
the eyes|81745001
are
misaligned
,
the brain|12738006|258335003
will
'
project
' two different images|420797005|263735002
in the same visual direction.|262126009|255374006|260672003

This phenomenon
is
known|36692007
as 'confusion'.|286933003

The brain naturally|12738006|258335003
guards|250072004
against double vision.|24982008

In an attempt to
avoid
double vision,|24982008
the brain|12738006|258335003
can
sometimes
ignore
the image
from one eye|421379005|81745001|421379005|244486005
;
a process|415178003
known|36692007
as suppression.|80633008|258761002

The ability to|371150009
suppress|245780008
is
to
be
found|404684003
particularly
in childhood|68433009
when
the brain|12738006|258335003
is
still
developing.

Thus,
those
with childhood strabismus almost never|68433009|22066006
complain
of diplopia|24982008
while
adults|133936004
who
develop
strabismus almost always|22066006
do.

While
this ability to|371150009
suppress|245780008
might
seem
an entirely positive adaptation|258758003|60783002|258758003|4452006|10828004|60783002|10828004|4452006
to strabismus,|22066006
in the developing child|410601007|160499008
this
can
prevent
the proper development|278923009
of vision|281004000
in the affected eye|247591002|81745001|247591002|244486005|248448006|81745001|248448006|244486005
resulting|42752001
in amblyopia.|387742006

Some adults|133936004
are
also able to|371150009
suppress|245780008
their diplopia,|24982008
but
their suppression|80633008|258761002
is
rarely|103356009
as deep|131197000
or
as effective|255403003|254648000
and
takes|419652001
longer to|255511005
establish|263748003
,
and
thus
they
are
not at risk|30207005
of permanently
compromising
their vision.|281004000

Hence,
in some cases diplopia|398241000|24982008|413769002|24982008
disappears
without medical intervention,|74188005|225334002
but
in other cases|74964007|398241000|74964007|413769002
the cause|134198009
of the double vision|24982008
may
still
be
present.|52101004|246105001

More rarely,|242762006|103356009
diplopia|24982008
can
also
occur|272120004
when
viewing|246516004
with only one eye|50607009|421379005|81745001|50607009|421379005|244486005|420295001|421379005|81745001|420295001|421379005|244486005
;
this
is
called
*
*monocular diplopia|50446000
*
*,
or
,
where
the patient|116154003
perceives|81742003
more
than two images,|420797005
*
*monocular polyopia|50446000
*
*.

In this case,|398241000
the differential diagnosis|47965005
of multiple image perception|260396001|81742003
includes|55919000
the consideration
of such
conditions|78326006|260905004
as corneal surface keratoconus,|314853007|65636009
subluxation|263031003
of the lens,|78076003|181169005
a structural defect|6920004
within the eye,|81745001|244486005
a lesion
in the anterior visual cortex|255549009
(rarely|103356009
cause|23981006|134198009
diplopia,|24982008
more commonly polyopia|242762006|50446000
or
palinopsia|25462005
or
non-organic conditions.|260905004

Temporary diplopia|14803004|24982008
can
be
caused|23981006|134198009
by alcohol intoxication|25702006
or
head injuries,|82271004
such as concussion.|81371004

If temporary double vision|14803004|24982008
does
not
resolve
quickly,
one|421379005
should
see|281004000
an ophthalmologist immediately.|422234006|49499008

It
can
also
be
a side effect
of the anti-epileptic drugs Phenytoin|387220006
and
Zonisamide,|125693002
and
the anti-convulsant drug Lamotrigine,|410942007|387562000
as well as
the hypnotic drug Zolpidem|321088006|387569009
and
the dissociative drugs Ketamine|410942007|373464007
and
Dextromethorphan.|387114001

Temporary diplopia|14803004|24982008
can
also
be
caused|23981006|134198009
by tired|224960004
and/or
strained eye muscles|48532005|67833000
or
voluntarily.

If diplopia|24982008
appears
with other symptoms|74964007
such as fatigue|84229001
and
acute|272118002
or
chronic pain,|82423001
the patient|116154003
should
see|281004000
a doctor immediately.|309343006|49499008

Some people|125676002
are
able to consciously|371150009
uncouple
their eyes,|81745001
either
by over|21481007
focussing|251776000
closely
(i.e.|42146005|22971001

going
cross eyed|16596007
)
or
unfocusing.

Also,
while
looking|386548000
at one object|421379005|260787004
behind another object,|260787004
the foremost object's image|260787004
is
doubled|1305003
(
for example,
placing|257557008
one's finger|421379005|7569003|421379005|302541005
in
between one's face|421379005|89545001|421379005|302549007
while
reading text|50360004
on a computer monitor|13288007
).

In this sense double vision|106148006|24982008
is
neither dangerous
nor
harmful,
and
may
even
be
enjoyable.

It
makes
viewing stereograms possible.[5]|246516004|371930009|246516004|60022001

Diplopia|24982008
has
a diverse range
of ophthalmologic, infectious, autoimmune, neurological,|394594003|263680009|1199008|239005|263680009|1199008
and
neoplastic causes.|108369006|134198009

The appropriate treatment|276239002|416118004
for binocular diplopia|246655008
will
depend
upon the cause|134198009
of the condition|260905004
producing
the symptoms.

Efforts|19487008
must
first|255216001|232714002
be
made
to
identify|7882003
and
treat|395077000
the underlying cause|134198009
of the problem.|55607006

Treatment options|276239002|416118004
include|55919000
eye exercises,|225702009
[1]|260305007
wearing
an eye patch|81745001|1522000|81745001|262302002|81745001|385114002|81745001|386028003|81745001|413676000|81745001|421043009|244486005|1522000|244486005|262302002|244486005|385114002|244486005|386028003|244486005|413676000|244486005|421043009
on alternative eyes,|81745001
[1] prism correction,|260305007
[8]
and
in more extreme situations,|242762006|12565001
surgery[4]|83578000
or
botulinum toxin.[9]|419254007|404909007
