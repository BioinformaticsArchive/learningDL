*Hereditary elliptocytosis|191169008
*
*,
also
known|36692007
as ovalocytosis,|191169008|250242004
is
an inherited blood disorder|255404009|34093004
in which
an abnormally large number|255509001|410680006|255509001|410681005
of the patient's erythrocytes|116154003|14089001|116154003|41898006
(i.e.|42146005|22971001

red blood cells|14089001|41898006|258759006|126242007
)
are
elliptical
rather than
the typical biconcave disc shape.|107644003|246176004|300842002

It
is
one|421379005
of many red-cell membrane defects.|386713009|53982002|6920004|371240000|53982002|6920004

In its severe forms,|24484000|246176004
this disorder predisposes|64572001
to haemolytic anaemia.|61261009

In camelids,
elliptocytosis|191169008|250242004
is
normal.|17621005|258744000

Elliptocytosis|191169008|250242004
was
first|255216001|232714002
described
in 1904,
[1]|260305007
and
was
first|255216001|232714002
recognised
as a hereditary condition|255404009|260905004
in 1932.

More recently|242762006|6493001
it
has
become
clear|263707001
that
the severity|272141005
of the condition|260905004
is
highly variable,[3]|75540009|255372005
and
there
is
much genetic variability|3950001|255372005|255395001|255372005
amongst those affected.[4]|247591002|248448006

The incidence
of hereditary elliptocytosis|191169008
is
hard to|72505002
determine
,
as
many sufferers
of the milder|255604002
forms|246176004
of the disorder|64572001
are
asymptomatic|84387000
and
their condition never|260905004
comes
to medical attention.|74188005|6769007

Around 90%|264705001|264703008
of those with this disorder|20401003|64572001|421463005|64572001
are
thought|88952004
to
fall|1912002
into the asymptomatic population.|84387000|385436007|84387000|389109008

It
is
estimated|414135002
that
its incidence
is
between 3|260313008
and
5
per 10,000
in the USA,|223688001
[5]|264706000|264605009
and
that
those
of African|413464008
and
Mediterranean descent
are
of higher risk.|15508007

Because
it
can
confer
resistance|30714006
to malaria,|248437004
some subtypes|260837004
of hereditary elliptocytosis|191169008
are
significantly more prevalent
in regions|410673009
where malaria|248437004
is
endemic.

For example,
in equatorial Africa|223498002
its incidence
is
estimated|414135002
at 60-160
per 10,
000,
[6]
and
in Malayan|1340002
natives|263818007
its incidence
is
1500-2000
per 10,000.

Almost all
forms|246176004
of hereditary elliptocytosis|191169008
are
autosomal dominant,|263681008
and
both sexes|258139002|365952006|263495000|70256003|57312000
are
therefore
at equal risk|9726003|30207005
of
having
the condition.|260905004

The most important exception|4757001
to this rule|10828004
of autosomal dominance|263681008
is
for a subtype|260837004
of hereditary elliptocytosis|191169008
called
hereditary pyropoikilocytosis (HPP),|9434008
which
is
autosomal recessive.|258211005

There
are
three major forms|421291004|255603008|246176004
of hereditary elliptocytosis|191169008
:
common hereditary elliptocytosis,|72906007|191169008
spherocytic elliptocytosis|191169008|250242004
and
southeast Asian ovalocytosis.|186044009|191169008|186044009|250242004

Common hereditary elliptocytosis|72906007|191169008
is
the most common form|4757001|72906007|246176004
of elliptocytosis,|191169008|250242004
and
the form most extensively|246176004
researched.

Even
when
looking|386548000
only
at this form|246176004
of elliptocytosis,|191169008|250242004
there
is
a high degree|75540009|258395000|75540009|246173007|371879000|258395000|371879000|246173007
of variability|255372005
in the clinical severity|58147004|272141005
of its subtypes.|260837004

A clinically significant haemolytic anaemia|386134007|61261009
occurs|272120004
only
in 5-10%|264706000|264605009
of sufferers,
with a strong bias|260404005
towards those with more severe subtypes|20401003|24484000|260837004|421463005|24484000|260837004
of the disorder.|64572001

Southeast Asian ovalocytosis|186044009|191169008|186044009|250242004
and
spherocytic elliptocytosis|191169008|250242004
are
less common subtypes predominantly|276139006|72906007|260837004|263796003|72906007|260837004
affecting|247591002|248448006
those
of south-east Asian|186044009
and
European ethnic groups,|414152003|397731000|397731000
respectively.

The following categorisation|255260001|73504009
of the disorder|64572001
demonstrates
its heterogeneity[8]
:

A number|410680006|410681005
of genes|67271001
have
been
linked
to common hereditary elliptocytosis|72906007|191169008
(many|260396001
involve|248448006
the same gene|262126009|67271001
as forms|246176004
of Hereditary spherocytosis,|55995005
or
HS
)
:

These mutations|55446002
have
a common end result|72906007|261782000|394617004|72906007|422117008|394617004
;
they
destabilise
the cytoskeletal scaffold|25680008
of cells.|4421005

This stability|58158008
is
especially important
in erythrocytes|14089001|41898006
as
they
are
constantly
under the influence
of deforming shear forces.|64973003|8061008

As disc-shaped erythrocytes|107644003|14089001|107644003|41898006|300842002|14089001|300842002|41898006
pass
through capillaries,|20982000
which
can
be
2-3|260306008
micrometres|258674000
wide,|90522003
they
are
forced|263760002
to
assume
an elliptical shape|107644003|246176004|300842002
in order to
fit|91175000|102499006
through.

Normally,
this deformation lasts only
as long|255511005
as a cell|4421005|362837007
is
present|52101004|246105001
in a capillary,|20982000|255416003
but
in hereditary elliptocytosis|191169008
the instability|410728007
of the cytoskeleton means|62337001|255586005
that erythrocytes|14089001|41898006
deformed
by passing|223647001
through a capillary|20982000|255416003
are
forever
rendered
elliptical.

These elliptical cells|4421005
are
taken|419652001
up
by the spleen|78961009|181279003
and
removed|127485006
from circulation|413854007
when
they
are
younger|84422007
than they
would
normally
be
,
meaning|255586005
that
the erythrocytes|14089001|41898006
of people|125676002
with hereditary elliptocytosis|191169008
have
a shorter|359530003|367450005
than average life-span|224130005
(
a normal person's erythrocytes average 120 days|17621005|125676002|14089001|258703001|17621005|125676002|41898006|258703001|258744000|125676002|14089001|258703001|258744000|125676002|41898006|258703001
or
more
).

Inheritance|246071007
of multiple mutations|260396001|55446002
tends
to infer more serious disease.|42745003|64572001

For instance,
the most common genotype|4757001|72906007
responsible|394851003
for HPP|9434008
occurs|272120004
when
the affected individual|247591002|125676002|247591002|385435006|248448006|125676002|248448006|385435006
inherits|255404009
an ?-spectrin mutation|36445004|55446002
from one parent|421379005|40683002
(i.e.|42146005|22971001

one parent|421379005|40683002
has
hereditary elliptocytosis|191169008
)
and
the other parent passes|74964007|40683002
on an
as-
yet-undefined defect|6920004
that
causes|134198009
the affected individual's cells|247591002|125676002|4421005|247591002|385435006|4421005|248448006|125676002|4421005|248448006|385435006|4421005
to preferentially
produce
the defective ?-spectrin|36445004
rather than
normal ?-spectrin.|17621005|36445004|258744000|36445004

The diagnosis|439401001
of hereditary elliptocytosis|191169008
is
usually
made
by coupling
a family history|57177007
of the condition|260905004
with an appropriate clinical presentation|58147004|246105001
and
confirmation|74996004
on a blood smear.|87612001|119273009

In general|60132005
it
requires
that
at least 25%|276139006|263796003
of erythrocytes|14089001|41898006
in the specimen|123038009
are
abnormally elliptical
in shape,|107644003|246176004|300842002
though
the observed percentage|118582008
of elliptocytes|45028007
can
be
100%.

This
is
in contrast
to the rest|258157001
of the population,|385436007|389109008
in which
it
is
common|72906007
for
up to 15%
of erythrocytes to|14089001|41898006
be
elliptical.[10]

If
some doubt remains
regarding
the diagnosis,|439401001
definitive diagnosis|261002007|439401001|261002007
can
involve|248448006
osmotic fragility testing,|113039000|113039000|272393004|272393004
an autohaemolysis test,|269814003|272393004
and
direct protein assaying|255589003|88878007|58779000|255589003|88878007|272392009
by gel electrophoresis.[11]|385100002|814007

The vast majority
of those with hereditary elliptocytosis|20401003|191169008|421463005|191169008
require
no treatment whatsoever.|276239002|416118004

They
have
a mildly increased risk|255604002|35105006|30207005|255604002|260366006|30207005
of developing gallstones,|266474003|256896000|235919008
which
is
treated surgically|28995006|83578000
with a cholecystectomy|38102005
if
pain|22253000
becomes
problematic.

Folate
helps
to
reduce|260400001
the extent|255590007
of haemolysis|418983006|404227002|73320003
in those with significant haemolysis|20401003|386134007|418983006|20401003|386134007|404227002|20401003|386134007|73320003|421463005|386134007|418983006|421463005|386134007|404227002|421463005|386134007|73320003
due to hereditary elliptocytosis.|191169008

Because
the spleen|78961009|181279003
breaks
down old|70753007
and
worn-out blood cells,|60119000|63370004
those individuals|125676002|385435006
with more severe forms|242762006|24484000|246176004
of hereditary elliptocytosis|191169008
can
have
a splenomegaly,|16294009
spenectomy
can
be
performed|398166005
in case|398241000
that
their situation
may
cause|23981006|134198009
a worsening|230993007|231877006
of the signs|72670004
and
symptoms
of their anaemia.|271737000

These
can
include|55919000
:

Removal|118292001|128303001
of the spleen|78961009|181279003
(splenectomy|234319005
is
effective|255403003|254648000
in reducing|260400001
the severity|272141005
of these complications,|116223007
but
is
associated|47429007
with an increased risk|35105006|30207005|260366006|30207005
of overwhelming bacterial septicaemia,|10001005
and
is
only
performed|398166005
on those with significant complications.|20401003|386134007|116223007|421463005|386134007|116223007

Because
many neonates|260396001|133933007
with severe elliptocytosis|24484000|191169008|24484000|250242004
progress|385651009
to
have
only
a mild disease,|255604002|64572001
and
because
this age group|424144002|261586004|424144002|160481000|424144002|389109008
is
particularly susceptible|131196009
to pneumococcal infections,|16814004
a splenectomy|234319005
is
only
performed|398166005
on those under 5 years old|261089000|258707000|70753007
when
it
is
absolutely necessary.

Because
chronic haemolysis|90734009|418983006|90734009|404227002|90734009|73320003
increases|260366006
an individual's risk|125676002|30207005|385435006|30207005
of gallstones,|266474003|256896000|235919008
people|125676002
with elliptocytosis|191169008|250242004
have
an increased risk|35105006|30207005|260366006|30207005
of suffering
from gallstones.|266474003|256896000|235919008

This risk|30207005
is
relative|125677006|29920004
to the severity|272141005
of the disease,|64572001
and
those
with symptomatic elliptocytosis|264931009|191169008|264931009|250242004
should
have
regular abdominal ultrasounds to|17854005|277112006|359659005
monitor|13288007
the progression|246453008|246450006
of their gall bladder disease.|39621005

Those with hereditary elliptocytosis|20401003|191169008|421463005|191169008
have
a good prognosis,|170968001
only
those
with very severe disease|260358002|24484000|64572001
have
a shortened life expectancy.|359530003|224130005|410517006
