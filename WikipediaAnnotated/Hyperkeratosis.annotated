(
from Ancient Greek|1451003
: ????
(hyper,|44548000
?over?|21481007
)
; keratos - keratin|259987000|102665003
)
is
thickening|263899003
of the stratum corneum,|20281003
often|70232002
associated|47429007
with a qualitative abnormality|26716007|276654001
of the keratin,|259987000|102665003
[1]|260305007
and
also usually
accompanied
by an increase|260366006
in the granular layer.|49874001

As the corneum|28726007|181162001
layer
normally
varies
greatly
in thickness|246703001
in different sites,|263735002|10546003
some experience
is
needed to|410525008|103325001
assess
minor degrees|410599005|246173007|255606000|246173007
of hyperkeratosis.|396228006

It
can
be
caused|23981006|134198009
by vitamin A deficiency|72000004
or
chronic exposure|90734009|71677004|90734009|24932003
to arsenic.|413576005

It
can
be
treated|28995006
with urea-containing creams,|64891007|42504009
which
dissolve|421682005
the intercellular matrix
of the cells|4421005
of the stratum corneum,|20281003
promoting
desquamation|271767006
of scaly skin,|271761007
eventually
resulting|42752001
in softening|35828005
of hyperkeratotic areas.[2]|255424008|42798000

_Follicular hyperkeratosis_ dass|238629004|49471004
(also
called
"Phrynoderma"|238629004
)
is
a skin condition|422000003
characterized
by excessive development|260378005|278923009
of keratin|259987000|102665003
in hair follicles,|67290009
resulting|42752001
in rough, cone-shaped, elevated papules.|67540009|107644003|75540009|443871003|67540009|300842002|75540009|443871003|69059007|107644003|75540009|443871003|69059007|300842002|75540009|443871003

The openings|56116003
are
often|70232002
closed|29179001
with a white plug|413773004|303480007|185984009|303480007|371251000|303480007
of encrusted sebum.|51280008

This condition|260905004
has
been
shown
in several small-scale|261028005|255507004|19892000|261028005|255507004|278111002
studies|110465008|224699009
to
respond
well|20572008
to supplementation
with vitamins|87708000
and
fats|256674009
rich|224166006
in essential fatty acids.|34325006|31979005

Some research
suggests
this
is
due mainly|42752001
to E
and
B vitamins.|103069003

Vitamin A|82622003
is
also
listed
as
connected
to the pathology.[4]|394595002
