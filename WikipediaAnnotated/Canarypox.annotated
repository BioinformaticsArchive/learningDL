and
etiologic agent|134198009|260872001
of
*
*canarypox|56005007|51521006

*,
a disease|64572001
of wild|262290003
and
captive birds|387972009
that
can
cause|23981006|134198009
significant losses.|386134007

Canarypox|56005007|51521006
can
enter|417985001
human cells,|250436000
but
it
cannot
survive
and
multiply|421206002
in human cells.|250436000

There
is
a live viral vaccine|419749002|418310008
available|103328004
which
may
have
beneficial properties|370130000|116685008
against human cancer|278412004|363346000|278412004|372087000
when
used|394850002
as a mammalian expression vector.|387976007|10012005|260529001

(ATCvet code
:
QI01KD01.

Furthermore,
the POXIMUNE?
C vaccine|398827000
does
offer|410527000
direct protection|255589003
against CNPV
in susceptible birds.[3]|131196009|387972009

Generally CNPV
is
considered
a disease|64572001
of songbirds|444892007
for example,
canaries,|396523001
magpies|423790006
and
nightingales
and
is
associated|47429007
with higher mortality rates|75540009|409651001|371879000|409651001
when
compared
to other avian pox viruses.|74964007|58816007

In some instances,
mortality|409651001
approaches|103379005
100%.

Avian pox viruses also|58816007
cause|23981006|134198009
significant economic losses|386134007
in domestic poultry|261770009|359839008|261770009|28230009
and
remains
a problem|55607006
in the conservation
of endemic bird species inhabiting islands.[5]|387972009|69658003|288560006

The general symptoms|267022002
of CNPV
are
similar
to other species|74964007|69658003
of avian pox viruses|58816007
and
are
characterised
by pustules|271760008
and
diphtheria|397428000
or
pneumonia|205237003
like symptoms.[1]

Canarypox virus (CNPV)|51521006
is
a member|394852005
of the _Poxviridae_ family.|424976006|35359004

Canarypox viruses,|51521006
as
with other bird pox viruses|74964007|58816007
are
in the genera|18511007
of _Avipoxvirus_.|58816007

Nine other species|422113007|69658003
are
also
in the genus _Avipoxvirus._|58816007
These
include|55919000
:
Fowlpox virus,|33150006
Juncopox virus,|7069007
Mynahpox virus,|44449006
Psittacinepox virus,|80759002
Sparrowpox virus,|63488006
Starlingpox virus,|63172000
Pigeonpox virus,|29225001
Turkeypox virus|46881007
and
Quailpox virus.[6]|5911003

It
has
thus far|46053002
been
reported|229059009|223458004
that
around 232 bird species|387972009|69658003
(
from 23 disparate orders|264657009
)
are
affected|247591002|248448006
by avian pox virus.[7]|58816007

CNPV
is
an enveloped virus.|49872002

This
can
be
enveloped
by double|1305003
(external enveloped virion- EEV|261074009|285296008
)
or
single|125681006|50607009
(intracellular mature virion ? IMV|83167003|34071009|285296008
)
membranes.|83097008

These membranes|83097008
are
acquired|255396000
from the host cells endoplasmic reticulum (ER)|4421005|33761008
or
cell membrane.|53982002

The Poxvirus family|424976006|35359004
are
characterised
by
having
exceptionally large physical dimensions,|255509001|5880005|255506008|255509001|19388002|255506008
approximately 330nm?280nm?200nm.[6]|26175008

The genome|18470003
of CNPV
is
linear|50009006
and
is
composed
of dsDNA.|13925004

The genome size|18470003|277049003
is
approximately 365kbp|26175008
and
in total,|258755000|255619001
328 genes|67271001
have
been
found.|404684003

The shape|107644003|246176004|300842002
of all poxviruses|424976006
resembles
something
of a 'rounded brick'|42700002
and
remains
determined
by the specific envelope|69658003
around the virus.[9]|49872002

The process|415178003
which further|46053002
characterises
the poxvirus family|424976006|35359004
is
that replication|74256009
occurs|272120004
in the cytoplasm
and
utilises
a specific virus|69658003|49872002|69658003
made
structure
for replication,|74256009
the 'virosome'.[10]

Furthermore,
gene expression|89551006
is
divided|422033008
into three phases|421291004|272108007
:
early,|264499004
intermediate|11896004
and
late.|260383002

At each
stage|21191007|371508000|261612004
specific genes|69658003|67271001
and
promoters
are
expressed.

The structure
and
replication|74256009
of CNPV
is
similar
to other members|74964007|394852005
of the _Poxviridae_ family.|424976006|35359004

The vaccinia virus|13126002
is
commonly
used|394850002
as a prototype
and
can
be
consulted|11429006
for further information.|46053002

The most common form|4757001|72906007|246176004
of
spread|410677005
of CNPV
is
by vectors|260529001
such as mosquitoes|359768004
and
mites.|84073006

These transmit|60117003
the virus|49872002
from infected birds|387972009
to non-infected birds.|55189008|387972009

Direct routes|255589003
of transmission|258150004
have
also
been
observed
,
especially
in closed environments|29179001|276339004
such as aviaries
or
farms,|224816003
where
the contact rate|11723008|70862002
of birds|387972009
is
high.[13]|75540009|371879000

When
the virus|49872002
is
transmitted directly,|60117003|258150004
this
would
usually
occur|272120004
through aerosols,|64242006|52262001
consumption
of infected bird tissue|387972009|85756007
or
by general contact|60132005|11723008|60132005|70862002
with the diseased bird.|64572001|387972009

Healthy birds|263775005|387972009
are
at increased risk|35105006|30207005|260366006|30207005
of acquiring|255396000
the disease|64572001
through existing wounds|13924000
or
scabs|69640009
when
in close contact|29179001|11723008|29179001|70862002
with diseased birds.[1]|64572001|387972009

The typical incubation period|406646006
for the virus|49872002
is
between 5-10 days.[14]|264706000|258703001|264605009|258703001

CNPV symptoms often|70232002
show
two main forms.|420797005|63161005|246176004

That
is
either
dry|13880007
(cutaneous|119325001|39937001|181469002
and/or
wet|17461003
(diphtheritic|397428000
)
symptoms
(
both
forms|246176004
can
occur|272120004
at the same time|262126009|410669006
).[12]

The dry form|13880007|246176004
is
the most frequently|4757001|70232002
observed.

At the beginning|255395001
of the disease,|64572001
small white/yellow blisters|255507004|413773004|263935005|408764000|255507004|413773004|263935005|247464001|255507004|185984009|263935005|408764000|255507004|185984009|263935005|247464001|255507004|371251000|263935005|408764000|255507004|371251000|263935005|247464001
form|246176004
on the uncovered parts|255368006|260726005
of the skin.|119325001|39937001|181469002

As the disease|64572001
progresses|385651009
blisters|408764000|247464001
get
progressively larger|255509001|263768009
and
form nodules|246176004|27925004|246176004|279365004
where the virus|49872002
can
multiply.|421206002

When
the nodules|27925004|279365004
coalesce
and
burst,|255331008
scabs|69640009
are
formed|35810008
leaving|7771000|90737002
rough, dry|13880007
and
pigmented areas|300597003|42798000
on the skin|119325001|39937001|181469002
where the nodules|27925004|279365004
were.[12]

This form|246176004
of the disease|64572001
is
usually mild|255604002
and
does
not
cause|23981006|134198009
death.|419620001|268923008

The chances
of mortality increase|409651001|260366006
when
the dry form|13880007|246176004
occurs|272120004
together with the wet|17461003
(diphtheritic|397428000
)
form.|246176004

The wet form symptoms|17461003|246176004
include|55919000
an enlarged thymus|260376009|9875009|118452000|9875009
and
obstructed lungs,|263821009|39607008
sinuses|2095001
and
trachea|44567001|181213009
with white areas|413773004|42798000|185984009|42798000|371251000|42798000
of necrotic tissue.|6574001|85756007

This results|394617004
in restricted air intake|263856008|417696007
and
the potential|30207005
for suffocation.|66466001

It
has
also
been
observed
that
some birds|387972009
may
also
experience
thickened eye-lids,|263899003|80243003
air-sacks|417696007
and
enlarged spleens.[15]|16294009

Observations|103705002
under the microscope|65473004
have
shown
that
the lesions
are
characterised
by epithelial proliferation|62234006
and
hypertrophy|56246009
in the viral infected areas.|42798000

Characteristics
of avian pox|387972009
include|55919000
the formation|11798007|255277001
of intracytoplasmic inclusion bodies|29015002
('Bollinger bodies'|279495008|123037004
)
which
are
composed
of mononuclear inflammatory cells|256923004
and
have
been
detected|260373001
in the thymus,|9875009
spleen,|78961009|181279003
bone marrow,|279729006
middle ear|25342003|181185000
and
air sac.|49081009

Similar inclusion bodies|279495008|123037004
which
are
associated|47429007
with inflammation|257552002
have
also
been
seen
in the epidermis,|55988001
feather follicles,|68922000
sinuses|2095001
and
oral mucosa lining.[16]|113277000|50009006

Apart from the symptoms
mentioned
above, more general signs|261183002|60132005|72670004
of infection
include|55919000
weight loss,|89362005
loss
of feathers|23336004
and
scaly skin|271761007
on the head,|69536005|302548004
neck|45048000|302550007
and
back.

Secondary bacterial infections|2603003|301811001|81170007|301811001
are
common|72906007
with
both
forms|246176004
of the disease,|64572001
having
the potential to|30207005
cause|23981006|134198009
pneumonia|205237003
or
other bacterial infections
at the sites|10546003
of blistering.[1]|408764000|247464001

Currently there|15240007
is
no treatment available.[14]|276239002|103328004|416118004|103328004

Diseased birds|64572001|387972009
should
however
be
admitted|32485007
to a veterinary practice|53216000
where suitable care
will
be
provided.

Care
would
normally
consist
of removing skin|127485006|119325001|127485006|39937001|127485006|181469002
from the lesions
and
washing
the infected area|42798000
(s)
with Lugol's iodine solution.|42146005|44588005|8537005|77899000|34654009

Furthermore,
swabbing|257261003
of the mouth|74262004|123851003|21082005|181220002
and
throat areas to|54066008|42798000|49928004|42798000|264231000|42798000
remove|127485006
necrotic tissues|6574001|85756007
is
common.[12]|72906007

By keeping diseased birds|64572001|387972009
in warmer temperatures|71384000|246508008
and
ensuring daily eye rinsing|69620002|81745001|69620002|244486005
with 1-2% saline solution|303183002|373757009
has
also
been
shown
to
promote
recovery.

In some cases,|398241000|413769002
the infected birds|387972009
are
prescribed
antibiotics.|255631004

This
will
not
target
the virus|49872002
but
its use|277889008|419385000
is
designed to
prevent
secondary bacterial|2603003|409822003|81170007|409822003
and
fungal infections|3218000
which
are
often|70232002
found|404684003
in skin lesions.[1]|95324001

A live attenuated CNPV vaccine|419749002|24588000|398827000
has
been
developed
and
is
the best preventive measure|20572008|262073000|246445000|20572008|262073000|272391002|20572008|129428001|246445000|20572008|129428001|272391002|3442003|262073000|246445000|3442003|262073000|272391002|3442003|129428001|246445000|3442003|129428001|272391002
against canarypox|56005007|51521006
for captive grown canary birds|396523001|387972009|396524007|387972009
and
other passerine birds.|74964007|387972009

The brand name 'Poximune? C'
by Ceva
is
a freeze-dried vaccine,|48103003|257791009|398827000|48103003|13880007|398827000
administered|418283001
by the 'wing web' method|53036007|260686004|53036007|272394005
to healthy, susceptible passerine birds|263775005|131196009|387972009
who
have
reached|282679008
at least four weeks|276139006|421534005|258705008|263796003|421534005|258705008
of age.|424144002

Booster vaccination|359953009
is
recommended
every 6-12 months|260274009|258706009
if
the risk|30207005
of disease|64572001
remains
high.|75540009|371879000

Pox lesion formation|11798007|255277001
around the vaccination area|42798000
is
indicative
that
the vaccine|398827000
has
been
effective.|255403003|254648000

The vaccine|398827000
should
not
be
administered|418283001
during egg production|102263004|263828003
or
in the 4 weeks|260308009|258705008

CNPV
has
been
used|394850002
recently|6493001
as a mammalian expression vector|387976007|10012005|260529001
in the vaccine industry.|398827000

Although
veterinary CNPV vaccines|53216000|398827000
exist
,
recent attention|6493001|6769007
has
focussed|87017008|363702006
on its use|277889008|419385000
in human medicine|278412004|410942007
with several human vaccines|261028005|278412004|398827000
using|260676000
this expression system|10012005|246333005
undergoing

The expression system|10012005|246333005
using|260676000
CNPV
is
advantageous
because
it
undergoes
what
is
known|36692007
as ?abortive infection?
but
at the same time|262126009|410669006
displays
the necessary antigens|7120007
to the hosts immune system.[8]|116003000

Canarypox virus|51521006
remains
a constant threat
to wild birds.|33964005

Those most vulnerable|4757001
are
passerine birds,|387972009
endemic
on islands|288560006
such as Hawaii|224049006
and
the Galapagos.

Here
they
have
experienced
dramatic losses
in bird numbers.|387972009|410680006|387972009|410681005

Many more|242762006
have
become
classified|73504009
as endangered species|69658003
due to CNPV.

The disease|64572001
is
mainly
spread|410677005
by mosquitoes|359768004
and
mites|84073006
in these regions,|410673009
which
were
introduced|127487003
during European colonisation.|414152003

Canarypox,|56005007|51521006
together with avian malaria,|1498006
are
the most devastating diseases|4757001|64572001
for birds|387972009
on the island|288560006
of Hawaii|224049006
and
surrounding regions.[19]|355648006|410673009
