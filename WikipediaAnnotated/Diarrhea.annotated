(
or

)
(
from the Greek ????????,|1451003
??? _dia_ "|128787000
through" + ??? _rheo_ "flow" meaning "
flowing
through"[2]|260306008
)
is
the condition|260905004
of
having
three|421291004
or
more loose|242762006|78799005
or
liquid bowel movements|33463005|111989001|264312008|111989001
per day.|258703001|259032004

It
is
a common cause|72906007|134198009
of death|419620001|268923008
in developing countries|223369002
and
the second most common cause|81170007|72906007|134198009|257997001|72906007|134198009|288495006|72906007|134198009
of infant deaths worldwide.|160956009

The loss
of fluids|32457005|33463005
through diarrhea|398032003
can
cause|23981006|134198009
dehydration|34095006
and
electrolyte disturbances|105593004
such as potassium deficiency|43339004
or
other salt imbalances.|74964007|387390002

In 2009 diarrhea|398032003
was
estimated|414135002
to
have
caused|23981006|134198009
1.1 million deaths|260305007|419620001|260305007|268923008
in people|125676002
aged|424144002|105436006
5
and
over[4]|21481007
and
1.5 million deaths|264623001|419620001|264623001|268923008
in children|410601007|160499008
under the age|424144002
of 5.|264706000|264605009

Oral rehydration solutions (ORS)|409585005
with modest amounts|107651007
of salts|387390002
and
zinc tablets|86739005|385055001|86739005|428673006
are
the treatment|276239002|416118004
of choice
and
have
been
estimated|414135002
to
have
saved
50 million children|410601007|160499008
in the past 25 years.|410513005|258707000

In cases|398241000|413769002
where ORS
is
not available, homemade solutions|103328004|8537005
are
often|70232002
used.|394850002

Diarrhea|398032003
is
defined
by the World Health Organization|263775005|21139007
as
having
three|421291004
or
more loose|242762006|78799005
or
liquid stools|398212009
per day,|258703001|259032004
or
as
having
more stools|242762006|39477002
than
is
normal|17621005|258744000
for
that person.[3]|125676002

Secretory diarrhea means|15699003|255586005
that there
is
an increase|260366006
in the active secretion,|55561003|46242002
or
there
is
an inhibition|61511001|419495008
of absorption.

There
is
little|281411007|255507004
to no structural damage.|37782003

The most common cause|4757001|72906007|134198009
of this type|261664005
of diarrhea|398032003
is
a cholera toxin|255821009
that
stimulates
the secretion|46242002
of anions,|47707009
especially chloride ions.

Therefore,
to
maintain|385630006
a charge balance|249982003|78933003|282295000
in the lumen,|113342003|342806003|398252006
sodium|39972003
is
carried|288345009
with it,
along
with water.|11713004|119318008

In this type|261664005
of diarrhea intestinal fluid secretion|398032003|261093006|32457005|46242002|398032003|261093006|33463005|46242002|398032003|261093006|255765007|46242002|398032003|261093006|46242002
is
isotonic
with plasma even|419185008
during fasting.|16985007

It
continues|255238004
even
when
there
is
no oral food intake.|260548002|48263008

Osmotic diarrhea|2946003
occurs|272120004
when
too
much water|11713004|119318008
is
drawn
into the bowels.|261093006

If
a person|125676002
drinks|226465004
solutions|8537005
with excessive sugar|260378005|2331003|260378005|74801000
or
excessive salt,|260378005|387390002
these
can
draw
water|11713004|119318008
from the body|279495008|123037004
into the bowel|261093006
and
cause|23981006|134198009
osmotic diarrhea.|2946003

Osmotic diarrhea|2946003
can
also
be
the result|394617004
of maldigestion|61578001
(
e.g.
,
pancreatic disease|3855007
or
Coeliac disease,|396331005
in which
the nutrients|226355009
are
left|7771000
in the lumen|113342003|342806003|398252006
to pull|303370007
in water.|11713004|119318008

Or
it
can
be
caused|23981006|134198009
by osmotic laxatives|373571004
(
which
work|261041009
to
alleviate
constipation|14760008
by drawing water|11713004|119318008
into the bowels|261093006
).

In healthy individuals,|263775005|125676002|263775005|385435006
too
much magnesium|72717003
or
vitamin C|46123006
or
undigested
lactose|423291009
can
produce
osmotic diarrhea|2946003
and
distention|25322007
of the bowel.|261093006

A person|125676002
who
has
lactose intolerance|267425008
can
have
difficulty absorbing lactose|371157007|423291009
after an extraordinarily high intake|75540009|371879000
of dairy products.|226760005

In persons|125676002
who
have
fructose malabsorption,|58202007|32230006
excess fructose intake|260378005|226342008
can
also
cause|23981006|134198009
diarrhea.|398032003

High-fructose foods|75540009|58202007|255620007|371879000|58202007|255620007
that also
have
a high glucose content|75540009|67079006|276824008|75540009|72191006|276824008|371879000|67079006|276824008|371879000|72191006|276824008
are
more absorbable|242762006
and
less likely to|276139006|2931005|263796003|2931005
cause|23981006|134198009
diarrhea.|398032003

Sugar alcohols|116267009
such as sorbitol|412513004
(often|70232002
found|404684003
in sugar-free foods|264322002|37837009
)
are
difficult|52925006
for the body|279495008|123037004
to absorb
and
,
in large amounts,|255509001|107651007
may
lead|88488004
to osmotic diarrhea.|2946003

In most
of these cases,|398241000|413769002
osmotic diarrhea stops|2946003|260890000
when
offending agent|260872001
(e.g.|258795003

milk,|3718001|119321005|70813002
sorbitol|412513004
)
is
stopped.|385654001

Exudative diarrhea|255305006|398032003
occurs|272120004
with the presence|386397008
of blood|87612001|119273009
and
pus|11311000|119323008
in the stool.|39477002

This
occurs|272120004
with inflammatory bowel diseases,|24526004
such as Crohn's disease|34000006
or
ulcerative colitis,|64766004
and
other severe infections|74964007|24484000
such as _[E.

coli]
(/wiki/Escherichia_coli|112283007
)
_
or
other forms|74964007|246176004
of food poisoning.[5]|75258004

Motility-related diarrhea|272151006|398032003|262094002|398032003|398598008|272151006|398032003|398598008|262094002|398032003
is
caused|23981006|134198009
by the rapid movement|255358001|255324009
of food|255620007
through the intestines|261093006
(hypermotility
).

If
the food|255620007
moves|302000008
too quickly
through the gastrointestinal tract,|122865005|279972009
there
is
not
enough time|410669006
for sufficient nutrients|51117008|226355009
and
water to|11713004|119318008
be
absorbed.

This
can
be
due to a vagotomy|65310005
or
diabetic neuropathy,|230572002
or
a complication|116223007|263718001
of menstruation_[citation|248957007
needed|410525008|103325001
_].

Hyperthyroidism|34486009
can
produce
hypermotility
and
lead|88488004
to pseudodiarrhea|34231006
and
occasionally real diarrhea.|398032003

Diarrhea|398032003
can
be
treated|28995006
with antimotility agents|260872001
(
such as loperamide.|387040009

Hypermotility
can
be
observed
in people|125676002
who
have
had
portions|260726005
of their bowel|261093006
removed|127485006
,
allowing
less total time|276139006|258755000|410669006|276139006|255619001|410669006|263796003|258755000|410669006|263796003|255619001|410669006
for absorption
of nutrients.|226355009

Inflammatory diarrhea|95544006
occurs|272120004
when
there
is
damage|37782003
to the mucosal lining|313268005|50009006
or
brush border,|17599007
which
leads|88488004|236874000
to a passive loss
of protein-rich fluids,|88878007|224166006|32457005|88878007|224166006|33463005
and
a decreased ability to|1250004|371150009|260400001|371150009|260371004|371150009
absorb
these lost fluids.|32457005|33463005

Features
of all three|421291004
of the other types|74964007|261664005
of diarrhea|398032003
can
be
found|404684003
in this type|261664005
of diarrhea.|398032003

It
can
be
caused|23981006|134198009
by bacterial infections,|301811001
viral infections,|34014006
parasitic infections,|17322007
or
autoimmune problems|263680009|55607006
such as inflammatory bowel diseases.|24526004

It
can
also
be
caused|23981006|134198009
by tuberculosis,|371569005
colon cancer,|363406005|269533000
and
enteritis._[citation|64613007

Generally,
if
there
is
blood|87612001|119273009
visible|24054004
in the stools,|39477002
it
is
not diarrhea,|398032003
but
dysentery.|111939009

The blood|87612001|119273009
is
trace|260405006
of an invasion|370052007
of bowel tissue.|261093006|85756007

Dysentery|111939009
is
a symptom
of,
among others,|74964007
_Shigella_,|36188001|77352002
_Entamoeba histolytica_,|4716008
and
_Salmonella_.|27268008|302231008

Diarrhea|398032003
is
most commonly|4757001
due to viral gastroenteritis|111843007
with rotavirus,|417542000
which
accounts
for 40%|259031006
of cases|398241000|413769002
in children|410601007|160499008
under five.|421820001

(p.|20304007

)
In travelers however bacterial infections predominate.|301811001|83296008

Various toxins|256220008|80917008
such as mushroom poisoning
and
drugs|410942007
can
also
cause|23981006|134198009
acute diarrhea.|409966000

Chronic diarrhea|236071009
can
be
the part|260726005
of the presentations|246105001
of a number|410680006|410681005
of chronic medical conditions|90734009|74188005|78326006|90734009|74188005|260905004
affecting|247591002|248448006
the intestine.|261093006

Common causes|72906007|134198009
include|55919000
ulcerative colitis,|64766004
Crohn's disease,|34000006
microscopic colitis,|235753003
celiac disease,|396331005
irritable bowel syndrome|10743008
and
bile acid malabsorption.|54724002|32230006|104552002|32230006

There
are
many causes|260396001|134198009
of infectious diarrhea,|111939009
which
include|55919000
viruses,|49872002
bacteria|409822003
and
parasites.|37763007

Norovirus|407359000
is
the most common cause|4757001|72906007|134198009
of viral diarrhea|111843007
in adults,|133936004
[9]
but
rotavirus|417542000
is
the most common cause|4757001|72906007|134198009
in children|410601007|160499008
under five years old.|421820001|258707000|70753007

Adenovirus types 40|424470006|261664005|259031006|25225006|261664005|259031006
and
41,
[11]
and
astroviruses
cause|23981006|134198009
a significant number|386134007|410680006|386134007|410681005
of infections.[12]

The bacterium Campylobacter|409822003|35408001
is
a common cause|72906007|134198009
of bacterial diarrhea,|409822003|398032003
but
infections
by Salmonellae,|27268008
Shigellae|36188001|77352002
and
some
strains|48532005|276768000
of _Escherichia coli_ (E . coli)|112283007
are
frequent.[13]|70232002

In the elderly,|105436006
particularly
those who
have
been
treated|28995006
with antibiotics|255631004
for unrelated infections,|262241003
a toxin|80917008
produced
by _Clostridium difficile_ often|5933001|70232002
causes|134198009
severe diarrhea.[14]|409587002

Parasites|37763007
do
not often|70232002
cause|23981006|134198009
diarrhea|398032003
except for the protozoan _Giardia_,|417396000|61419001|417396000|58265007
which
can
cause|23981006|134198009
chronic infections|177010002
if
these
are
not
diagnosed|439401001
and
treated|28995006
with drugs|410942007
such as metronidazole,|372602008
[15]
and
_Entamoeba histolytica_.[16][17]|4716008

Other infectious agents|74964007|36272005
such as parasites|37763007
and
bacterial toxins also|18836009
occur.|272120004

In sanitary living conditions|4683004
where there
is
ample food|255620007
and
a supply|425398004
of clean water,|11713004|119318008
an otherwise healthy person usually|263775005|125676002
recovers|74822006
from viral infections|34014006
in a few days.|57176003|258703001

However,
for ill|367391008
or
malnourished individuals,|248325000|125676002|248325000|385435006
diarrhea|398032003
can
lead|88488004
to severe dehydration|24484000|34095006
and
can
become
life-threatening.[18]|224130005

Malabsorption|32230006
is
the inability
to absorb food fully,|255620007
mostly
from disorders|64572001
in the small bowel,|264196002
but
also
due to maldigestion|61578001
from diseases|64572001
of the pancreas.|15776009|181277001

Causes|134198009
include|55919000
:

The two overlapping types here|420797005|24846002|261664005
are
of unknown origin|54690008
:

Another possible cause|371930009|134198009|60022001|134198009
of diarrhea|398032003
is
irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)|10743008
which usually
presents|52101004|246105001
with abdominal discomfort|43364001
relieved|398004007
by defecation|111989001
and
unusual stool|39477002
(diarrhea|398032003

Symptoms
of diarrhea-predominant IBS|398032003|10743008|398032003|254169002
can
be
managed|119270007
through a combination|89780004
of dietary changes,|41829006|243326001|41829006|263703002
soluble fiber supplements,|116272000|373453009|400293002|373453009|87028007|373453009|37202001|373453009
and/or
medications|410942007
such as loperamide|387040009
or
codeine.|387494007|105142004

About 30%
of patients|116154003
with diarrhea-predominant IBS|398032003|10743008|398032003|254169002
have
bile acid malabsorption|54724002|32230006|104552002|32230006
diagnosed|439401001
with an abnormal SeHCAT test.[20]|263654008|269814003|263654008|263654008|272393004

According to two researchers,|420797005
Nesse
and
Williams,
diarrhea|398032003
may
function|246464006
as an evolved expulsion defense mechanism.|59381007|118636005|224992003

As a result,|394617004
if
it
is
stopped,|385654001
there
might
be
a delay
in recovery.

They
cite
in support|9096001|243114000
of this argument research|9182005
published
in 1973
which
found|404684003
that treating _Shigella_|28995006|36188001|28995006|77352002
with the anti-diarrhea drug|398032003|410942007
(Co-phenotrope,
Lomotil caused people to|23981006|125676002|134198009|125676002
stay
feverish twice|386661006|421832002
as long|255511005
as those
not so
treated.|28995006

The researchers indeed
themselves
observed
that
:
"Lomotil
may
be
contraindicated|410536001
in shigellosis.|36188001

Diarrhea|398032003
may
represent
a defense mechanism".[23]|224992003|264657009

The following types|255260001|261664005
of diarrhea|398032003
may
indicate|410535002
further investigation|46053002|386053000
is
needed|410525008|103325001
:

A severity score|278305009
is
used to|394850002
aid|246088000
diagnosis|439401001
in children.[24]|410601007|160499008

A rotavirus vaccine|398866008

the rates
of diarrhea|398032003
in a population.|385436007|389109008

New vaccines|7147002|398827000
against rotavirus,|417542000

under development,|278923009
as well as
other causes|74964007|134198009
of infectious diarrhea.|111939009

Probiotics

the risk|30207005
of diarrhea|398032003
in those taking antibiotics.|419652001|255631004

In institutions|385437003
and
in communities,|133928008
interventions|225334002
that
promote
hand washing|258154008
lead|88488004
to significant reductions|386134007|58294000|386134007|289928003
in the incidence
of diarrhea.[26]|398032003

In many cases|398241000|413769002
of diarrhea,|398032003
replacing|370124000
lost fluid|32457005|33463005|255765007
and
salts|387390002
is
the only treatment|50607009|276239002|50607009|416118004|420295001|276239002|420295001|416118004
needed.|410525008|103325001

This
is
usually
by mouth ? oral rehydration therapy ?|243222002
or
,
in severe cases,|24484000|398241000|24484000|413769002
intravenously.

Diet restrictions
such as the BRAT diet|41829006
are
no longer|255511005
recommended.

Research
does
not
support|9096001|243114000
the limiting|255469002
of milk|3718001|119321005|70813002
to children|410601007|160499008
as
doing
so|223528007
has
no effect|253861007
on duration|103335007
of diarrhea.|398032003

To the contrary,
WHO
recommends
that children|410601007|160499008
with diarrhea|398032003
continue|255238004
to
eat|48263008
as sufficient nutrients|51117008|226355009
are
usually still
absorbed to
support|9096001|243114000
continued growth|255238004
and
weight gain|262286000
and
that continuing|255238004
to eat|48263008
speeds
also recovery
of normal intestinal functioning.|17621005|261093006|246464006|258744000|261093006|246464006

CDC
recommends
that children|410601007|160499008
and
adults|133936004
with cholera also|63650001
continue|255238004
to
eat.[29]|48263008

Medications|410942007
such as loperamide|387040009
(Imodium|57574005
)
and
bismuth subsalicylate|409307004
may
be
beneficial
;
however
they
may
be
contraindicated|410536001
in certain situations.[30]|17162000

Oral Rehydration Solution (ORS)|409585005
can
be
used|394850002
to
prevent
dehydration|34095006
and
in many cases|398241000|413769002
is
quite literally
a life saver.|224130005

Standard home solutions|261770009|8537005

and
unsweetened fresh fruit juices|227416001|129559002|261013005|129560007
can
have
from half
a teaspoon|415703001
to full teaspoon|261015003|415703001
of salt|387390002
(
from one-|421379005
and
-
a-half
to three grams|421291004|258682000
)
added

Clean plain water|11713004|119318008
can
also
be
one|421379005
of several fluids|261028005|32457005|261028005|33463005
given.|419582001

There
are

such as Pedialyte,
and
relief agencies|224978009|224877003
such as UNICEF widely
distribute
packets|419888008
of salts|387390002
and
sugar.|2331003|74801000

A
WHO publication
for physicians|309343006
recommends
a homemade ORS
consisting
of one liter water|421379005|258770004|11713004|421379005|258770004|119318008
with one teaspoon salt|421379005|415703001|387390002
(3 grams|260313008|258682000
)
and
two tablespoons sugar|420797005|415702006|2331003|420797005|415702006|74801000
(18 grams|258682000
)
added
[6]
(approximately|26175008
the "taste|76489005
of tears"[31]|40431001|264664006|122594008|264664006
).

Rehydration Project recommends|243221009
adding
the same amount|262126009|107651007
of sugar|2331003|74801000
but
only one-half|50607009|421379005|420295001|421379005
a teaspoon|415703001
of salt,|387390002
stating|398070004
that
this more|242762006
dilute|421399004
approach
is
less risky|276139006|30207005|263796003|30207005
with very little loss|260358002|281411007|260358002|255507004
of effectiveness.|255403003

Both
agree
that drinks|226465004
with too
much sugar|2331003|74801000
or
salt|387390002
can
make
dehydration worse.[6][32]|34095006|230993007|34095006|390772001|34095006|231877006

Appropriate amounts|107651007
of supplemental zinc|387021003
and
potassium|88480006
should
be
added
if available.|103328004

But
the availability|103328004
of these
should
not
delay
rehydration.|243221009

As WHO
points
out,|255529000
the most important thing|4757001
is
to
begin|255395001
preventing dehydration|34095006|116699007|34095006
as early|264499004
as possible.|371930009|60022001

In another example
of prompt ORS hopefully
preventing|116699007
dehydration,|34095006
CDC
recommends
for the treatment|276239002|416118004
of cholera continuing to|63650001|255238004
give|419582001
Oral Rehydration Solution|409585005
during travel|420008001
to medical treatment.[29]|74188005|276239002|74188005|416118004

Vomiting|249497008
often|70232002
occurs|272120004
during the first hour|255216001|258702006|255216001|286551008|232714002|258702006|232714002|286551008
or
two|420797005
of treatment|276239002|416118004
with ORS,
especially
if
a child|410601007|160499008
drinks|226465004
the solution too quickly,|8537005|77899000
but
this seldom|103356009
prevents|116699007
successful rehydration|385669000|243221009
since
most
of the fluid|32457005|33463005|255765007
is
still
absorbed.

WHO
recommends
that
if
a child vomits,|410601007|249497008|160499008|249497008
to
wait
five|421820001

ten minutes|23067006|258701004|23067006|255507004|23067006|356624006|420258001|258701004|420258001|255507004|420258001|356624006
and
then
start|255395001
to
give|419582001
the solution again more slowly.[6]|8537005|419443000|77899000|419443000

Drinks|226465004
especially high|75540009|371879000
in simple sugars,|116257004
such as soft drinks|37378003|226465004
and
fruit juices,|129560007
are
not
recommended
in children|410601007|160499008
under 5 years|264706000|258707000|264605009|258707000
of age|424144002
as
they
may
_increase_ dehydration.|260366006|34095006

A too rich solution|224166006|8537005|224166006|77899000
in the gut draws water|122865005|11713004|122865005|119318008
from the rest|258157001
of the body,|279495008|123037004
just
as if
the person|125676002
were
to
drink|226465004
sea water.

Plain water|11713004|119318008
may
be
used|394850002
if
more specific|242762006|69658003
and
effective ORT preparations|255403003|225106003|254648000|225106003
are
unavailable|397854000
or
are
not palatable.

Additionally,
a mix|26242008|421826007
of
both
plain water|11713004|119318008
and
drinks|226465004
perhaps too rich|224166006
in sugar|2331003|74801000
and
salt|387390002
can
alternatively
be
given|419582001
to the same person,|262126009|125676002
which
the goal|410518001
of providing
a medium amount|255508009|107651007
of sodium overall.|39972003

A nasogastric tube|17102003
can
be
used|394850002
in young children|84422007|410601007|84422007|160499008
to administer fluids|418283001|32457005|418283001|33463005
if
warranted.[34]

WHO
recommends
a child|410601007|160499008
with diarrhea|398032003
continue|255238004
to
be
fed.|238092004

Continued feeding|255238004|129007004
speeds
the recovery
of normal intestinal function.|17621005|261093006|246464006|258744000|261093006|246464006

In contrast,
children|410601007|160499008
whose food|255620007
is
restricted,|263856008
have
diarrhea|398032003
of longer duration|260384008
and
recover|74822006
intestinal function more slowly.|261093006|246464006|419443000

A child|410601007|160499008
should
also
continue|255238004
to
be
breastfed.|169741004

A 2005
WHO manual|87982008
for physicians|309343006
and
other senior health workers|74964007|263775005|106541005
is
quite emphatic regarding
this point
:
"Food|255620007
should
_never_
be
withheld
and
the child's usual foods|410601007|255620007|160499008|255620007
should
_
not_
be
diluted.|421399004

Breastfeeding|169741004
should
_always_
be
continued."[6]|255238004
And
in the specific example|69658003
of cholera,|63650001
CDC also
makes
the same recommendation.[29]|262126009

While
antibiotics|255631004
are
beneficial
in certain types|17162000|261664005
of acute diarrhea,|409966000
they
are
usually
not
used|394850002
except
in specific situations.|69658003

There
are
concerns
that antibiotics|255631004
may
increase|260366006
the risk|30207005
of hemolytic uremic syndrome|111407006
in people|125676002
infected
with Escherichia coli O157|407166006

H7.

In resource poor countries,|11403006|223369002|255351007|223369002
treatment|276239002|416118004
with antibiotics|255631004
may
be
beneficial.

However,
some bacteria|409822003
are
developing
antibiotic resistance,|255631004|30714006
particularly _Shigella_.[38]|36188001|264670000|77352002|264670000

Antibiotics|255631004
can
also
cause|23981006|134198009
diarrhea,|398032003
and
antibiotic-associated diarrhea|301469002
is
the most common adverse effect|4757001|72906007|281647001|4757001|72906007
of treatment|276239002|416118004
with general antibiotics.|60132005|255631004

While
bismuth compounds|52720007
(Pepto-Bismol
decreased|1250004|260400001|260371004
the number|410680006|410681005
of bowel movements|111989001
in those with travelers' diarrhea,|20401003|11840006|421463005|11840006
they
do
not
decrease|260400001|260370003
the length|410668003
of illness.|39104002

These agents|260872001
should
only
be
used|394850002
if bloody diarrhea|95545007
is
not
present.[40]|52101004|259031006|246105001|259031006

Anti motility agents|255635008|255635008|398598008
like loperamide|387040009
are
effective|255403003|254648000
at reducing|260400001
the duration|103335007
of diarrhea.[36]|398032003

Codeine|387494007|105142004
is
used|394850002
in the treatment|276239002|416118004
of diarrhea|398032003
to slow down peristalsis|419443000|247524003|28423000

into the body,|279495008|123037004
which
gives|419582001
a firmer stool,|20583004|39477002

Bile acid sequestrants|372872006
such as cholestyramine,|387408001
colestipol|372811005
and
colesevelam|442510005
can
be
effective|255403003|254648000
in chronic diarrhea|236071009
due to bile acid malabsorption.|54724002|32230006|104552002|32230006

Therapeutic trials|262202000|110465008
of these drugs|410942007
are
indicated|410535002
in chronic diarrhea|236071009
if
bile acid malabsorption|54724002|32230006|104552002|32230006
cannot
be
diagnosed|439401001
with a specific test,|69658003|269814003|69658003|69658003|272393004

Zinc supplementation|86739005
benefits
children|410601007|160499008
suffering
from diarrhea|398032003
in developing countries,|223369002
but
only
in infants|418119000
over six months old.|422218008|258706009|70753007

This
supports|9096001|243114000
the World Health Organisation guidelines|263775005|21139007
for zinc,|86739005
but
not
in the very young.[42]|260358002|84422007

Probiotics
reduce|260400001
the duration|103335007
of symptoms
by one day|421379005|258703001|421379005|259032004
and
reduced|260400001
the chances
of symptoms
lasting
longer|255511005
than four days|421534005|258703001
by 60%.

The probiotic lactobacillus|43690008
can
help
prevent
antibiotic associated diarrhea|301469002
in adults|133936004
but
possibly|60022001
not children.|410601007|160499008

For those
who
with lactose intolerance,|267425008
taking|419652001
digestive enzymes|21891005
containing|42504009
lactase|424369009
when
consuming dairy products|226760005
is
recommended.

World wide|90522003

of diarrhea|398032003
occurred|272120004
which
results|394617004
in 1.5 million deaths|264623001|419620001|264623001|268923008
among children|410601007|160499008
