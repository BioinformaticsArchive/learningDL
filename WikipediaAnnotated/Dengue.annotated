(UK /?d???e?/
or
US /?d???i?/,
also
known|36692007
as
*
*breakbone fever|38362002
*
*,
is
an infectious tropical disease|191415002
caused|23981006|134198009
by the dengue virus.|34348001

Symptoms
include|55919000
fever,|386661006
headache,|25064002
muscle|91727004
and
joint pains,|57676002
and
a characteristic skin rash|271807003
that
is
similar
to measles.|14189004

In a small proportion|255507004|8212001
of cases|398241000|413769002
the disease|64572001
develops
into the life-threatening|224130005
*
*dengue hemorrhagic fever|20927009
*
*,
resulting|42752001
in bleeding,|131148009
low levels|62482003|258395000|371880002|258395000
of blood platelets|16378004
and
blood plasma leakage,|419185008|76676007
or
into
*
*dengue shock syndrome|409671005
*
*,
where dangerously low blood pressure|45007003
occurs.|272120004

Dengue|38362002
is
transmitted|60117003|258150004
by several species|261028005|69658003
of mosquito|359768004
within the genus _Aedes_,|18511007|57637003
principally _[A.

aegypti]
(/wiki/Aedes_aegypti|55488006
)
_.

The virus|49872002
has
four different types|421534005|263735002|261664005
;
infection
with one type usually|421379005|261664005
gives|419582001
lifelong immunity|58915005
to
that type,|261664005
but
only short-term immunity|50607009|58915005|420295001|58915005
to the others.|74964007

Subsequent infection|255260001
with a different type|263735002|261664005
increases|260366006
the risk|30207005
of severe complications.|24484000|116223007

As
there
is
no commercially available vaccine,|103328004|398827000
prevention|169443000
is
sought
by reducing|260400001
the habitat
and
the number|410680006|410681005
of mosquitoes|359768004
and
limiting exposure|255469002|71677004|255469002|24932003
to bites.|3404009

Treatment|276239002|416118004
of acute dengue|272118002|38362002
is
supportive,
using|260676000
either
oral|260548002
or
intravenous rehydration|243221009|255560000|243221009
for mild|255604002
or
moderate disease,|6736007|64572001
and
intravenous fluids|118431008
and
blood transfusion
for more severe cases.|242762006|24484000|398241000|242762006|24484000|413769002

The incidence
of dengue fever|38362002
has
increased|35105006|260366006
dramatically
since
the 1960s,
with
around 50?100 million people|125676002
infected
yearly.|53281000

Early descriptions|264499004
of the condition date|260905004|410671006
from 1779,
and
its viral cause|134198009
and
the transmission|258150004
were
elucidated
in the early 20th century.|264499004

Dengue|38362002
has
become
a global problem|60132005|55607006
since
the Second World War|81170007|257997001|288495006
and
is
endemic
in more|242762006
than 110 countries.|223369002

Apart from eliminating
the mosquitoes,|359768004
work|261041009
is
ongoing|255238004
on a vaccine,|398827000
as well as
medication|410942007
targeted
directly
at the virus.|49872002

Typically,
people|125676002
infected
with dengue virus|34348001
are
asymptomatic|84387000
(80%
)
or
only
have
mild symptoms|162468002
such as an uncomplicated fever.|263914008|386661006

Others|74964007
have
more severe illness|242762006|24484000|39104002
(5%|264706000|264605009
)
,
and
in a small proportion|255507004|8212001
it
is
life-threatening.|224130005

The incubation period|406646006
(time|410669006
between exposure|71677004|24932003
and
onset|77374008
of symptoms
)
ranges
from 3?14 days,|260313008|258703001
but
most often|4757001|70232002
it
is
4?7 days.|260308009|258703001

Therefore,
travelers
returning|7528007
from endemic areas|42798000
are
unlikely to
have
dengue|38362002
if
fever|386661006
or
other symptoms|74964007
start|255395001
more
than 14 days|258703001
after
arriving
home.|261770009

Children often|410601007|70232002|160499008|70232002
experience
symptoms
similar
to those
of the common cold|82272006|54150009
and
gastroenteritis|25374005
(vomiting|249497008
and
diarrhea|398032003
)
[6]
and
have
a greater risk|263768009|30207005
of severe complications,|24484000|116223007
[5][7]|264706000|264605009
though
initial symptoms|884001|232714002
are
generally mild|255604002
but
include|55919000
high fever.[7]|75540009|386661006|371879000|386661006

The characteristic symptoms
of dengue|38362002
are
sudden-onset fever,|385315009|386661006|255363002|386661006
headache|25064002
(typically
located
behind the eyes|81745001
)
,
muscle|91727004
and
joint pains,|57676002
and
a rash.|271807003

The alternative name
for dengue,|38362002
"breakbone fever",|38362002
comes
from the associated muscle|47429007|91727004
and
joint pains.|57676002

The course|288524001
of infection
is
divided|422033008
into three phases|421291004|272108007
:
febrile, critical,|386661006
and
recovery.[8]

The febrile phase|386661006|21191007
involves|248448006
high fever,|75540009|386661006|371879000|386661006
often over 40 ?C|70232002|21481007|259031006
(104 ?F|372639009
)
,
and
is
associated|47429007
with generalized pain|82991003
and
a headache|25064002
;
this usually
lasts
two to seven days.|420797005|420359007|258703001

Vomiting|249497008
may
also
occur.|272120004

A rash|271807003
occurs|272120004
in 50?80%
of those with symptoms[9][10]|20401003|421463005
in the first|255216001|232714002
or
second day|81170007|258703001|81170007|259032004|257997001|258703001|257997001|259032004|288495006|258703001|288495006|259032004
of symptoms
as flushed skin,|271811009
or
later|260383002
in the course|288524001
of illness|39104002
(days 4?7|258703001
)
,
as
a measles-like rash.|247470007

Some petechiae|423716004
(small red|255507004|386713009|255507004|371240000
spots|271807003|285305004
that
do
not
disappear
when
the skin|119325001|39937001|181469002
is
pressed,
which
are
caused|23981006|134198009
by broken capillaries|20982000
can
appear
at this point,
[8]
as
may
some mild bleeding|255604002|131148009
from the mucous membranes|313268005
of the mouth|74262004|123851003|21082005|181220002
and
nose.|260540009|181195007

The fever|386661006
itself
is
classically biphasic|1217004
in nature,|277302009
breaking
and
then
returning|7528007
for one|421379005
or
two days,|420797005|258703001
although
there
is
wide variation|90522003|40885006
in
how
often|70232002
this pattern actually happens.[11][12]|272135003

In some people,|125676002
the disease|64572001
proceeds
to a critical phase|21191007
around the time fever resolves[7]|410669006|386661006
and
typically
lasts
one|421379005
to two days.|420797005|258703001

During this phase there|21191007
may
be
significant fluid accumulation|386134007|17672001
in the chest|261179002
and
abdominal cavity|52731004|361294009
due to increased capillary permeability|1608005
and
leakage.|76676007

This
leads|88488004|236874000
to depletion|69251000
of fluid|32457005|33463005|255765007
from the circulation|413854007
and
decreased blood supply|1250004|87612001|425398004|1250004|119273009|425398004|260400001|87612001|425398004|260400001|119273009|425398004|260371004|87612001|425398004|260371004|119273009|425398004
to vital organs.|260410005|410653004

During this phase,|21191007
organ dysfunction|410653004|386585008
and
severe bleeding,|24484000|131148009
typically
from the gastrointestinal tract,|122865005|279972009
may
occur.|272120004

Shock|27942005
(dengue shock syndrome|409671005
)
and
hemorrhage|131148009
(dengue hemorrhagic fever|20927009
)
occur|272120004
in less|276139006|263796003
than 5%|264706000|264605009
of all cases|398241000|413769002
of dengue,|38362002
[5] however|264706000|264605009
those who
have
previously
been
infected
with other serotypes|74964007|276770009
of dengue virus|34348001
("secondary infection"|264569006
)
are
at an increased risk.[5][13]|35105006|30207005|260366006|30207005

The recovery phase|21191007
occurs|272120004
next,|18769003|255260001
with resorption
of the leaked fluid|87952002|32457005|87952002|33463005|87952002|255765007|87952002
into the bloodstream.

This usually
lasts
two|420797005
to three days.|421291004|258703001

The improvement
is
often|70232002
striking|89098005
,
but
there
may
be
severe itching|24484000|424492005
and
a slow heart rate.|48867003

Another rash|271807003
may
occur|272120004
with
either
a maculopapular|263804000
or
a vasculitic appearance,|31996006|386548000|31996006|255412001
which
is
followed|367409002
by peeling|257890000|51979000
of the skin.|119325001|39937001|181469002

During this stage,|21191007|371508000|261612004
a fluid|32457005|33463005|255765007
overload
state|398070004
may
occur|272120004
;
if
it
affects|4065008
the brain,|12738006|258335003
it
may
cause|23981006|134198009
a reduced level|260400001|258395000|260400001|276625007
of consciousness|106167005
or
seizures.|91175000

A feeling|285854004
of fatigue|84229001
may
last
for weeks|258705008
in adults.[7]|133936004

Dengue|38362002
can
occasionally
affect|4065008
several other body systems,|261028005|91689009
[8]
either
in isolation|40174006|46651001
or
along
with the classic dengue symptoms.|38362002

A decreased level|1250004|258395000|1250004|276625007|260400001|258395000|260400001|276625007|260371004|258395000|260371004|276625007
of consciousness|106167005
occurs|272120004
in 0.5?6%|260316000
of severe cases,|24484000|398241000|24484000|413769002
which
is
attributable
either
to infection
of the brain|12738006|258335003
by the virus|49872002
or
indirectly
as a result|394617004
of impairment|40226000
of vital organs,|260410005|410653004
for example,
the liver.[6][12]|10200004|181268008

Other neurological disorders|74964007|118940003
have
been
reported|229059009|223458004
in the context|263491009
of dengue,|38362002
such as transverse myelitis|16631009
and
Guillain-Barr? syndrome.

Infection
of the heart|80891009|302509004
and
acute liver failure|235884008
are
among the rarer complications.[5][8]|84638005|116223007|103356009|116223007

Dengue fever virus|34348001
(DENV
)
is
an RNA virus|11705000
of the family _Flaviviridae_|243602009
;
genus _Flavivirus_.|28375005

Other members|74964007|394852005
of the same genus|262126009|18511007
include|55919000
yellow fever virus,|26630006
West Nile virus,|57311007
[St.

Louis encephalitis virus]|45170000|49872002|45170000
(/wiki/St._Louis_encephalitis|417607009
)
,
Japanese encephalitis virus,|243603004
tick-borne encephalitis virus,|32323003
Kyasanur forest disease virus,|32137001
and
Omsk hemorrhagic fever virus.|51439004

Most
are
transmitted|60117003|258150004
by arthropods|106762008
(mosquitoes|359768004
or
ticks,|106831000
and
are
therefore also
referred|439980006
to
as
arboviruses|281165003
(_ar_thropod-_bo_rne viruses|49872002
).[12]

The dengue virus genome|34348001|18470003
(genetic material|256926007
)
contains|42504009
about 11,000 nucleotide bases,|71211001|71211001|418836005
which
code
for the three different types|421291004|263735002|261664005
of protein molecules|88878007|290005005
(C,
prM
and
E
)
that
form|246176004
the virus particle|285296008
and
seven other types|420359007|261664005
of protein molecules|88878007|290005005
(NS1,|205824006
NS2a,
NS2b,
NS3,
NS4a,
NS4b,
NS5
)
that
are
only
found|404684003
in infected host cells|4421005
and
are
required
for replication|74256009
of the virus.|49872002

There
are
four strains|421534005|48532005|421534005|276768000
of the virus,|49872002
which
are
called
serotypes,|276770009
and
these
are
referred|439980006
to
as
DENV-1,
DENV-2,
DENV-3
and
DENV-4.[2]

Dengue virus|34348001
is
primarily
transmitted|60117003|258150004
by _Aedes_ mosquitoes,|57637003|359768004
particularly _[A.

aegypti]
(/wiki/Aedes_aegypti|55488006
)
_.

These mosquitoes usually|359768004
live|419749002
between the latitudes
of 35?
North
and
35?
South
below an elevation|103720008|255456001
of 1,000 metres|260305007|272185007
(3,300 ft|260313008
).

They typically
bite|3404009|25272006
during the day,|258703001|259032004
particularly
in the early morning|264499004|73775008
and
in the evening.|3157002

Other _Aedes_ species|74964007|57637003|69658003
that
transmit|60117003
the disease|64572001
include|55919000
_[A.

albopictus]
(/wiki/Asian_tiger_mosquito|414978006|55488006

)
_
and
_[A.

scutellaris]
(/wiki/Aedes_scutellaris|22029000

_.

Humans|278412004
are
the primary host|63161005|261424001
of the virus,|49872002
[2][12]|260306008
but
it also
circulates|65929005
in nonhuman primates.|388073004

An infection
can
be

A female mosquito|248152002|359768004|224526002|359768004

takes|419652001
a blood meal|87612001|119273009
from a person|125676002
infected
with dengue fever|38362002
becomes
itself
infected
with the virus|49872002
in the cells|4421005
lining|50009006
its gut.|122865005

About 8?10 days later,|258703001
the virus|49872002
spreads|410677005
to other tissues|74964007|85756007
including|55919000
the mosquito's salivary glands|359768004|75535001
and
is
subsequently
released|68776005|129299003
into its saliva.|256897009

The virus|49872002
seems
to
have
no detrimental effect|253861007
on the mosquito,|359768004
which
remains
infected
for life.|224130005

_Aedes aegypti_ prefers to|55488006|225773000
lay|40199007|255576009
its eggs|102263004
in artificial water containers,|71967004|11713004|71967004|119318008
to
live|419749002
in close proximity|29179001
to humans,|278412004
and
to
feed|129007004
off people|125676002
rather than
other vertebrates.[19]|74964007|387967000

Dengue|38362002
can
also
be
transmitted|60117003|258150004
via infected blood products|410652009
and
through organ donation.

In countries|223369002
such as Singapore,|223593008
where dengue|38362002
is
endemic,
the risk|30207005
is
estimated to|414135002
be
between 1.6|260305007
and
6
per 10,000 transfusions.|303955003|5447007

Vertical transmission|33096000|258150004
(
from mother|72705000
to child|410601007|160499008
)
during pregnancy|289908002
or
at birth|3950001
has
been
reported.|229059009|223458004

Other person-to-person modes|74964007|125676002
of transmission|258150004
have
also
been
reported|229059009|223458004
,
but
are
very unusual.|260358002

The genetic variation|64195000
in dengue viruses|34348001
is
region specific, suggestive|410673009|69658003|7196007
that establishment
into new territories|7147002|398070004
is
relatively infrequent,|84638005
despite
dengue emerging|38362002
in new regions|7147002|410673009
in recent decades.[7]|6493001

Severe disease|24484000|64572001
is
more common|242762006|72906007
in babies|418119000
and
young children,|84422007|410601007|84422007|160499008
and
in contrast
to many other infections|74964007
it
is
more common|242762006|72906007
in children|410601007|160499008
that
are
relatively well nourished.|248324001

Other risk factors|74964007|80943009
for severe disease|24484000|64572001
include|55919000
female sex,|248152002
high body mass index,|75540009|60621009|371879000|60621009
[7]
and
viral load.|395058002

While
each serotype|276770009
can
cause|23981006|134198009
the full spectrum|414298005
of disease,|64572001
[13] virus strain|49872002|48532005|49872002|276768000|48532005|276768000
is
a risk factor.|80943009

Infection
with one serotype|421379005|276770009
is
thought to|88952004
produce
lifelong immunity|58915005
to
that type,|261664005
but
only short term protection|50607009|420295001
against the other three.|74964007|421291004

The risk|30207005
of severe disease|24484000|64572001
from secondary infection|264569006
increases|260366006
if
someone previously
exposed|24932003
to serotype DENV-1|276770009
contracts|78558002
serotype DENV-2|276770009
or
DENV-3,
or
if
someone previously
exposed|24932003
to DENV-3
acquires|255396000
DENV-2.

Dengue|38362002
can
be
life-threatening|224130005
in people|125676002
with chronic diseases|27624003
such as diabetes|73211009
and
asthma.[14]|195967001

Polymorphisms|50334000
(normal variations|17621005|40885006|258744000|40885006
)
in particular genes|67271001
have
been
linked
with an increased risk|35105006|30207005|260366006|30207005
of severe dengue complications.|24484000|38362002|116223007

Examples
include|55919000
the genes|67271001
coding
for the proteins|88878007
known|36692007
as TNF?,
mannan-binding lectin,|257768005|10669005
[1] CTLA4,|260305007

of human leukocyte antigen|47038001
from gene variations|67271001|40885006
of HLA-B.|54481006

A common genetic abnormality|72906007|3950001|276654001|72906007|255395001|276654001
in Africans,|413464008
known|36692007
as glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency,|124134002
appears
to
increase|260366006
the risk.|30207005

Polymorphisms|50334000
in the genes|67271001
for the vitamin D receptor|71516007|116647005|30178006|116647005
and
Fc?R|24028007
seem
to
offer|410527000
protection
against severe disease|24484000|64572001
in secondary dengue infection.[14]|264569006|38362002

When
a mosquito carrying dengue virus bites|242635009|288345009|34348001
a person,|125676002
the virus|49872002
enters|417985001
the skin|119325001|39937001|181469002
together with the mosquito's saliva.|359768004|256897009

It
binds|257768005
to
and
enters|417985001
white blood cells,|767002|52501007
and
reproduces
inside the cells|4421005
while
they
move|302000008|384598002|370125004
throughout the body.|279495008|123037004

The white blood cells|767002|52501007
respond
by producing
a number|410680006|410681005
of signaling proteins,|38952000|88878007
such as interferon,|49327004
which
are
responsible|394851003
for many|260396001
of the symptoms,
such as the fever,|386661006
the flu-like symptoms|315642008
and
the severe pains.|76948002

In severe infection,|24484000
the virus production|49872002
inside the body|279495008|123037004
is
greatly
increased|35105006|260366006
,
and
many more organs|242762006|410653004
(
such as the liver|10200004|181268008
and
the bone marrow|279729006
can
be
affected|247591002|248448006
,
and
fluid|32457005|33463005|255765007
from the bloodstream leaks|87952002
through the wall|224727009
of small blood vessels|27915009
into body cavities.|91806002

As a result,|394617004
less blood|276139006|87612001|276139006|119273009|263796003|87612001|263796003|119273009
circulates|65929005
in the blood vessels,|59820001
and
the blood pressure|75367002|392570002|386536003
becomes
so low|223528007|62482003|223528007|371880002
that
it
cannot
supply|425398004
sufficient blood|51117008|87612001|51117008|119273009
to vital organs.|260410005|410653004

Furthermore,
dysfunction|386585008
of the bone marrow|279729006
leads|88488004|236874000
to reduced numbers|260400001|410680006|260400001|410681005
of platelets,|16378004
which
are
necessary
for effective blood clotting|255403003|255403003|75753009|254648000|254648000|75753009
;
this
increases|260366006
the risk|30207005
of bleeding,|131148009
the other major complication|116223007|255603008
of dengue fever.[24]|38362002

Once
inside the skin,|119325001|39937001|181469002
dengue virus|34348001
binds|257768005
to Langerhans cells|76322003
(
a population|385436007|389109008
of dendritic cells
in the skin|119325001|39937001|181469002
that
identifies|7882003
pathogens|264418008
).

The virus|49872002
enters|417985001
the cells|4421005
through binding|257768005
between viral proteins|88878007
and
membrane proteins|83097008|88878007
on the Langerhans cell,|76322003
specifically
the C-type lectins|261664005|10669005
called
DC-SIGN,|72670004
mannose receptor|63089006|116647005
and
CLEC5A.

DC-SIGN,|72670004
a non-specific receptor|10003008|116647005
for foreign material|125670008
on dendritic cells,
seems
to
be
the main point|63161005
of entry.

The dendritic cell
moves|302000008
to the nearest lymph node.|40415009|59441001|40415009|181756000

Meanwhile,
the virus genome|49872002|18470003|18470003
is
translated
in membrane-bound vesicles|83097008|75958009|82515000|83097008|257768005|82515000|83097008|418131003|82515000
on the cell's endoplasmic reticulum,|4421005|33761008|362837007|33761008
where
the cell's protein synthesis apparatus|4421005|88878007|11798007|362837007|88878007|11798007
produces
new viral proteins|7147002|88878007
that
replicate|1305003|27582007
the viral RNA|27888000
and
begin|255395001
to
form|246176004
viral particles.|285296008

Immature virus particles|1090009|285296008
are
transported|57188001|360300001
to the Golgi apparatus,|65251009
the part|260726005
of the cell|4421005|362837007
where some
of the proteins|88878007
receive
necessary sugar chains|2331003|46666003|74801000|46666003
(glycoproteins.|59804006

The now mature new viruses|34071009|7147002|49872002
bud
on the surface|410678000
of the infected cell|4421005|362837007
and
are
released|68776005|129299003
by exocytosis.

They
are
then able to|371150009
enter|417985001
other white blood cells,|74964007|767002|74964007|52501007
such as monocytes|55918008|67776007
and
macrophages.[13]|58986001

The initial reaction|884001|263851003|232714002|263851003
of infected cells|4421005
is
to
produce
interferon,|49327004
a cytokine|75777003
that
raises|260399008
a number|410680006|410681005
of defenses
against viral infection|34014006
through the innate immune system|116003000
by augmenting|35105006
the production
of a large group|255509001|261586004|255509001|160481000|255509001|389109008
of proteins|88878007
mediated|73510009
by the JAK-STAT pathway.|49499008

Some serotypes|276770009
of dengue virus|34348001
appear
to
have
mechanisms|257544000
to slow down|419443000|247524003
this process.|415178003

Interferon also|49327004
activates
the adaptive immune system,|116003000
which
leads|88488004|236874000
to the generation
of antibodies|68498002
against the virus|49872002
as well as
T cells|57184004
that directly
attack|217315002|216299002
any cell|4421005|362837007
infected
with the virus.|49872002

Various antibodies|256220008|68498002
are
generated
;
some
bind|257768005
closely
to the viral proteins|88878007
and
target
them
for phagocytosis|56639005
(ingestion|111984006
by specialized cells|67995009|4421005|4421005
and
destruction|64597002
)
,
but
some
bind|257768005
the virus less well|49872002|20572008|20572008
and
appear
instead to
deliver
the virus|49872002
into a part|260726005
of the phagocytes|73568005
where it
is
not
destroyed
but
is
able to|371150009
replicate|1305003|27582007
further.[13]|46053002

It
is
not entirely
clear|263707001
why secondary infection|264569006
with a different strain|263735002|48532005|263735002|276768000
of dengue virus|34348001
places|257557008
people|125676002
at risk|410519009
of dengue hemorrhagic fever|20927009
and
dengue shock syndrome.|409671005

The most widely accepted hypothesis|4757001|385645004
is
that
of antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE).|68498002|371154000|418393006|112133008|371154000|418393006

The exact mechanism|257544000
behind ADE
is
unclear.

It
may
be
caused|23981006|134198009
by poor binding|11403006|257768005|255351007|257768005
of non-neutralizing antibodies|260212000
and
delivery|236973005|118215003
into the wrong compartment
of white blood cells|767002|52501007
that
have
ingested|111984006
the virus|49872002
for destruction.|64597002

There
is
a suspicion|22927000
that ADE
is
not
the only mechanism|50607009|257544000|420295001|257544000
underlying|255546002
severe dengue-related complications,|24484000|38362002|272151006|116223007|24484000|38362002|262094002|116223007
[1]|260305007
and
various lines|256220008|50009006
of research
have
implied
a role
for T cells|57184004
and
soluble factors
such as cytokines|75777003
and
the complement system.[24]|20823009|246333005

Severe disease|24484000|64572001
is
marked|46998006
by the problems|55607006
of capillary permeability|19381008
(
an allowance
of fluid|32457005|33463005|255765007
and
protein normally|88878007
contained|42504009
within blood to|87612001|119273009
pass
)
and
disordered blood clotting|34093004
that typically
prevents|116699007
bleeding.|131148009

These changes|243326001|263703002
appear
associated|47429007
with a disordered state|64572001|398070004
of the endothelial glycocalyx,|27168002|19052001
which
acts
as a molecular filter|290005005|116250002|290005005|258648006
of blood components.|54790000|261226001

Leaky capillaries|87952002|20982000
(
and
the critical phase|21191007
)
are
thought|88952004
to
be
caused|23981006|134198009
by a decrease|260400001|260370003
in the viral load|395058002
of blood|87612001|119273009
that
triggers
an immune system response.|35024006|246333005

Other processes|74964007|415178003
of interest|225469004
include|55919000
infected cells|4421005
that
become
necrotic?|6574001
which
affect|4065008
both
coagulation|129390001
and
fibrinolysis|385538006
(
the opposing systems|246333005
of blood clotting|75753009
and
clot degradation|387325003|40091007|75753009|40091007
)?
and
low platelets
in the blood,|87612001|119273009
also
a factor
in normal clotting.[24]|17621005|258744000

The diagnosis|439401001
of dengue|38362002
is
typically
made
clinically,
on the basis|418836005
of reported symptoms|229059009|223458004
and
physical examination|5880005
;
this applies especially|410618006|417924000
in endemic areas.|42798000

However,
early disease|264499004|64572001
can
be
difficult to|52925006
differentiate|263933003
from other viral infections.|34014006

A probable diagnosis|2931005
is
based|418836005
on the findings|404684003
of fever|386661006
plus
two|420797005
of the following|255260001
:
nausea|422587007
and
vomiting,|249497008
rash,|271807003
generalized pains,|82991003
low white blood cell count,|62482003|767002|62482003|365630000|371880002|767002|371880002|365630000
positive tourniquet test,|258758003|42106004|10828004|42106004
or
any warning sign|72670004
(
see|281004000
table|86407004
)
in someone
who
lives|224130005
in an endemic area.|42798000

Warning signs typically|72670004
occur|272120004
before the onset|77374008
of severe dengue.|24484000|38362002

The tourniquet test,|42106004
which
is
particularly useful
in settings
where no laboratory investigations|261904005|386053000
are
readily available,|103328004
involves|248448006
the application|410618006
of a blood pressure cuff|70665002
at
between the diastolic|90892000
and
systolic pressure|271649006
for five minutes,|421820001|258701004|421820001|255507004|421820001|356624006
followed|367409002
by the counting|258734002
of any petechial hemorrhages|423716004
;
a higher number|75540009|410680006|75540009|410681005|371879000|410680006|371879000|410681005
makes
a diagnosis|439401001
of dengue more likely.[8][26]|38362002|2931005

The diagnosis|439401001
should
be
considered
in anyone
who
develops
a fever|386661006
within two weeks|420797005|258705008
of
being
in the tropics
or
subtropics.

It
can
be
difficult to|52925006
distinguish
dengue fever|38362002
and
chikungunya,|111864006
a similar viral infection|34014006
that
shares
many symptoms
and
occurs|272120004
in similar parts|260726005
of the world
to dengue.|38362002

Often,|70232002
investigations|386053000
are
performed|398166005
to
exclude|77765009
other conditions|74964007|260905004
that
cause|23981006|134198009
similar symptoms,
such as malaria,|248437004
leptospirosis,|77377001
viral hemorrhagic fever,|240523007
typhoid fever,|4834000
meningococcal disease,|23511006
measles,|14189004
and
influenza.[5][27]|6142004|396425006

The earliest|264499004
change|243326001|263703002
detectable
on laboratory investigations|261904005|386053000
is
a low white blood cell count,|62482003|767002|62482003|365630000|371880002|767002|371880002|365630000
which
may
then
be
followed|367409002
by low platelets
and
metabolic acidosis.|59455009

A moderately elevated level|75540009|258395000|75540009|276625007
of aminotransferase|130093006
from the liver|10200004|181268008
is
commonly
associated|47429007
with low platelets
and
white blood cells.|767002|52501007

In severe disease,|24484000|64572001
plasma leakage|419185008|76676007
results|394617004
in hemoconcentration
(
as
indicated|410535002
by a rising hematocrit|28317006|365616005
and
hypoalbuminemia.|119247004

Pleural effusions|60046008
or
ascites|271861000
can
be
detected|260373001
by physical examination|5880005
when
large,[5]|255509001
but
the demonstration
of fluid|32457005|33463005|255765007
on ultrasound|359659005
may
assist|116697009|119265000
in the early identification|264499004|286672002|264499004|7882003
of dengue shock syndrome.|409671005

The use|277889008|419385000
of ultrasound|359659005
is
limited|255469002
by lack|41277001
of availability|103328004
in many settings.

Dengue shock syndrome|409671005
occurs|272120004
if pulse pressure|410194008|279046003|410194008|13543005|410194008|257893003|78564009|279046003|78564009|13543005|78564009|257893003|8499008|279046003|8499008|13543005|8499008|257893003
drops|426684005|404218003
to ? 20 mm Hg|304621005
while
peripheral vascular collapse|14414005|27942005
is
evidenced.[7]|18669006

The World Health Organization's 2009 classification|263775005|21139007|73504009
divides|422033008
dengue fever|38362002
into two groups|420797005|261586004|420797005|160481000
:
uncomplicated|263914008
and
severe.|24484000

This replaces|282089006|370124000
the 1997
WHO classification,|73504009
which
needed|410525008|103325001
to
be
simplified
as
it
had
been
found|404684003
to
be
too restrictive,
though
the older classification|70753007|73504009
is
still widely
used.|394850002

Severe dengue|24484000|38362002
is
defined
as that
associated|47429007
with severe bleeding,|24484000|131148009
severe organ dysfunction,|24484000|410653004|386585008
or
severe plasma leakage|24484000|419185008|76676007
while
all other cases|74964007|398241000|74964007|413769002
are
uncomplicated.|263914008

The 1997 classification|73504009
divided|422033008
dengue|38362002
into undifferentiated fever,|263918006|386661006
dengue fever,|38362002
and
dengue hemorrhagic fever.|20927009

Dengue hemorrhagic fever|20927009
was
subdivided
further|46053002
into grades I?IV.

Grade I
is
the presence only|386397008
of easy bruising|424131007
or
a positive tourniquet test|258758003|42106004|10828004|42106004
in someone
with fever,|386661006
grade II|1663004
is
the presence|386397008
of spontaneous bleeding|5054005|131148009
into the skin|119325001|39937001|181469002
and
elsewhere,
grade III|263843001
is
the clinical evidence|58147004|18669006
of shock,|27942005
and
grade IV|258349007|371469007
is
shock|27942005
so severe|223528007|24484000
that blood pressure|75367002|392570002|386536003
and
pulse|410194008|78564009|8499008
cannot
be
detected.|260373001

Grades|258349007
III|257471003
and
IV
are
referred|439980006
to
as
"dengue shock syndrome".[25][28]|409671005

Dengue fever|38362002
may
be
diagnosed|439401001
by microbiological laboratory testing.|269814003

This
can
be
done
by virus isolation|49872002|40174006|49872002|46651001|40174006|46651001
in cell cultures,|4421005|252398009|4421005|61594008|362837007|252398009|362837007|61594008
nucleic acid detection|398545005
by PCR,|258066000|103338009
viral antigen detection|121276004
or
specific antibodies|404263002
(serology|68793005
).

Virus isolation|49872002|40174006|49872002|46651001|40174006|46651001
and
nucleic acid detection|398545005
are
more accurate|242762006|263656005
than antigen detection,|121276004
but
these tests|269814003|272393004
are
not widely available|103328004
due to their greater cost.|263768009

All tests|269814003|272393004
may
be
negative|260385009
in the early stages|264499004|261612004
of the disease.|64572001

PCR|258066000|103338009
and
viral antigen detection|121276004
are
more accurate|242762006|263656005
in the first seven days.|255216001|420359007|258703001|232714002|420359007|258703001

In 2012
a PCR test|258066000|269814003|258066000|258066000|272393004|103338009|269814003|103338009|103338009|272393004
was
introduced|127487003
that
can
run on equipment|418060005|246137000|282476009|246137000
used|394850002
to
diagnose|439401001
influenza|6142004|396425006
;
this
is
likely to|2931005
improve|385425000|3442003|385633008
access|260507000
to PCR-based diagnosis.[29]|258066000|439401001|258066000|258066000|418836005|439401001|258066000|418836005|103338009|439401001|103338009|103338009|418836005|439401001|103338009|418836005

These laboratory tests|269814003
are
only
of diagnostic value|439401001|261004008
during the acute phase|255251009
of the illness|39104002
with the exception
of serology.|68793005

Tests|269814003|272393004
for dengue virus-specific antibodies,|120734004|69658003
types IgG|261664005
and
IgM,
can
be
useful
in confirming|59156000
a diagnosis|439401001
in the later stages|260383002|261612004
of the infection.

Both
IgG
and
IgM
are
produced
after 5?7 days.|264706000|258703001|264605009|258703001

The highest levels|75540009|258395000|371879000|258395000
(titres|118590008
of IgM
are
detected|260373001
following|255260001
a primary infection,|63161005|261424001
but
IgM
is
also
produced
in secondary|2603003|81170007
and
tertiary infections.|84965000

The IgM
becomes
undetectable 30?90 days|264705001|258703001|264703008|258703001
after a primary infection,|63161005|261424001
but
earlier|264499004
following|255260001
re-infections.|228877007

IgG,
by contrast,
remains
detectable
for over 60 years|21481007|258707000
and
,
in the absence|2667000|418560003
of symptoms,
is
a useful indicator
of past infection.|410513005

After a primary infection|63161005|261424001
the IgG
reaches|282679008
peak levels|255587001
in the blood|87612001|119273009
after 14?21 days.|258703001

In subsequent re-infections,|255260001|228877007
levels peak earlier|258395000|255587001|264499004
and
the titres|118590008
are
usually higher.|75540009|371879000

Both
IgG
and
IgM
provide
protective immunity|58915005
to the infecting serotype|276770009
of the virus.|49872002

In the laboratory test|269814003
the IgG
and
the IgM antibodies|68498002
can
cross-react|65145006
with other flaviviruses,|74964007|28375005
such as yellow fever virus,|26630006
which
can
make
the interpretation|280452008
of the serology|68793005
difficult.|52925006

The detection
of IgG
alone|105529008
is
not
considered
diagnostic|439401001|261004008
unless
blood samples|119297000
are
collected
14 days apart|258703001
and
a greater|263768009
than fourfold increase|260366006
in levels|258395000
of specific IgG|69658003
is
detected.|260373001

In a person|125676002
with symptoms,
the detection
of IgM
is
considered diagnostic.[30]|439401001|261004008

There
are
no approved vaccines|9571008|398827000
for the dengue virus.|34348001

Prevention thus|169443000
depends
on control|31509003
of
and
protection
from the bites|3404009
of the mosquito|359768004
that transmits|60117003
it.

The World Health Organization|263775005|21139007
recommends
an Integrated Vector Control program|275824000
consisting
of five elements|421820001|57795002
:
(1
)
Advocacy,|372038002
social mobilization|183376001
and
legislation to
ensure
that public health bodies|310115006|279495008|310115006|123037004
and
communities|133928008
are
strengthened
,
(2
)
collaboration
between the health|263775005
and
other sectors|74964007|255505007
(public
and
private
)
,
(3
)
an integrated approach
to disease control to|64572001|31509003
maximize
use|277889008|419385000
of resources,
(4
)
evidence-based decision making to|18669006|247583006|18669006|418836005|247583006
ensure
any interventions|225334002
are
targeted
appropriately
and
(5
)
capacity-
building
to
ensure
an adequate response|51117008|88323005
to the local situation.[15]|255470001

The primary method|63161005|260686004|63161005|272394005|261424001|260686004|261424001|272394005
of controlling _A.|54776003|31509003

aegypti_
is
by eliminating
its habitats.

This
is
done
by emptying containers|69251000
of water|11713004|119318008
or
by adding insecticides|33278000
or
biological control agents|31509003
to these areas,|42798000
[15]
although
spraying|55573003
with organophosphate|301785006
or
pyrethroid insecticides|311846002
is
not
thought|88952004
to
be
effective.|255403003|254648000

Reducing|260400001
open collections|56116003
of water|11713004|119318008
through environmental modification|276339004|243326001
is
the preferred method|225773000|260686004|225773000|272394005
of control,|31509003
given|419582001
the concerns
of negative health effect|260385009|263775005|253861007
from insecticides|33278000
and
greater logistical difficulties|263768009|371157007
with control agents.|31509003|260872001

People|125676002
can
prevent
mosquito bites|242635009
by wearing
clothing|272180002
that fully
covers|255334000
the skin,|119325001|39937001|181469002
using|260676000
mosquito netting|359768004
while
resting,|258157001
and/or
the application|410618006
of insect repellent|75627006
(DEET|16968005
being
the most effective|4757001|255403003|4757001|254648000
).[18]

There
are
no specific treatments|69658003|276239002
for dengue fever.|38362002

Treatment|276239002|416118004
depends
on the symptoms,
varying
from oral rehydration therapy|243222002
at home|261770009
with close follow-up,|29179001|308273005
to hospital admission|32485007
with administration|413454004|416118004
of intravenous fluids|118431008
and/or
blood transfusion.

A decision
for hospital admission|32485007
is
typically
based|418836005
on the presence|386397008
of the "warning signs"|72670004
listed
in the table above, especially|86407004
in those with preexisting health conditions.[5]|20401003|102478008|263775005|421463005|102478008|263775005

Intravenous hydration|405006006|255560000|405006006
is
usually only
needed|410525008|103325001
for one|421379005
or
two days.|420797005|258703001

The rate
of fluid administration|32457005|413454004|32457005|416118004|33463005|413454004|33463005|416118004|255765007|413454004|255765007|416118004|413454004|416118004
is
titrated
to a urinary output|130953005
of 0.5?1 mL/kg/hr,|260316000|259035002|414559001
stable vital signs|58158008|61746007|58158008|46680005
and
normalization
of hematocrit.|28317006|365616005

Invasive medical procedures
such as nasogastric intubation,|87750000
intramuscular injections|76601001
and
arterial punctures|57931004
are
avoided
,
in view|246516004
of the bleeding risk.|131148009|30207005

Paracetamol|387517004
(acetaminophen|387517004
)
is
used|394850002
for fever|386661006
and
discomfort|367391008|87128005
while
NSAIDs|372665008
such as ibuprofen|387207008

aspirin|387458008
are
avoided
as
they
might
aggravate|162473008

Blood transfusion
is
initiated early|264499004
in patients|116154003
presenting|246105001
with unstable vital signs|263922001|61746007|263922001|46680005
in the face|89545001|302549007
of a _decreasing hematocrit_,|260371004|28317006|260371004|365616005

Packed red blood cells|431069006
or
whole blood|420135007
are
recommended
,
while
platelets|16378004
and
fresh frozen plasma|346447007
are
usually
not.[33]|264667004

During the recovery phase intravenous fluids|21191007|118431008
are
discontinued|410546004
to
prevent
a state|398070004
of fluid|32457005|33463005|255765007
overload.

If fluid|32457005|33463005|255765007
overload
occurs|272120004
and
vital signs|61746007|46680005

may
be
all that
is
needed.|410525008|103325001

If
a person|125676002
is
outside of the critical phase,|21191007
a loop diuretic|372691009
such as furosemide|387475002
may
be
used|394850002
to
eliminate
excess fluid|423666004|21639008
from the circulation.[33]|413854007|264667004

Most people|125676002
with dengue|38362002
recover|74822006
without any ongoing problems.|255238004|55607006

The mortality|409651001
is
1?5%|264623001
without treatment,|276239002|416118004

Dengue|38362002
is
endemic
in more|242762006
than 110 countries.|223369002

It
infects
50
to 100 million people worldwide|125676002
a year,|258707000|259039008
leading|236874000
to half
a million hospitalizations,|394656005
[1]|260305007
and
approximately 12,500?25,000 deaths.[6][34]|26175008|419620001|26175008|268923008

The most common viral disease|4757001|72906007|34014006
transmitted|60117003|258150004
by arthropods,|106762008
[13] dengue|38362002
has
a disease burden|64572001
estimated|414135002
to
be
1600 disability-adjusted life years|21134002|410617001|224130005|258707000
per million population,|385436007|389109008
which
is
similar
to other childhood|74964007|68433009
and
tropical diseases|64572001
such as tuberculosis.|371569005

As a tropical disease dengue|64572001|38362002
is
deemed only second|81170007|257997001|288495006
in importance
to malaria,|248437004
[5]|264706000|264605009
though
the World Health Organization|263775005|21139007
counts|258734002
dengue|38362002
as one|421379005
of sixteen neglected tropical diseases.[35]|95930005|64572001

The incidence
of dengue|38362002
increased|35105006|260366006
30 fold|26310004
between 1960
and
2010.

This increase|260366006
is
believed to
be
due to a combination|89780004
of urbanization,
population growth,|385436007|389109008
increased|35105006|260366006
international travel,|420008001
and
global warming.|60132005

The geographical distribution|255464007
is
around the equator
with 70%
of the total 2.5 billion people|258755000|125676002|255619001|125676002
living|224130005|419749002
in endemic areas|42798000
from Asia|223500001
and
the Pacific.

In the United States,|223688001
the rate
of dengue infection|38362002
among those
who
return|7528007
from an endemic area|42798000
with a fever|386661006
is
2.9?8.0%,|260306008
[18]
and
it
is
the second most common infection|264569006|72906007
after malaria to|248437004
be
diagnosed|439401001
in this group.[9]|261586004|160481000|389109008

Until 2003,
dengue|38362002
was
classified|73504009
as a potential bioterrorism agent,|30207005|260872001
but
subsequent reports|255260001|229059009|255260001|223458004
removed|127485006
this classification|73504009
as
it
was
deemed
too difficult to|52925006
transfer|129347002|302265009|129005007
and
only
caused hemorrhagic fever|23981006|240523007|134198009|240523007
in a relatively small proportion|255507004|8212001
of people.[37]|125676002

Like most arboviruses,|281165003
dengue virus|34348001
is
maintained|385630006
in nature|277302009
in cycles|44180009
that
involve|248448006
preferred blood-sucking vectors|225773000|87612001|90485000|260529001|225773000|119273009|90485000|260529001
and
vertebrate hosts.|387967000

The viruses|49872002
are
maintained|385630006
in the forests|257616009
of Southeast Asia|223585008
and
Africa|223498002
by transmission|258150004
from female _Aedes_ mosquitoes?|248152002|57637003|359768004|224526002|57637003|359768004
of species|69658003
other than _A.

aegypti_?
to her offspring|160499008
and
to
lower|261122009
primates.|388073004

In rural settings
the virus|49872002
is
transmitted|60117003|258150004
to humans|278412004
by _A.

aegypti_
and
other species|74964007|69658003
of _Aedes_|57637003
such as _[A.

albopictus]
(/wiki/Aedes_albopictus|71803001
)
_.

In towns|288521009
and
cities,|284560003
the virus|49872002
is
primarily
transmitted|60117003|258150004
to humans|278412004
by _A.

aegypti_,
which
is
highly|75540009
domesticated.

In all settings
the infected lower primates|261122009|388073004
or
humans greatly|278412004
increase|260366006
the number|410680006|410681005
of circulating dengue viruses.|65929005|34348001

This
is
called amplification.

The urban cycle|224807002|44180009
is
the most important|4757001
to infections
of humans|278412004
and
dengue infections|38362002
are
primarily
confined
to towns|288521009
and
cities.|284560003

In recent decades,|6493001
the expansion
of villages,|224806006
towns|288521009
and
cities|284560003
in endemic areas,|42798000
and
the increased mobility|35105006|363803005|35105006|246197003|260366006|363803005|260366006|246197003
of humans|278412004
has
increased|35105006|260366006
the number|410680006|410681005
of epidemics
and
circulating viruses.|65929005|49872002

Dengue fever,|38362002
which
was
once
confined
to Southeast Asia,|223585008
has
now
spread|410677005
to Southern China,|223581004
countries|223369002
in the Pacific Ocean|223501002
and
America,
[39]
and
might
pose
a threat
to Europe.[3]|223502009

The first record|255216001|232714002
of a case|398241000
of probable dengue fever|2931005|38362002
is
in a Chinese medical encyclopedia|297876005|74188005|33897005|74188005
from the Jin Dynasty
(265?420 AD
)
which
referred|439980006
to a "water poison"|11713004|35331000|119318008|35331000
associated|47429007
with flying insects.|257736002|106763003

There
have
been
descriptions
of epidemics
in the 17th century,
but
the most plausible early reports|4757001|264499004|229059009|4757001|264499004|223458004
of dengue epidemics|38362002
are
from 1779
and
1780,
when
an epidemic swept Asia,|223500001
Africa|223498002
and
North America.|223503004

From
that time|410669006
until 1940,
epidemics
were
infrequent.[41]|84638005

In 1906,
transmission|258150004
by the _Aedes_ mosquitoes|57637003|359768004
was
confirmed|59156000
,
and
in 1907 dengue|38362002
was
the second disease|48873002
(
after yellow fever|16541001
)
that
was
shown
to
be
caused|23981006|134198009
by a virus.|49872002

Further investigations|46053002|386053000
by John Burton Cleland
and
Joseph Franklin Siler
completed|255594003
the basic understanding|66216009|418836005|66216009
of dengue transmission.[42]|38362002|258150004

The marked|46998006
spread|410677005
of dengue|38362002
during
and
after the Second World War|81170007|257997001|288495006
has
been
attributed|246061005
to ecologic disruption.|76555007

The same trends also|262126009|30294006
led|88488004|236874000
to the
spread|410677005
of different serotypes|263735002|276770009
of the disease|64572001
to new areas,|7147002|42798000
and
to the emergence
of dengue hemorrhagic fever.|20927009

This severe form|24484000|246176004
of the disease|64572001
was
first|255216001|232714002
reported|229059009|223458004
in the Philippines|223592003
in 1953
;
by the 1970s,
it
had
become
a major cause|255603008|23981006|255603008|134198009
of child mortality|410601007|409651001|160499008|409651001
and
had
emerged
in the Pacific
and
the Americas.

Dengue hemorrhagic fever|20927009
and
dengue shock syndrome|409671005
were
first|255216001|232714002
noted
in Central|26216008
and
South America|223504005
in 1981,
as
DENV-2
was
contracted|78558002
by people|125676002
who
had
previously
been
infected
with DENV-1 several years earlier.[12]|258707000|264499004

The origins|255395001
of the word "dengue"|255373000|38362002
are
not
clear|263707001
,
but
one theory|421379005
is
that
it
is
derived
from the Swahili phrase _Ka-dinga pepo_,
which
describes
the disease|64572001
as
being
caused|23981006|134198009
by an evil spirit.|6524003|422259002

The Swahili word _dinga_|255373000
may
possibly|60022001
have
its origin|255395001
in the Spanish word _dengue_,|255373000|38362002
meaning|255586005
fastidious
or
careful,
which
would
describe
the gait|271705001
of a person|125676002
suffering
the bone pain|12584003
of dengue fever.|38362002

However,
it
is
possible|371930009|60022001
that
the use|277889008|419385000
of the Spanish word|255373000
derived
from the similar-sounding Swahili.|118448000

Slaves
in the West Indies
having
contracted dengue|78558002|38362002
were
said|66049007
to
have
the posture|363855006
and
gait|271705001
of a dandy,
and
the disease|64572001
was
known|36692007
as "dandy fever".[44][45]|38362002

The term "breakbone fever"|38362002
was
first|255216001|232714002
applied|410618006
by physician|309343006
and
United States|223688001
Founding
Father Benjamin Rush,|66839005|261702002|262118001
in a 1789 report|229059009|223458004
of the 1780 epidemic
in Philadelphia.

In the report|229059009|223458004
he
uses|277889008|394850002|260676000|419385000
primarily
the more formal term "bilious remitting fever".|242762006|246176004|255319006|386661006

The term dengue fever|38362002
came
into general use only|60132005|277889008|60132005|419385000
after 1828.

Other historical terms|74964007|74964007|392521001
include|55919000
"breakheart fever"|386661006
and
"la dengue".|38362002

Terms
for severe disease|24484000|64572001
include|55919000
"infectious thrombocytopenic purpura"|302873008
and
"Philippine",
"Thai",|83365001
or
"Singapore hemorrhagic fever".[45]|223593008|240523007

Research efforts to|19487008
prevent
and
treat|395077000
dengue|38362002
include|55919000
various means|256220008|255586005
of vector control,|275824000
[47] vaccine development,|398827000|278923009
and
antiviral drugs.[31]|372701006|264664006

With
regards
to vector control,|275824000
a number|410680006|410681005
of novel methods|7147002|260686004|7147002|272394005
have
been
used|394850002
to
reduce|260400001
mosquito numbers|359768004|410680006|359768004|410681005
with some success|385669000
including|55919000
the placement|257867005
of the guppy|84872000
(_Poecilia reticulata_|84872000

or
copepods|420320003
in standing water to|10904000|11713004|10904000|119318008
eat|48263008
the mosquito larvae.|359768004

Attempts
are
ongoing|255238004
to
infect
the mosquito population|359768004|385436007|359768004|389109008
with bacteria|409822003
of the _Wolbachia_ genus,|415847004|18511007
which
makes
the mosquitoes|359768004
partially resistant|30714006
to dengue virus.[7]|34348001

There
are
ongoing programs|255238004
working|261041009
on a dengue vaccine to|38362002|398827000
cover|255334000
all four serotypes.|421534005|276770009

One|421379005
of the concerns
is
that
a vaccine|398827000
could
increase|260366006
the risk|30207005
of severe disease|24484000|64572001
through antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE).|68498002|371154000|418393006|112133008|371154000|418393006

The ideal vaccine|398827000
is
safe, effective|255403003|254648000

covers|255334000
all serotypes,|276770009
does
not
contribute
to ADE,
is
easily|36203004
transported|57188001|360300001
and
stored,|440276004
and
is
both affordable
and
cost-effective.|255403003|254648000

As of 2012,
a number|410680006|410681005
of vaccines|398827000
were
undergoing testing.|272393004

The most|4757001
developed
is
based|418836005
on a weakened combination|89780004
of the yellow fever virus|26630006
and
each
of the four dengue serotypes.|421534005|38362002|276770009

It
is
hoped
that
the first products|255216001|232714002
will
be
commercially available|103328004
by 2015.[31]|264664006

Apart from attempts to
control|31509003
the
spread|410677005
of the _Aedes_ mosquito|57637003|359768004
and
work|261041009
to
develop
a vaccine|398827000
against dengue,|38362002
there
are
ongoing efforts to|255238004|19487008
develop
antiviral drugs|372701006
that
would
be
used|394850002
to
treat|395077000
attacks|216299002
of dengue fever|38362002
and
prevent
severe complications.|24484000|116223007

Discovery
of the structure
of the viral proteins|88878007
may
aid|246088000
the development|278923009
of effective drugs.|255403003|410942007|254648000|410942007

There
are
several plausible targets.|261028005

The first approach|255216001|232714002
is
inhibition|61511001|419495008
of the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase|43751004
(
coded
by NS5
)
,
which
copies
the viral genetic material,|256926007
with nucleoside analogs.|47368004

Secondly,|81170007
it
may
be
possible to|371930009|60022001
develop
specific inhibitors|69658003|61511001
of the viral protease|116536008
(
coded
by NS3
)
,
which
splices|85030005
viral proteins.|88878007

Finally,
it
may
be
possible to|371930009|60022001
develop
entry inhibitors,|61511001
which
stop|422117008
the virus entering cells,|49872002|417985001|4421005|417985001|4421005
or
inhibitors|61511001
of the 5?|264706000|264605009
capping process,|228254002|415178003
which
is
required
for viral replication.[50]|74256009
