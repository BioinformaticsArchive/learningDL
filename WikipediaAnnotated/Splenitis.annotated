*Splenomegaly|16294009
*
*
is
an enlargement|56246009|118452000|442021009
of the spleen.|78961009|181279003

The spleen usually|78961009|181279003
lies|40199007|255576009
in the left upper quadrant (LUQ)|255481003
of the human abdomen.|278412004|277112006|278412004|52731004|278412004|302553009

It
is
one|421379005
of the four cardinal signs|421534005|62375001|72670004
of _hypersplenism_,|58381000
some reduction|58294000|260400001|289928003
in the number|410680006|410681005
of circulating blood cells|256914002|4421005|65929005|63370004
affecting|247591002|248448006
granulocytes,|256909001
erythrocytes|14089001|41898006
or
platelets|16378004
in any combination|89780004
;
a compensatory proliferative response|30217000
in the bone marrow|279729006
;
and
the potential|30207005
for correction
of these abnormalities|276654001
by splenectomy.|234319005

Splenomegaly|16294009
is
usually
associated|47429007
with increased workload|35105006|260366006
(
such as
in hemolytic anemias,|61261009
which
suggests
that
it
is
a response
to hyperfunction.

It
is
therefore
not
surprising
that splenomegaly|16294009
is
associated|47429007
with any disease process|64572001|415178003
that
involves|248448006
abnormal red blood cells|397019006
being
destroyed
in the spleen.|78961009|181279003

Other common causes|74964007|72906007|134198009
include|55919000
congestion|85804007
due to portal hypertension|34742003
and
infiltration|47351003|231287002
by leukemias|87163000
and
lymphomas.|118600007

Thus,
the finding|404684003
of an enlarged spleen|16294009
;
along
with caput medusa|111294009
;
is
an important sign|72670004
of portal hypertension.|34742003

[1]|260305007

Alotaibi G|258795003
et
al.

classify|73504009
splenomegaly|16294009
as
:

Splenomegaly|16294009
should
not
be
confused|286933003
with hypersplenism.|58381000

The former|9130008
is
a statement
about the size|277049003
of the spleen,|78961009|181279003
and
the latter
about the spleen's function|78961009|246464006|181279003|246464006
:
these
may
coexist,
or
they
may
not.

Clinically
if
a spleen|78961009|181279003
is
palpable,|103357000
it means|255586005
it
is
enlarged|260376009|118452000
as
it
has
to
undergo
enlargement|56246009|118452000|442021009
by
at least two|276139006|420797005|263796003|420797005
folds|26310004
to
become
palpable.|103357000

However,
the tip|233445008
of the spleen|78961009|181279003
may
be
palpable|103357000
in a newborn baby|133933007
up to 3 months|260313008|258706009
of age.|424144002

Symptoms
may
include|55919000
abdominal pain,|21522001
chest pain,|29857009
chest pain|29857009
similar
to pleuritic pain|2237002
when
stomach,|69695003|181246003
bladder|89837001|302512001
or
bowels|261093006
are
full, back pain,|261015003|22913005
early satiety|442076002
due to splenic encroachment,|78961009
or
the symptoms
of anemia|271737000
due to accompanying cytopenia.|50820005

Signs|72670004
of splenomegaly|16294009
may
include|55919000
a palpable left upper quadrant abdominal mass|443607001|255481003|277112006|443607001|7771000|26983001|103357000|255481003|271860004
or
splenic rub.|78961009

It
can
be
detected|260373001
on physical examination|5880005
by
using|260676000
Castell's sign|72670004
or
Traube's space,
but
an ultrasound|359659005
can
be
used|394850002
to
confirm|59156000
diagnosis.|439401001

In patients|116154003
where the likelihood|2931005
of splenomegaly|16294009
is
high,|75540009|371879000
the physical exam|5880005
is
not sufficiently sensitive to|83185005
detect|260373001
it
;
abdominal imaging|277112006|363679005|277112006|278395004
is
indicated|410535002
in such patients.[2]|116154003

The most common causes|4757001|72906007|134198009
of splenomegaly|16294009
in developed countries|223369002
are
infectious mononucleosis,|271558008
splenic infiltration|78961009|47351003|78961009|231287002
with cancer cells|88400008
from a hematological malignancy|129154003
and
portal hypertension|34742003
(most commonly secondary|4757001|2603003|4757001|81170007
to liver disease,|235856003
and
Sarcoidosis|31541009
).

Splenomegaly|16294009
may
also
come
from bacterial infections,|301811001
such as syphilis|76272004
or
an infection
of the heart's inner lining|80891009|260521003|50009006|302509004|260521003|50009006

The causes|134198009
of massive splenomegaly|46998006|16294009
(
>1000 g|258795003
)
are
much fewer|242762006|4757001
and
include|55919000
:

If
the splenomegaly|16294009
underlies|255546002
hypersplenism,|58381000
a splenectomy|234319005
is
indicated|410535002
and
will
correct
the hypersplenism.|58381000

However,
the underlying cause|134198009
of the hypersplenism|58381000
will
most likely|4757001|2931005
remain
;
consequently,
a thorough diagnostic workup|439401001|261004008
is
still
indicated,|410535002
as
,
leukemia,|87163000
lymphoma|118600007
and
other serious disorders|74964007|42745003|64572001
can
cause|23981006|134198009
hypersplenism|58381000
and
splenomegaly.|16294009

After splenectomy,|234319005
however,
patients|116154003
have
an increased risk|35105006|30207005|260366006|30207005
for infectious diseases.|191415002

Patients|116154003
undergoing
splenectomy|234319005
should
be
vaccinated
against _Haemophilus influenzae_,|44470000
_Streptococcus pneumoniae_,|9861002
and
_Meningococcus_.|17872004

They
should
also
receive
annual influenza vaccinations.|53281000|86198006|53281000

Long-term prophylactic antibiotics
may
be
given|419582001
in certain cases.|17162000|398241000|17162000|413769002
