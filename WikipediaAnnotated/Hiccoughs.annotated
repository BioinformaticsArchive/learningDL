*HIK
*
*-?p_|20304007
is
a contraction|78558002
of the diaphragm|263734003|336704008|181614006
that
may
repeat|27582007
several times|261028005|410669006|261028005|417929005
per minute.|258701004|255507004|286549009|356624006

In medicine|410942007
it
is
known|36692007
as
*
*synchronous diaphragmatic flutter** (SDF),|255237009|90674006
or
*
*singultus|65958008
*
*,
from the Latin _singult_,
"
the
act
of catching one's breath|248584002|421379005
while
sobbing".|28263002

The hiccup|65958008
is
an involuntary action|129264002
involving|248448006
a reflex arc.|87572000|106146005

Once
triggered|410658008
,
the reflex|87572000|106146005
causes|134198009
a strong contraction|260404005|78558002
of the diaphragm|263734003|336704008|181614006
followed|367409002
about 0.25 seconds|257997001
later|260383002
by closure|112695004
of the vocal cords,|46105003
which
results|394617004
in the classic|255301002|255333006
*
*hic
*
* sound.|68325009

At the same time,|262126009|410669006
the normal peristalsis|17621005|28423000|258744000|28423000
of the esophagus|32849002|181245004
is
suppressed.|245780008

Hiccups|65958008
may
occur|272120004
individually,
or
they
may
occur|272120004
in bouts.

The rhythm|272121000
of the hiccup,|65958008
or
the time|410669006
between hiccups,|65958008
tends
to
be
relatively constant.

A bout
of hiccups,|65958008
in general,|60132005
resolves
itself
without intervention,|225334002
although
many home remedies|261770009
are
often|70232002
used to|394850002
attempt
to
shorten|129350004|359530003
the duration.|103335007

Medical treatment|74188005|276239002|74188005|416118004
is
occasionally necessary
in cases|398241000|413769002
of chronic hiccups.|90734009|65958008

Researchers
at the Respiratory Research Group|258162000|261586004|258162000|160481000|258162000|389109008|449071006|261586004|449071006|160481000|449071006|389109008
at the University of Calgary|224871002
in Alberta,|224013005
Canada,|223686002
propose
that
the hiccup|65958008
is
an evolutionary remnant
of earlier amphibian respiration.|264499004|387970001|258162000

Amphibians|387970001
such as tadpoles|14874006
gulp
air|417696007
and
water|11713004|119318008
across their gills|39676003
via a rather simple motor reflex akin|13673007|87572000|13673007|106146005
to mammalian hiccuping.|387976007|65958008

In support|9096001|243114000
of this idea,|363878000
they
observe
that
the motor pathways
that
enable|225791005
hiccuping form early|65958008|246176004|264499004
during fetal development,|278923009
before
the motor pathways
that
enable|225791005
normal lung ventilation form.|258749005|266700009

Thus,
according to recapitulation theory
the hiccup|65958008
is
evolutionarily antecedent
to modern lung respiration.|449071006

Additionally,
they
point
out
that hiccups|65958008
and
amphibian gulping|387970001
are
inhibited|61511001
by elevated CO2|75540009|421982008|75540009|38007001
and
may
be
stopped|385654001
by GABAB receptor agonists,|116647005|102498003
illustrating
a possible shared physiology|371930009|1360005|60022001|1360005
and
evolutionary heritage.

These proposals
may
explain
why premature infants|395507008
spend
2.5%|264655001
of their time hiccuping,|410669006|65958008
possibly gulping|60022001
like amphibians,|387970001
as
their lungs|39607008
are
not yet fully
formed.|35810008

Fetal intrauterine hiccups|398236008|65958008
are
of two types.|420797005|261664005

The physiological type|1360005|261664005
occurs|272120004
prior to twenty-eight weeks|421825006|258705008
after conception|13693004
and
tend
to
last
five|421820001
to
ten|23067006|420258001
minutes.|258701004|255507004|356624006

These hiccups|65958008
are
part|260726005
of fetal development|278923009
and
are
associated|47429007
with the myelination|23879005
of the phrenic nerve,|50230006|280344009
which primarily
controls|54776003|31509003
the thoracic diaphragm.|263734003

The phylogeny hypothesis
explains
how
the hiccup reflex|65958008|87572000|65958008|106146005
might
have
evolved|59381007
,
and
if there
is
not
an alternate explanation|49572008
it
may
explain
hiccups|65958008
as an evolutionary remnant,
held-|421139008
over|21481007
from our amphibious ancestors.

This hypothesis
has
been
questioned
because of the existence
of the afferent loop|49530007|261913007
of the reflex,|87572000|106146005
the fact
that
it
does
not
explain
the reason|410666004
for glottic closure,|119873001
and
because
the very short contraction|260358002|359530003|78558002|260358002|367450005|78558002
of the hiccup|65958008
is
unlikely to
have
a significant strengthening effect|386134007|253861007
on the slow-twitch muscles|419443000|60238002|91727004
of respiration.|258162000

A more recent explanation|242762006|6493001
by Howes
in 2012
suggests
that hiccups|65958008
may
have
evolved|59381007
along
with other reflexes|74964007|87572000|74964007|106146005
developed
in mammals|387976007
that
allow
them to
coordinate|162258009
suckling milk|288984009|3718001|288984009|119321005|288984009|70813002
and
breathing[4].|14910006|258162000

Hiccups|65958008
are
only
found|404684003
in mammals,|387976007
and
are
most common|4757001|72906007
in infants,|418119000
becoming
rarer|84638005|103356009
as mammals age.|387976007|424144002

This
may
suggest
that
they
evolved|59381007
to
allow
air|417696007
trapped|403833009
in the stomach|69695003|181246003
of suckling infants to|288984009|418119000
escape
,
allowing
more milk to|242762006|3718001|242762006|119321005|242762006|70813002
be
ingested.|111984006

The hypothesis
suggests
that
the air bubble|56117007
in the stomach|69695003|181246003
stimulates
the sensory limb|262139008|66019005|262139008|243996003
of the reflex|87572000|106146005
at receptors|116647005
in the stomach,|69695003|181246003
esophagus|32849002|181245004
and
along the diaphragm.|263734003|336704008|181614006

This
triggers
the hiccup,|65958008
which
creates
suction|274441001
in the chest,|261179002
pulling air|303370007|417696007
from the stomach|69695003|181246003
up
and
out
through the mouth,|74262004|123851003|21082005|181220002
effectively burping|275299008
the animal.|387961004

This theory
is
supported|9096001|243114000
by the strong tendency|260404005
for infants to|418119000
get
hiccups,|65958008
the component|246093002
of the reflex|87572000|106146005
that
suppresses|245780008
peristalsis|28423000
in the esophagus,|32849002|181245004
and
the existence
of hiccups only|65958008
in milk-drinking mammals.|3718001|160573003|387976007|3718001|30953006|387976007|119321005|160573003|387976007|119321005|30953006|387976007|70813002|160573003|387976007|70813002|30953006|387976007

Hiccups|65958008
may
be
triggered|410658008
by a number|410680006|410681005
of common human conditions.|72906007|278412004|260905004

Rarely,|103356009
they
can
be
a sign|72670004
of serious medical problems.|42745003|74188005|55607006

Clinical case reports|371524004|398241000
mention
that lesions
of the medulla|26519002|279104005
that
involve|248448006
the area|42798000
slightly ventral|425404009
and
lateral|49370004
to nucleus|84640000
and
tractus solitarius cause hiccups.|134198009|65958008

One|421379005
(
of several|261028005
)
explanations
for this finding|404684003
is
that
such a lesion ?irritates? descending information|75294000
from nucleus solitarius|61538008|369080003
to the phrenic nucleus.|263734003|84640000|336704008|84640000|84640000|181614006|84640000

The phrenic nucleus|263734003|84640000|336704008|84640000|84640000|181614006|84640000
consists
of a functionally related group|272151006|261586004|272151006|160481000|272151006|389109008|262094002|261586004|262094002|160481000|262094002|389109008
of cell bodies|4421005|279495008|4421005|123037004|362837007|279495008|362837007|123037004
in the ventral horn|69221006
from C3-C5.

Axons|60436000
arising|68727004
from the phrenic nucleus|263734003|84640000|336704008|84640000|84640000|181614006|84640000
comprise
the phrenic nerve,|50230006|280344009
which
innervates
the diaphragm.|263734003|336704008|181614006

The hiccups|65958008
result|394617004
from spasmodic lowering|45352006|261122009
of the diaphragm|263734003|336704008|181614006
that
causes|134198009
a short, sharp inspiratory cough.|359530003|410707003|14910006|272039006|367450005|410707003|14910006|272039006

Brain stem lesions|301766008
involving|248448006
the area|42798000
ventral
and
lateral|49370004
to nucleus|84640000
and
tractus solitarius result|394617004
in hiccup.[7]|65958008

Numerous medical remedies|260396001|74188005
exist
but
no particular treatment|276239002|416118004
is
known to|36692007
be
especially effective.|255403003|254648000

Many drugs|260396001|410942007
have
been
used|394850002
,
such as baclofen,|387342009
chlorpromazine,|387258005
metoclopramide,|372776000
gabapentin,|386845007
and
various proton-pump inhibitors.|256220008|372525000

Hiccups|65958008
that
are
secondary|2603003|81170007
to some other cause|74964007|134198009
like gastroesophageal reflux disease|235595009
or
esophageal webs|19216006|89199004
are
dealt
with
by treating|28995006
the underlying disorder.|64572001

Home treatment|261770009|276239002|261770009|416118004
like drinking water|160573003|11713004|160573003|119318008|30953006|11713004|30953006|119318008
is
effective.|255403003|254648000

A simple treatment|13673007|276239002|13673007|416118004
involves|248448006
increasing|260369004
the partial pressure|118585005
of CO2|421982008|38007001
and
inhibiting diaphragm activity|61511001|263734003|48761009|61511001|263734003|55561003|61511001|263734003|258745004|61511001|263734003|257733005|61511001|336704008|48761009|61511001|336704008|55561003|61511001|336704008|258745004|61511001|336704008|257733005|61511001|181614006|48761009|61511001|181614006|55561003|61511001|181614006|258745004|61511001|181614006|257733005
by holding|421139008
one?s breath|11891009
or
rebreathing
into a paper bag.|50833004|37284003

Vagus nerve stimulation|128968000
can
improve|385425000|3442003|385633008
hiccups,|65958008
done
at home|261770009
by irritating
the pharynx|54066008|181211006
through swallowing dry bread|54731003|13880007|226559002|288937009|13880007|226559002
or
crushed ice,|60726007|896008
or
by applying traction|410618006|66391000|417924000|66391000
to the tongue,|21974007|181226008
or
by stimulating
the gag reflex.|249488009

The phrenic nerve|50230006|280344009
can
be
blocked|26036001|112232007
temporarily
with injection|28289002|385218009|129326001
of 0.5% procaine,|260316000|387238009
or
permanently
with bilateral phrenicotomy|51440002|58378005
or
other forms|74964007|246176004
of surgical destruction.|83578000|64597002

Even
this rather drastic treatment|276239002|416118004
does
not
cure
some cases,|398241000|413769002
however.

In Plato's _Symposium_,
Aristophanes
has
a case|398241000
of the hiccups|65958008
and
is
advised|424900004
by Eryximachus,
a physician,|309343006
to
cure
them
by holding
his breath,|11891009
or
,
failing
that,
by gargling|31105004
or
provoking sneezing.|162367006

This ancient recommendation
can
be
compared
with the vagal nerve stimulation techniques|128968000|3057000|272394005|128968000|256864008|272394005
mentioned
previously.

An anecdotal medical approach|74188005
is
to
install
lidocaine liniment 3%|387480006|63316001
or
gel 2%|385100002
in the external ear.|181176000|420893000

Somehow
this
creates
a vagus nerve-|88882009
triggering|410658008
reflex|87572000|106146005
through its extensions|255536004
to the external ear|181176000|420893000
and
tympanus
(ear drum|42859004
).

The effect|253861007
can
be
immediate,|88694003|49499008
and
also
have
lasting effect|253861007
after the lidocaine effect|387480006|253861007
expires|58322009
after
about two hours.[10]|420797005|258702006

A solution|8537005|77899000
involving|248448006
sugar|2331003|74801000
placed|257557008|421066005
on
or
under the tongue|21974007|181226008
was
cited
in the December 23,|264657009
1971 issue|55607006
of the New England Journal|7147002|223664003
of Medicine.[11]|410942007

Hiccups|65958008
are
treated|28995006
medically only
in severe|24484000
and
persistent
(termed "intractable"|20646008
)
cases,|398241000|413769002
such as

with sedatives often|372614000|70232002
requires
a dose|277406006|408102007

renders
the person|125676002
either
unconscious|418107008

Hence,
medicating
with sedatives|372614000

for hiccuping|65958008
around 50 times|410669006|417929005

every two seconds,|420797005|257997001
12 hours|259028005|123035007
a day,|258703001|259032004
