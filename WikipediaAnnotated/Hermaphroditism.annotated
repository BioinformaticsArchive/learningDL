In biology,|12893009
a
*
*hermaphrodite|237821001
*
*
is
an organism|410653004
that
has
reproductive organs normally|410653004
associated|47429007
with
both
male|248153007
and
female sexes.[1]|248152002

Many taxonomic groups|261586004|160481000
of animals|387961004
(mostly
invertebrates|272608008
do
not
have
separate sexes_[citation|263869007|258139002|263869007|365952006|263869007|263495000|263869007|70256003|263869007|57312000

_].

In these groups,|261586004|160481000
hermaphroditism|237821001
is
a normal condition,|81323004
enabling|225791005
a form|246176004
of sexual reproduction|365952006|263767004
in which
both
partners|262043009
can
act
as the "female"|248152002|224526002
or
"male".|248153007

For example,
the great majority|255509001|263768009
of pulmonate snails,|15838006
opisthobranch snails|15838006
and
slugs|14138004
are
hermaphrodites.|237821001

Hermaphroditism|237821001
is
also
found|404684003
in some fish species|90580008|69658003
and
to a lesser degree|263796003|258395000|263796003|246173007
in other vertebrates.|74964007|387967000

Most plants|31006001
are
also hermaphrodites.|237821001

Historically,
the term _hermaphrodite_|237821001
has
also
been
used|394850002
to
describe
ambiguous genitalia|21321009
and
gonadal mosaicism|54285004
in individuals|125676002|385435006
of gonochoristic species,|69658003
especially human beings.|278412004

The word hermaphrodite|255373000|237821001
entered|417985001
the English lexicon|297487008|25804004
in the late 14th century,|260383002
derived
from Greek _????????????_ Hermaphroditos,|1451003
the son|65616008
of the Greek god Hermes|1451003
and
the goddess Aphrodite.

Recently,|6493001
the word _intersex_|255373000
has
come
into preferred usage|225773000|277889008
for humans,|278412004
since
the word _hermaphrodite_|255373000|237821001
is
considered to
be
misleading
and
stigmatizing,[3]
as well as
"scientifically specious
and
clinically problematic".[4]

Sequential hermaphrodites|237821001
(dichogamy
occur|272120004
in species|69658003
in which
the individual|125676002|385435006
is
born|106970005|81827009|398209006
as one sex,|421379005|258139002|421379005|365952006|421379005|263495000|421379005|70256003|421379005|57312000
but
can
later
change|243326001|263703002
into the opposite sex.|258139002|365952006|263495000|70256003|57312000

This
is
in contrast
with simultaneous hermaphrodites,|79970003|237821001
in which
an individual|125676002|385435006
may
possess
fully functional male|40143009|248153007|246464006|248153007
and
female gonads.|15497006

Sequential hermaphroditism|237821001
is
common|72906007
in fish|90580008
(particularly
teleost
fish|90580008
)
and
some jellyfish,|421819007
many gastropods|106878004
(
such as the common slipper shell,|72906007|228235002|44537007
and
some flowering plants.|420928000

While
some sequential hermaphrodites|237821001
can
change|243326001|263703002
sex multiple times,|258139002|260396001|410669006|258139002|260396001|417929005|365952006|260396001|410669006|365952006|260396001|417929005|263495000|260396001|410669006|263495000|260396001|417929005|70256003|260396001|410669006|70256003|260396001|417929005|57312000|260396001|410669006|57312000|260396001|417929005

once._[citation
needed|410525008|103325001
_] Sequential hermaphrodism|237821001
can
best
be
understood|66216009
in terms
of behavioral ecology|844005
and
evolutionary life history theory,|224130005|224130005|392521001
as
described
in the size-advantage model[6] first|277049003|255216001|277049003|232714002
proposed
by [Michael T.

Ghiselin]
(/wiki/Michael_T._Ghiselin
)
[7]
which
states|398070004
that
if
an individual|125676002|385435006
of a certain sex|17162000|258139002|17162000|365952006|17162000|263495000|17162000|70256003|17162000|57312000
could
significantly
increase|260366006
its reproductive success|385669000
after reaching|282679008
a certain size,|17162000|277049003
it
would
be
to their advantage to
switch
to
that sex.|258139002|365952006|263495000|70256003|57312000

Sequential hermaphrodites|237821001
can
be
divided|422033008
into three broad categories|421291004|90522003
:

Dichogamy
can
have
both
conservation-related implications|272151006|262094002
for humans,|278412004
as
mentioned
above,
as well as
economic implications.

For instance,
groupers
are
favoured
fish|90580008
for eating|48263008
in many Asian countries|223571003
and
are
often|70232002
aquacultured.

Since
the adults|133936004
take|419652001
several years to|261028005|258707000
change|243326001|263703002
from female|248152002|224526002
to male,|248153007
the broodstock
are
extremely valuable individuals.|125676002|385435006

A simultaneous|79970003
(
or
synchronous|255237009
)
hermaphrodite|237821001
(
or
homogamous
)
is
an adult organism|133936004|410653004
that
has
both
male|248153007
and
female sexual organs|248152002|365952006|410653004|224526002|365952006|410653004
at the same time.|262126009|410669006

Usually,
self-fertilization|55767001
does
not
occur.|272120004

When
spotted hyenas|78103009
were
first|255216001|232714002
discovered
by explorers,
they
were
thought|88952004
to
be
hermaphrodites.|237821001

Early observations|264499004|103705002
of spotted hyenas|78103009
in the wild lead researchers to|262290003|88488004
believe
that
all spotted hyenas,|78103009
male|248153007
and
female,|248152002|224526002
were
born|106970005|81827009|398209006
with what
appeared
to
be
a penis.|18911002|265793009

The apparent penis|18911002|265793009
in females|248152002
is
in fact
an enlarged clitoris,|80212005
which
contains|42504009
an external birth canal.|261074009|8389004

It
can
be
difficult to|52925006
determine
the sex|258139002|365952006|263495000|70256003|57312000
of wild spotted hyenas|262290003|78103009
until sexual maturity,|86571001
when
they
may
become
pregnant.|77386006|127362006

When
a female spotted hyena|248152002|78103009|224526002|78103009
gives|419582001
birth,|3950001
they
pass
the cub|223701004
through the cervix internally,|71252005|260521003
but
then
pass
it out|255529000
through the elongated clitoris.[12]|65439009|181442003

True hermaphroditism|18978002
in humans|278412004
differs
from pseudohermaphroditism|75164001
in which
the person's karyotype|125676002|312948004
has
both
XX|264680001
and
XY chromosome pairs,|91272006
having
both
testicular
and
ovarian tissue,|15497006|85756007|83238006|85756007|181464007|85756007
and
having
ambiguous-
looking|386548000
external genitalia.|45292006|77142006

One possible pathophysiologic explanation|421379005|371930009|386585008|421379005|60022001|386585008
of this rare phenomenon|84638005|103356009
is
a parthenogenetic division|118630004
of a haploid ovum|27159004|263828003
into two haploid ova.|420797005|27159004|263828003

Upon fertilization|55767001
of the two ova|420797005|263828003
by two sperm cells|420797005|6789008
(one|421379005
carrying|288345009
an X
and
the other carrying|74964007|288345009
a Y chromosome|5421003
)
,
the two fertilized ova|420797005|57323001
are
then
fused together
resulting|42752001
in a person|125676002
having
dual genitalial,
gonadal|43174007
and
genetic sex.|3950001|258139002|3950001|365952006|3950001|263495000|3950001|70256003|3950001|57312000|255395001|258139002|255395001|365952006|255395001|263495000|255395001|70256003|255395001|57312000

*
*Hermaphrodite|237821001
*
*
is
used|394850002
in botany to|31006001
describe
a flower|16719004
that
has
both
staminate|406203001
(male,|248153007
pollen-|256259004
producing
)
and
carpellate
(female,|248152002|224526002
ovule-
producing
)
parts.|260726005

This condition|260905004
is
seen
in many common garden plants.|72906007|38313002

A closer analogy|29179001
to hermaphroditism|237821001
in botany|31006001
is
the presence|386397008
of separate male|263869007|248153007
and
female flowers|248152002|16719004|224526002|16719004
on the same individual?|262126009|125676002|262126009|385435006
such plants|31006001
are
called
*
*monoecious
*
*.

Monoecy
is
especially common|72906007
in conifers,|420794003
but
occurs|272120004
in only about 7%|50607009|420295001
of angiosperm species.[13]|420928000|69658003

_Hermaphrodite_|237821001
was
used|394850002
to
describe
any person|125676002
incompatible
with the biological gender|12893009|263495000
binary,
but
has
recently|6493001
been
replaced|282089006|370124000
by _intersex_
in medicine.|410942007

Humans|278412004
with typical reproductive organs|410653004
but
atypical clitoris/penis|112231000|65439009|18911002|112231000|65439009|265793009|112231000|181442003|18911002|112231000|181442003|265793009
are
called
pseudohermaphrodites
in medical literature.|74188005

Pseudohermaphroditism also|75164001
refers|439980006
to a human possessing|278412004
both
the clitoris|65439009|181442003
and
testicles.[14]|279572002

People|125676002
with intersex
conditions|78326006|260905004
sometimes
choose
to
live|419749002
exclusively
as
one sex|421379005|258139002|421379005|365952006|421379005|263495000|421379005|70256003|421379005|57312000
or
the other,|74964007
using|260676000
clothing,|272180002
social cues,
genital surgery,|263767004|83578000
and
hormone replacement therapy to|266717002
blend
into the sex|258139002|365952006|263495000|70256003|57312000
they
identify|7882003
with more closely.|242762006

Some people|125676002
who
are
intersex,
such as some
of those with androgen insensitivity syndrome,|20401003|12313004|20401003|52832001|421463005|12313004|421463005|52832001
outwardly
appear
completely female|248152002|224526002
or
male already,|248153007
without realizing
they
are
intersex.

Other kinds|74964007|261664005
of intersex conditions|260905004
are
identified|7882003
immediately|49499008
at birth|3950001
because
those
with the condition|260905004
have
a sexual organ|365952006|410653004
larger|255509001|263768009
than a clitoris|65439009|181442003
and
smaller|263796003|255507004
than a penis.|18911002|265793009

Intersex
is
thought|88952004
by some to
be
caused|23981006|134198009
by unusual sex hormones|312263009
;
the unusual hormones|87568004
may
be
caused|23981006|134198009
by an atypical set|112231000
of sex chromosomes.|312238009

Sigmund Freud
(
based|418836005
on work|261041009
by his
associate|47429007
Wilhelm Fliess
held|421139008
fetal hermaphroditism to|237821001
be
a fact
of the physiological development|1360005|278923009
of humans._[citation|278412004
needed|410525008|103325001
_]
He
based much|418836005
of his theory
of innate sexuality|365952006|118200004
on
that assumption._[citation
needed|410525008|103325001
_] Similarly,
in contemporary times,|410669006|417929005
fetuses
before sexual differentiation|365952006
are
sometimes
described
as female|248152002|224526002
by doctors|309343006
explaining
the process.|415178003

Neither
concept
is
technically true.|31874001

Before this stage,|21191007|371508000|261612004
humans|278412004
are
simply
undifferentiated|263918006
and
possess
a M?llerian duct,|343011009|91726008
a Wolffian duct,|49222007
and
a genital tubercle.|9770007|308798005

The term "hermaphrodite"|237821001
derives
from Hermaphroditus,
the son|65616008
of Hermes
and
Aphrodite
in Greek mythology.|1451003

According to Ovid,
he
fused
with a nymph,|362240001
Salmacis,
resulting|42752001
in one individual possessing physical traits|421379005|125676002|5880005|421379005|125676002|19388002|421379005|385435006|5880005|421379005|385435006|19388002
of
both
sexes.|258139002|365952006|263495000|70256003|57312000

Although
,
according to Diodorus,
who
mentions
at an earlier period,|264499004|259037005
he
was
born|106970005|81827009|398209006
with a physical body combining|5880005|279495008|89780004|5880005|279495008|20909006|5880005|123037004|89780004|5880005|123037004|20909006|19388002|279495008|89780004|19388002|279495008|20909006|19388002|123037004|89780004|19388002|123037004|20909006
