*Scrapie|35103004
*
*
is
a fatal, degenerative disease|399166001|362975008
that
affects|4065008
the nervous systems|25087005
of sheep|388254009|255392003
and
goats.|125097000|388249000

It
is
one|421379005
of several transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs),|261028005|230284004
which
are
related|272151006|262094002
to bovine spongiform encephalopathy|52869003
(BSE|409979009
or
"mad cow disease"|52869003
)
and
chronic wasting disease|27624003
of deer.|107003000

Like other spongiform encephalopathies,|74964007|230284004
scrapie|35103004
is
caused|23981006|134198009
by a prion.|84676004

Scrapie|35103004
has
been
known|36692007
since
the 18th century
(1732
)
and
does
not
appear
to
be
transmissible
to humans.[3][4]|278412004

The name scrapie|35103004
is
derived
from one|421379005
of the clinical signs|58147004|72670004
of the condition,|260905004
wherein
affected animals|116689002
will
compulsively
scrape|56757003|258431006
off their fleeces
against rocks,
trees|22097005
or
fences.

The disease apparently|64572001
causes|134198009
an itching sensation|424492005|106148006|424492005|271712005|424492005|272144002
in the animals.|387961004

Other clinical signs|74964007|58147004|72670004
include|55919000
excessive lip smacking, altered gaits,|260378005|261114002|387341002|271705001|260378005|181221003|387341002|271705001
and
convulsive collapse.[5]|27942005|16277007|271787007|91175000|27942005|91175000|16277007|91175000|271787007

Scrapie|35103004
is
infectious
and
transmissible
among similar animals,|387961004
so
one|421379005
of the most common ways to|4757001|72906007
contain|42504009
it
(
since
it
is
incurable
)
is
to
quarantine|170499009
and
destroy
those affected.|247591002|248448006

However,
scrapie|35103004
tends
to
persist
in flocks|419668007
and
can
also
arise|68727004
apparently spontaneously
in flocks|419668007
that
have
not previously
had
cases|398241000|413769002
of the disease.|64572001

The mechanism|257544000
of transmission|258150004
between animals|387961004
and
other aspects|74964007
of the biology|12893009
of the disease|64572001
are
only poorly|50607009|556001|420295001|556001
understood|66216009
and
these
are
active areas|55561003|42798000
of research.

Recent studies|6493001|110465008|6493001|224699009
suggest
prions|84676004
may
be
spread|410677005
through urine|78014005
and
persist
in the environment|276339004
for decades.[6]

Scrapie|35103004
usually
affects|4065008
sheep|388254009|255392003
around three to five years|421291004|421820001|258707000
of age.|424144002

There
appears
to
be
the potential|30207005
for transmission|258150004
at birth|3950001
and
from contact|11723008|70862002
with placental tissues.|122736005

There
is
no evidence|18669006
that scrapie|35103004
is
infectious
to humans.[7]|278412004

The protein enters|88878007|417985001
through the intestines|261093006
or
through cuts|283396008
in the skin.|119325001|39937001|181469002

The prions|84676004
cause|23981006|134198009
normal proteins|17621005|88878007|258744000|88878007
of the sheep|388254009|255392003
to fold|26310004
into the wrong shape.|107644003|246176004|300842002

These proteins|88878007
are
gradually
accumulated
in the body,|279495008|123037004
especially
in nerve cells,|47220008
which subsequently
die.|419620001|399069006|419099009

When
the prions|84676004
are
absorbed
through the intestines,|261093006
they first|255216001|232714002
appear
in the lymph nodes,|59441001
especially
in Peyer's
patches|36875001
at the small intestine.[8]|264196002|181250005

An experiment
has
shown
lambs|255392003
risk|30207005
being
infected
through milk|3718001|119321005|70813002
from infected ewes,|10008004
[9]
but
the lambs|255392003
in the experiment also
infected
each other,
making
it difficult to|52925006
assess
the risk|30207005
of infection.

The experiment
did
not
continue|255238004
long enough to|255511005
show
that
the lambs|255392003
developed
symptoms,
but
merely
that
the prion|84676004
was
present|52101004|246105001
in their bodies.|279495008|123037004

Changes|243326001|263703002
are
mild|255604002
at first|255216001|232714002
;
there
may
be
slight behavioural changes|255510006|315244000|255604002|315244000
and
maybe
an increase|260366006
in chewing movements.|1202003|255324009|419747000|255324009

Ataxia|20262006
and
neurological signs then|1199008|72670004
develop
,
and
affected sheep struggle to|247591002|388254009|247591002|255392003|248448006|388254009|248448006|255392003
keep
up
with the flock.[7]|419668007

Some sheep scratch excessively|388254009|53181008|260378005|255392003|53181008|260378005
and
will
show
patches|36875001
of wool loss|412161004
and
lesions
on the skin.|119325001|39937001|181469002

Scratching sheep|40590001|388254009|40590001|255392003|53181008|388254009|53181008|255392003
over the rump area|42798000
may
lead|88488004
to a nibbling reflex|87572000|106146005
which
is
pathognomonic
for the condition.[7]|260905004

Signs|72670004
of a chronic systemic disease|27624003|31099001|90734009|264578000
appear
later,
with weight loss,|89362005
anorexia,
lethargy|214264003
and
possibly death.[7]|60022001|419620001|60022001|268923008

_Post mortem_ examination|168461002
is
important
for the diagnosis|439401001
of scrapie.|35103004

Histology|67151002
of tissues|85756007
will
show
accumulation
of prion|84676004
in the central nervous system,|21483005|278199004
and
immunohistochemical staining|127790008
and
ELISA|76978006
can
also
be
used|394850002
to
demonstrate
the protein.|88878007

No treatment|276239002|416118004
is
available|103328004
for affected sheep.[7]|247591002|388254009|247591002|255392003|248448006|388254009|248448006|255392003

A test|269814003|272393004
now available|103328004
which
is
performed|398166005
by sampling|257915005
a small amount|255507004|107651007
of lymphatic tissue|6969002
from the third eyelid.[10]|113326005

In the United Kingdom,|223860005
the government
has
put
in
place|257557008|421066005
a National Scrapie Plan,|35103004|52713000|35103004|397943006
which encourages
breeding
from sheep|388254009|255392003
that
are
genetically more resistant to|30714006
scrapie.|35103004

This
is
intended to eventually|361269008
reduce|260400001
the incidence
of the disease|64572001
in the UK sheep population.|388254009|385436007|388254009|389109008|255392003|385436007|255392003|389109008

Scrapie|35103004
occurs|272120004
in Europe|223502009
and
North America,|223503004
but
to date,|410671006
Australia|223621005
and
New Zealand|223625001
(
both
major sheep-producing countries|255603008|388254009|223369002|255603008|255392003|223369002
)
are
scrapie-|35103004
free.|37837009

Breeds
such as Cheviot
and
Suffolk|223901006
are
more susceptible to|242762006|131196009
scrapie|35103004
than other breeds.|74964007

Specifically,
this
is
determined
by the genes|67271001
coding
for the naturally
occurring|272120004
prion proteins.|84676004

The most resistant sheep|4757001|30714006|388254009|4757001|30714006|255392003
have
a double set|1305003
of "ARR" alleles,|9109004
while
sheep|388254009|255392003
with the "VRQ" allele|9109004
are
the most susceptible.|4757001|131196009

A simple blood test|13673007|252275004|13673007
reveals|263857004
the allele|9109004
of the sheep,|388254009|255392003
and
many countries|260396001|223369002
are
actively
breeding
away
the VRQ allele.|9109004

Out of fear|1402001
of BSE,|409979009
many European countries|223633000
banned
some traditional sheep|263901007|388254009|263901007|255392003
or
goat products|125097000|388249000
made
without removing|127485006
the spinal cord,|2748008|180959008
such as smalahove
and
smokie.[13]

In 2010,
A team
from New York|420278009
described
detection
of PrPSc even
when
initially|884001
present|52101004|246105001
at only one part|50607009|421379005|260726005|420295001|421379005|260726005
in a hundred thousand million
(10?11
)
in brain tissue.|256865009|280369009

The method|260686004|272394005
combines|20909006
amplification
with a novel technology|7147002
called
Surround Optical Fiber Immunoassay (SOFIA)|355648006|281004000|116272000|414464004|355648006|281004000|400293002|414464004|355648006|281004000|87028007|414464004|355648006|281004000|37202001|414464004
and
some specific antibodies|404263002
against PrPSc.

After amplifying
and
then
concentrating
any PrPSc,
the samples|123038009
are
labelled
with a fluorescent dye|35352008|61789006
using|260676000
an antibody|68498002|112133008
for specificity|69658003
and
then finally
loaded
into a microcapillary tube.|83059008

This tube|83059008
is
placed|257557008|421066005
in a specially constructed apparatus
so
it
is
totally
surrounded|355648006
by optical fibres to|281004000|400293002|281004000|37202001
capture
all light|56242006|371268001
emitted|113067009
once the dye|61789006
is
excited
using|260676000
a laser.|122456005|38586004

The technique|272394005
allowed
detection
of PrPSc
after many fewer cycles|57176003|44180009
of conversion|272148004
than others|74964007
have
achieved
,
substantially
reducing|260400001
the possibility
of artefacts,|47973001
as well as
speeding
up the assay.|58779000|272392009

The researchers also
tested|272393004
their method|260686004|272394005
on blood samples|119297000
from apparently healthy sheep|263775005|388254009|263775005|255392003
that
went
on to
develop
scrapie.|35103004

The animals? brains|387961004|12738006
were
analysed
once any symptoms
became
apparent.

The researchers
could
therefore
compare
results|394617004
from brain tissue|256865009|280369009
and
blood|87612001|119273009
taken|419652001
once the animals|387961004
exhibited
symptoms
of the diseases,|64572001
with blood|87612001|119273009
obtained|398092000
earlier|264499004
in the animals? lives,|387961004|224130005
and
from uninfected animals.|387961004

The results|394617004
showed
very clearly|260358002
that PrPSc
could
be
detected|260373001
in the blood|87612001|119273009
of animals|387961004
long|255511005
before the symptoms
appeared.

After further development|46053002|278923009
and
testing,|272393004
this method|260686004|272394005
could
be
of great value|255509001|263768009
in surveillance|225419007
as a blood-|87612001|119273009
or
urine-based screening test|167217005|20135006|167217005|418836005|20135006|269814003|272393004|418836005|269814003|418836005|418836005|272393004|171245007|269814003|171245007|171245007|272393004|171245007|418836005|269814003|171245007|418836005|171245007|418836005|272393004
for scrapie.[14][15]|35103004

Various studies|256220008|110465008|256220008|224699009
have
indicated prions|410535002|84676004
(PrPSC
)
that
infect
sheep|388254009|255392003
and
goats|125097000|388249000
with the fatal transmissible encephalopathy|399166001
known|36692007
as scrapie,|35103004
are
able to|371150009
persist
in soil|415555003
for years|258707000
without losing
their pathogenic activity.|264418008|48761009|264418008|55561003|264418008|258745004|264418008|257733005

Dissemination|65709003
of prions|84676004
into the environment|276339004
can
occur|272120004
from several sources|261028005|260753009
:
mainly,
infectious placenta|62669004|181455002
or
amniotic fluid|77012006
of sheep|388254009|255392003
and
possibly environmental contamination|60022001|102411008
by saliva|256897009
or
excrement.

Confirmatory tesing
for scrapie|35103004
can
only
be
achieved
by applying immunohistochemistry (IHC)|410618006|117617002|417924000|117617002
of disease-associated prion protein|230284004|47429007|88878007|64572001|47429007|84676004
(PrPSc
)
to tissues|85756007
collected
_post mortem_,|168461002
including|55919000
obex,
retropharyngeal lymph node|25683005|167263004
and
palatine tonsil.|75573002|265787001

A live animal|419749002|387961004
diagnostic,|439401001|261004008
not confirmatory, test|269814003|272393004
was
approved|9571008
in 2008
for immunochemistry testing|272393004
on rectal biopsy-derived lymphoid tissue|54686006|6969002
by USDA.

Natural transmission|510009|258150004
of scrapie|35103004
in the field|52101004|255798002|18720000|255798002
seems
to
occur|272120004
via the alimentary tract|122865005
in the majority
of cases,|398241000|413769002
and
scrapie-free sheep flocks|35103004|37837009|388254009|419668007|35103004|37837009|255392003|419668007
can
become
infected
on pastures
where outbreaks|443684005
of scrapie|35103004
had
been
observed
before.|236874000|421718005

These findings|404684003
point
to a sustained contagion|263892007
in the environment,|276339004
and
notably
the soil.[17]|415555003

Prion concentration|84676004|82742001
in birth fluids|3950001|32457005|3950001|33463005
does
not
alter
the infectivity

Even
when
placentas|62669004

at the USDA Agricultural Research Service.[18]|224930009

Fecal concentration|39477002|82742001
of PrPSC
has
been
reported|229059009|223458004
in the feces|39477002
of sheep|388254009|255392003
both
in the terminal|42796001
and
the early preclinical stages|264499004|261612004
of the disease,|64572001
suggesting
the prions|84676004
are
likely to|2931005
be
shed
into the environment|276339004
throughout the pathogenesis.|303109001

Several sources|261028005|260753009
of prions|84676004
in feces|39477002
could
be
postulated
,
including|55919000
environmental ingestion|276339004|111984006
and
swallowing infected saliva|54731003|256897009|288937009|256897009
;
however,
the most likely source|4757001|2931005|260753009
is
shedding
from the gut-associated lymphoid tissue.|122865005|47429007|6969002

Ruminants
have
specialized Peyer's|67995009
patches|36875001
that
throughout the length|410668003
of the ileum|34516001|181249005
amount|107651007
to approximately 100,000 follicles,|26175008|24162005|26175008|67290009
and
all
of these
could
be
infected
and
shedding prions|84676004
into the lumen.|113342003|342806003|398252006

Scrapie prions|35103004|84676004
have
been
found|404684003
in the Peyer's
patches|36875001
of naturally
infected
nonclinical lambs|255392003
as young|84422007
as four months|421534005|258706009
of age.|424144002

Ingestion|111984006
of soil|415555003
by grazing sheep|262536007|388254009|262536007|255392003
has
been
measured|258104002
in two soil types,|420797005|415555003|261664005
at two stocking rates|420797005|228184002
and
over two grazing seasons.|21481007|420797005|262536007|21864008

Animals|387961004
ingested|111984006
up to 44g soil|415555003
per kg|223574006|258683005
of body weight|27113001|39857003
between May
and
November.

Rainfall
and
stocking rate|228184002
emerged
as factors
influencing
ingestion.|111984006

The effect|253861007
of soil type|415555003|261664005
and
herbage
on
offer|410527000
was
less evident.[20]|276139006|18669006|263796003|18669006

The average weight|27113001|272102008|39857003
of an adult sheep|133936004|388254009|133936004|255392003
is
approximately 250 pounds.|26175008|258693003

If
an adult sheep ate 400g/kg|133936004|388254009|48263008|223574006|133936004|388254009|48263008|258683005|133936004|255392003|48263008|223574006|133936004|255392003|48263008|258683005
of soil|415555003
as
predicted
by D.|876000

McGrath _
et
al._,
then
the average sheep|388254009|255392003
would
ingest|111984006
approximately 45,000 g|26175008|258795003
over six months,|422218008|258706009
or
251 g|258795003
per day.|258703001|259032004

Assuming
the soil|415555003
was
contaminated|62604006
with prions|84676004
(PrPSC
)
from feces|39477002
or
birth fluids,|3950001|32457005|3950001|33463005
then potentially
the sheep|388254009|255392003
would
be
infected.

The concentration|82742001
of the prions|84676004
is
uncertain,|64957009
and
concentration|82742001
is
not directly proportional|8212001
to infectivity.

Factors
affecting|247591002|248448006
prion infectivity|84676004
in the soil|415555003
have
been
shown
to
include|55919000
the length|410668003
of time|410669006
in the soil|415555003
and
the binding abilities|257768005|371150009
of the soil.|415555003

For a detailed risk assessment|225338004
of scrapie-contaminated soil,|35103004|102417007
it
was
of major importance to|255603008
analyze
whether
the detectable PrPSc
in the soil|415555003
extracts|62972009
still
exhibited oral infectivity|275393007
after incubation times|410669006|417929005
up to 29 months.|258706009

A bioassay|58779000
with Syrian hamsters|392389001
was
performed|398166005
by feeding|129007004
the animals|387961004
with contaminated soil|102417007
or
aqueous soil|415555003
extracts|62972009
that
had
been
collected
after soil incubation|415555003
for 26
and
29 months,|258706009
respectively.

Hamsters|392390005
fed|238092004
with contaminated soil|102417007
exhibited
first scrapie-associated symptoms at 2 weeks|255216001|35103004|102483000|258705008|232714002|35103004|102483000|258705008
to 6 months|258706009
(95% CI
)
after the first application.|255216001|410618006|232714002|410618006

The hamsters|392390005
reached|282679008
the terminal stage|42796001
of scrapie|35103004
at 5|264706000|264605009
to 21 months|258706009
(95% CI
)
after the first feeding.|255216001|129007004|232714002|129007004

This indicated substantial amounts|410535002|107651007
of persistent infectivity|115648009
in soil|415555003
that
had
been
incubated
for 26
and
29 months.|258706009

In Iceland|223667005
in 1978,
a program
was
implemented
to
eradicate
scrapie,|35103004
and
affected flocks|247591002|419668007|248448006|419668007
were
culled
,
premises
were
disinfected
,
sheep houses|388254009|261770009|255392003|261770009
were
burnt|125666000
;
after two|420797005
to three years,|421291004|258707000
the premises
were
restocked
with lambs|255392003
from scrapie-free areas.|35103004|37837009|42798000

Between 1978
and
2004,
scrapie|35103004
recurred|246455001
on 33 farms.|264667004|224816003

Nine recurrences|422113007|246455001
occurred|272120004
14?21 years|258707000
after culling
as a result|394617004
of environmental contamination.[23]|102411008|264657009

The binding abilities|257768005|371150009
of different soil types|263735002|415555003|261664005
have
been
shown
to
enhance
disease penetrance.|64572001|53568006

Soil|415555003
containing|42504009
the common clay mineral montmorillonite (Mte)|72906007|87918000
and
kaolinite (Kte)
binds|257768005
more effectively|242762006
with the prions|84676004
than soil containing quartz.|415555003|42504009|64827004

Enhanced transmissibility
of soil-bound prions|415555003|75958009|84676004|415555003|257768005|84676004|415555003|418131003|84676004
may
explain
the environmental|276339004
spread|410677005
of scrapie|35103004
despite low levels|62482003|258395000|371880002|258395000
shed
into the environment.|276339004

The mechanism|257544000
by which Mte
or
other soil components|74964007|415555003|246093002
enhances
the transmissibility
of particle bound prions|75958009|84676004|257768005|84676004|418131003|84676004
remains
to
be
clarified.

Prion binding|84676004|257768005
to Mte
or
other soil components|74964007|415555003|246093002
may
partially
protect
PrPSC
from denaturation|40241000
or
proteolysis
in the digestive tract,|122865005
allowing
more disease agent to|242762006|64572001|260872001
be
taken|419652001
up
from the gut.|122865005

Adsorption
of PrPSc soil|415555003
may
alter
aggregation state|47286004|398070004|258746003|398070004
of the protein,|88878007
shifting|9546005
the size distribution|277049003|255464007
toward more infectious prion protein particles,|242762006|84676004
thereby
increasing|260369004
the infectious units.|258666001

For prion disease to|230284004
be
transmitted|60117003|258150004
via ingestion|111984006
of prion contaminated soil,|84676004|102417007
prions|84676004
must
also
remain
infectious
by the oral route|26643006
of exposure.|71677004|24932003

Researchers
at the University of Wisconsin|224871002|427726005
investigated|116698004
the oral infectivity|275393007
of Mte
and
soil-bound prions.|415555003|75958009|84676004|415555003|257768005|84676004|415555003|418131003|84676004

The effects|253861007
of prion source|84676004|260753009
(
via infected brain homogenate|12738006|258335003
and
purified PrPSc
)
and
dose|277406006|408102007
on penetrance|53568006
(proportion|8212001
of animals eventually|387961004
exhibiting
clinical signs|58147004|72670004
of scrapie|35103004
)
and
incubation period|406646006
(time|410669006
to onset|77374008
of clinical symptoms|58147004
)
was
evaluated.

Approximately 38%|26175008|264670000
of animals|387961004
receiving
200 ng
of unbound, clarified PrPSc orally|260548002
exhibited
clinical symptoms,|58147004
with an incubation period|406646006
for infected animals|387961004
of 203
to 633 days.|258703001

In contrast,
all animals orally|387961004|260548002
dosed|277406006|408102007
with an equivalent amount|9726003|107651007|258726008|107651007
of Mte-bound PrPSc|75958009|257768005|418131003
manifested|250255003|249319006
disease symptoms|64572001
in 195
to 637 days.|258703001

Animals orally|387961004|260548002
receiving
Mte soil|415555003
alone|105529008
or
on-tenth|28226006
as much unbound clarified PrPSc
(20 ng
)
remained
asymptomatic|84387000
throughout the course|288524001
of the experiment.

These data
established|263748003|385645004
that Mte-bound prions|75958009|84676004|257768005|84676004|418131003|84676004
remain
infectious
via the oral route|26643006
of exposure,|71677004|24932003
but
that
the agent binding Mte|260872001|257768005
increases|260366006
disease penetrance,|64572001|53568006
enhancing
the efficiency|260375008
of oral transmission.[25]|260548002|258150004

Prions|84676004
(PrPSc
)
are
shed
from sheep|388254009|255392003
and
goats|125097000|388249000
in birth fluids,|3950001|32457005|3950001|33463005
feces|39477002
and
other excrement.|74964007

The concentration|82742001
of the prions|84676004
is
uncertain,|64957009
but
is
not directly proportional|8212001
to infectivity.

Sheep|388254009|255392003
ingest|111984006
soil,|415555003
so
soil|415555003
represents
a plausible environmental reservoir|276339004|257687008
of scrapie,|35103004
which
can
persist
in the environment|276339004
for years.|258707000

Longevity|111951006
of the prions|84676004
and
the attachment|1431002
of soil particles likely|415555003|2931005

infectivity
of prions|84676004
in the environment.|276339004

Effective methods to|255403003|260686004|255403003|272394005|254648000|260686004|254648000|272394005
inactivate
prions|84676004
in the soil|415555003
are
currently lacking,|15240007|41277001
and
the effects|253861007
of natural degradation mechanisms|510009|40091007|257544000
on prion infectivity|84676004
are
largely
unknown.|261665006

An improved understanding|385425000|66216009|3442003|66216009
of the processes|415178003
affecting|247591002|248448006
the mobility,|363803005|246197003
persistence|130965009
and
bioavailability|115470003
of prions|84676004
in soil|415555003
is
needed|410525008|103325001
for the management|413454004|119270007
of prion-contaminated environments.|84676004|62604006|276339004

A system|246333005
for estimating|414135002
the prion-binding capacity|84676004|258732003
of soil|415555003
on farms|224816003
using|260676000
simple soil analysis|13673007|415555003|272389005
may
allow
an estimate|414135002
of the prion risk|84676004|30207005
in the environment,|276339004
and
whether prion binding|84676004|257768005
by the use|277889008|419385000
of soil amendments|415555003
or
top dressings|421812003|333453004
may
help
to
mitigate|6736007
the infectious prions.|84676004

Lichens,|82113000
_Lobaria pulmonaria_,
may
have
potential|30207005
for reducing|260400001
the number|410680006|410681005
of prions|84676004
because
some species|69658003
contain|42504009
proteases|130202003|116536008
