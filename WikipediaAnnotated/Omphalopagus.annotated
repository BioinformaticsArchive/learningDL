*Conjoined twins|41337007
*
*
are
identical twins[1]|313415001
whose bodies|279495008|123037004
are
joined
in utero.|35039007

A rare phenomenon,|84638005|103356009
the occurrence|272120004
is
estimated|414135002
to range
from 1|260305007
in 50,000 births|3950001
to 1|260305007
in 100,000 births,|3950001
with a somewhat higher incidence|75540009|371879000
in Southwest Asia|223500001
and
Africa.|223498002

Approximately half|26175008
are
stillborn
,
and
a smaller fraction|263796003|278277004|255507004|278277004
of pairs
born|106970005|81827009|398209006
alive|438949009
have
abnormalities|276654001
incompatible
with life.|224130005

The overall survival rate
for conjoined twins|41337007
is
approximately 25%.|26175008

The condition|260905004
is
more frequently|242762006|70232002
found|404684003
among females,|248152002
with a ratio|118586006
of 3|260313008
:
1.[2]|303183002

Two contradicting theories|420797005
exist
to
explain
the origins|255395001
of conjoined twins.|41337007

The older theory|70753007
is
_fission_,
in which
the fertilized egg|57323001
splits|410714001
partially.

The second|81170007|257997001|288495006
and
more generally accepted theory|242762006|385645004
is
fusion,|31883006|122501008
in which
a fertilized egg completely|57323001
separates|13184001|263869007
,
but
stem cells|419758009
(
which
search
for similar cells|4421005
)
find
like-stem cells|419758009
on the other twin|74964007|11286003|74964007|1305003
and
fuse
the twins together.|11286003

Conjoined twins|41337007
share
a single common chorion,|125681006|72906007|74439004|50607009|72906007|74439004
placenta,|62669004|181455002
and
amniotic sac,|70847004|181457005
although
these characteristics
are
not exclusive
to conjoined twins|41337007
as
there
are
some monozygotic
but
non-conjoined twins|41337007
that also
share
these structures
in utero.[4]|35039007

The most famous pair|4757001
of conjoined twins|41337007
was
Chang
and
Eng Bunker
(Thai|83365001
: ???-???,
In-Chan
)
(1811?1874
)
,
Thai brothers|83365001|70924004
born|106970005|81827009|398209006
in Siam,
now Thailand.|223594002

They
traveled|420008001
with [P.T.|20304007

Barnum]
(/wiki/P.T._Barnum
)
's
circus|285083000|396826001
for many years|258707000
and
were
billed|27883009
as the
*
*Siamese Twins|41337007
*
*.

Chang
and
Eng
were
joined
by a band|51878007
of flesh,
cartilage,|61496007
and
their fused livers|10200004
at the torso.|22943007

In modern times,|410669006|417929005
they
could
have
been
easily|36203004
separated.|13184001|263869007

Due to the brothers' fame|70924004
and
the rarity|84638005|103356009
of the condition,|260905004
the term "Siamese twins"|41337007
came
to
be
used|394850002
as a synonym
for conjoined twins.[6]|41337007

Conjoined twins|41337007
are
typically
classified|73504009
by the point
at which
their bodies|279495008|123037004
are
joined.

The most common types|4757001|72906007|261664005
of conjoined twins|41337007
are
:

Other less-common types|74964007|72906007|261664005
of conjoined twins|41337007
include|55919000
:

Surgery to|83578000
separate|263869007
conjoined twins|41337007
may
range
from relatively simple to extremely complex,|13673007|103360007
depending
on the point
of attachment|1431002
and
the internal parts|260521003|260726005
that
are
shared.

Most cases|398241000|413769002
of separation|16640008|160788005
are
extremely risky|30207005
and
life-threatening.|224130005

In many cases,|398241000|413769002
the surgery|83578000
results|394617004
in the death|419620001|268923008
of one|421379005
or
both
of the twins,|11286003
particularly
if
they
are
joined
at the head.|69536005|302548004

This
makes
the ethics
of surgical separation,|83578000|16640008|83578000|160788005
where
the twins|11286003
can
survive
if
not
separated|13184001|263869007
,
contentious.

Dreger
found|404684003
the quality|263496004
of life|224130005
of twins|11286003
who
remain
conjoined
to
be
higher|75540009|371879000
than
is
commonly
supposed.

Lori|34019001|389047001
and
George Schappell
are
a good example.|20572008

Recent successful separations|6493001|385669000|160788005
of conjoined twins|41337007
include|55919000
that
of the separation|16640008|160788005
of Ganga & Jamuna Shreshta
in 2001,
who
were
born|106970005|81827009|398209006
in Kathmandu,
Nepal|223602002
in 2000.

The 97-hour surgery|260309001|258702006|83578000|260309001|286551008|83578000|264708004|258702006|83578000|264708004|286551008|83578000
on the pair
of craniopagus twins|74516008|11286003
was
a landmark one|421379005
which
took|419652001
place|257557008|421066005
in Singapore|223593008
;
the team
was
led|88488004|236874000
by neurosurgeons,|45544007

and

Keith Goh.

Ganga Shrestha
died|419620001|419099009
at the Model Hospital|285201006
in Katmandu
in July 2009,
at the age|424144002
of 8,
three days|421291004|258703001
after
being
admitted|32485007
for treatment|276239002|416118004
of a severe chest infection.|24484000|50417007|24484000|195742007

Notable also
is
the success|385669000
of Dr.|309343006

Ben Carson.

In 1987,
Carson
made
medical history|392521001
by
being
the first surgeon|255216001|304292004|232714002|304292004
in the world
to successfully
separate|263869007
siamese twins|41337007
(
the Binder twins|40519001|11286003
)
conjoined
at the back of the head|43631005|182322006
(craniopagus twins|74516008|11286003
).

Operations to|83578000
separate|263869007
twins|11286003
joined
in this way
had
always
failed
,
resulting|42752001
in the death|419620001|268923008
of one|421379005
or
both
of the infants.|418119000

Carson
agreed
to
undertake
the operation.|83578000

The 50-member surgical team,|394852005|83578000
led|88488004|236874000
by Carson,
worked|261041009
for 22 hours.|258702006

At the end,|261782000|422117008
the twins|11286003
were
successfully
separated|13184001|263869007
and
can
now
survive
independently.

Carson recalls
:

In 2003 two women|420797005|224526002
from Iran,|223607008
Ladan
and
Laleh Bijani,
who
were
joined
at the head|69536005|302548004
but
had
separate brains|263869007|12738006
(craniopagus|74516008
)
were
surgically|83578000
separated|13184001|263869007
in Singapore,|223593008
despite
surgeons' warnings|304292004
that
the operation|83578000
could
be
fatal|399166001
to one|421379005
or
both.

Both
women|224526002
died|419620001|419099009
during surgery|83578000
on July 8,
2003.

A case|398241000
of particular interest|225469004
was
that
of infants|418119000
Rose
and
Gracie
("Mary"
and
"Jodie"
)
Attard,
conjoined twins|41337007
from Malta|223670009
who
were
separated|13184001|263869007
by court order
in Great Britain|223861009
over the religious objections|62458008
of their parents,|40683002
Michaelangelo
and
Rina Attard.

The surgery|83578000
took|419652001
place|257557008|421066005
in November,
2000,
at St Mary's Hospital|223914007|223914007|285201006
in Manchester.

The operation|83578000
was
controversial
because
Rose,
the weaker twin,|13791008|11286003|13791008|1305003|260407003|11286003|260407003|1305003
would
die|419620001|399069006|419099009
as a result|394617004
of the procedure|71388002
as her heart|80891009|302509004
and
lungs|39607008
were
dependent|371154000
upon Gracie's.

(
The twins|11286003
were
attached|102491009
at the lower abdomen|27033000
and
spine.|421060004|44300000|243930007
)
However,
if
the operation|83578000
had
not
taken|419652001
place|257557008|421066005
,
it
was
certain|17162000
that
both
twins|11286003
would
die.[14][15]|419620001|399069006|419099009

The Moche culture|252398009|61594008
of ancient Peru|223721003
depicted
conjoined twins|41337007
in their ceramics|261253002
dating|410671006
back
to 300 CE.

Writing|12261009

[St.

The earliest known documented case|264499004|36692007|397934002|398241000
of conjoined twins|41337007
dates|410671006
from the year 942,|258707000|259039008
when
a pair
of conjoined twin brothers|41337007|70924004
from Armenia|223645009
were
brought|68369002
to Constantinople
for medical evaluation.|74188005|74188005|386053000

In Arabia,
the twin brothers Hashim ibn Abd Manaf|81276006|277112006|81276006|258343008
and
'Abd Shams|277112006|258343008
were
born|106970005|81827009|398209006
with Hashim's leg|61685007|30021000|182281004|362793004
attached|102491009
to his twin brother's head.|81276006|69536005|81276006|302548004

Legend says|66049007
that
their father,|66839005
Abd Manaf ibn Qusai,|277112006|258343008
separated|13184001|263869007
his conjoined sons|65616008
with a sword|102328007
and
that
some
priests|79918004
believed
that
the blood|87612001|119273009
that
had
flowed
between them
signified
wars
between their progeny|160499008
(confrontations
did
occur|272120004
between Banu al'Abbas
and
Banu Ummaya ibn 'Abd Shams|277112006|258343008
in the year 750 AH|258707000|259039008
).

The Muslim polymath Ab? al-Rayh?n al-B?r?n? described Siamese twins|271390004|24028007|41337007|309884000|24028007|41337007
in his book _Kitab-al-Saidana_.[19]|278212002

The English twin sisters Mary|297487008|19343003|25804004|19343003
and
Eliza Chulkhurst,
who
were
conjoined
at the back|123961009|255551008|281213008|302552004|77568009
(pygopagus|70642007

,
lived|224130005|419749002
from 1100
to 1134
(
or
1500
to 1534
)
and
were
perhaps
the best-known early historical example|20572008|36692007|264499004|20572008|36692007|264499004|392521001|3442003|36692007|264499004|3442003|36692007|264499004|392521001
of conjoined twins.|41337007

Other early conjoined twins to|74964007|264499004|41337007
attain
notice
were
the "Scottish
brothers|70924004
",
allegedly
of the dicephalus type,|38439000|261664005
essentially two heads|420797005|69536005
sharing
the same body|262126009|279495008|262126009|123037004
(1460?1488,
although
the dates|410671006
vary
)
;
the pygopagus Helen|70642007
and
Judith
of Sz?ny,|91175000|420278009|223550008|420278009
Hungary|223638009
(1701?1723
)
,
who
enjoyed|112080002
a brief career|359530003|359535008
in music
before
being
sent to
live|419749002
in a convent|285115002
;
and
Rita
and
Cristina
of Parodi
of Sardinia,|223839004
born|106970005|81827009|398209006
in 1829.

Rita
and
Cristina
were
dicephalus tetrabrachius|38439000
(one body|421379005|279495008|421379005|123037004

twins|11286003
and
although
they
died|419620001|419099009
at only eight months|50607009|421825006|258706009|420295001|421825006|258706009
of age,|424144002
they
gained|35105006|255396000|260366006|260369004|398092000
much attention|6769007
as a curiosity
when
their parents|40683002
exhibited
them
in Paris.|7074004

Several sets|261028005
of conjoined twins|41337007
lived|224130005|419749002
during the nineteenth century
and
made careers
for themselves
in the performing arts,
though
none|260413007
achieved
quite
the same level|262126009|258395000|262126009|276625007
of fame
and
fortune
as Chang
and
Eng.

Most notably,|4757001
Millie
and
Christine McCoy
(
or
McKoy
)
,
pygopagus twins,|70642007|11286003
were
born|106970005|81827009|398209006
into slavery
in North Carolina|421088005
in 1851.

They
were
sold
to a showman,
J.P.

Smith,|308323009
at birth,|3950001
but
were
soon
kidnapped
by a rival showman.

The kidnapper|105564004
fled
to England|223664003
but
was
thwarted
because England|223664003
had
already
banned
slavery.

Smith|308323009
traveled|420008001
to England to|223664003
collect
the girls|431549007
and
brought|68369002
with him
their mother,|72705000
Monimia,
from whom
they
had
been
separated.|13184001|263869007

He
and
his wife|127850001
provided
the twins|11286003
with an education|266981003|409073007
and
taught|264939006
them to

Those Extraordinary
Twins|11286003
"
as
fictitious twins Angelo|11286003
and
Luigi.

The Toccis,
born|106970005|81827009|398209006
in 1877,
were
dicephalus tetrabrachius twins,|38439000|11286003
having
one body|421379005|279495008|421379005|123037004
with two legs,|420797005|30021000
two heads,|420797005|69536005
and
four arms.|421534005|40983000

From birth|3950001
they
were
forced|263760002
by their parents to|40683002
perform|398166005
and
never
learned|69998004
to
walk|129006008
,
as
each twin|11286003|1305003
controlled one leg|31509003|421379005|61685007|31509003|421379005|30021000|31509003|421379005|182281004|31509003|421379005|362793004
(
in modern
times physical therapy|91251008
allows
twins|11286003
like the Toccis to
learn|69998004
to
walk|129006008
on their own
).

They
are
said|66049007

after
touring
the United States,|223688001
the twins|11286003

with their family,|35359004
where
they
fell|1912002

though
