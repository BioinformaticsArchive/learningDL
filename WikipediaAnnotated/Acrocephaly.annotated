*Apert syndrome|205258009
*
*
is
a form|246176004
of acrocephalosyndactyly,|205258009|268262006
a congenital disorder|66091009
characterized
by malformations|276654001
of the skull,|89546000
face,|89545001|302549007
hands|85562004
and
feet.|56459004|259051005

It
is
classified|73504009
as a branchial arch syndrome,|77128003
affecting|247591002|248448006
the first branchial|255216001|232714002
(
or
pharyngeal) arch,|68959004
the precursor
of the maxilla|70925003|181813003
and
mandible.|91609006|181812008

Disturbances
in the development|278923009
of the branchial arches|68959004
in fetal development|278923009
create
lasting
and
widespread effects.|85333001|253861007

In 1906,
Eug?ne Apert,
a French physician,|19434008|309343006
described nine people|422113007|125676002
sharing
similar attributes|246061005
and
characteristics.

Linguistically,
"acro"
is
Greek|1451003
for "peak",|255587001
referring|439980006
to the "
peaked|255587001
" head|69536005|302548004
that
is
common|72906007
in the syndrome.

"Cephalo",
also
from Greek,|1451003
is
a combining form meaning "head".|89780004|246176004|69536005|89780004|246176004|302548004|20909006|246176004|69536005|20909006|246176004|302548004

"Syndactyly" refers|373413006|439980006
to webbing|76640006
of fingers|7569003|259052003
and
toes.|29707007

In embryology,
the hands|85562004
and
feet|56459004|259051005
have
selective cells|4421005
that
die|419620001|399069006|419099009
,
called
selective cell death|4421005|419620001|4421005|268923008|362837007|419620001|362837007|268923008
or
apoptosis,|20663007
causing|23981006
separation|16640008|160788005
of the digits.|82680008

In the case|398241000
of acrocephalosyndactyly,|205258009|268262006
selective cell death|4421005|419620001|4421005|268923008|362837007|419620001|362837007|268923008
does
not
occur|272120004
and
skin,|119325001|39937001|181469002
and
rarely bone,|103356009|272673000|103356009|3138006|103356009|90780006|103356009|128530007
between the fingers|7569003|259052003
and
toes|29707007
fuses.

The cranial bones|181792001
are
affected|247591002|248448006
as well, similar|20572008
to Crouzon syndrome|28861008
and
Pfeiffer syndrome.|70410008

Craniosynostosis|57219006
occurs|272120004
when
the fetal skull|89546000
and
facial bones|91397008
fuse
too soon _
in utero_,|35039007
disrupting
normal bone growth.|58236001|272673000|58236001|3138006|58236001|90780006|58236001|128530007

Fusion|31883006|122501008
of different sutures|263735002|408099007|263735002|360765007
leads|88488004|236874000
to different patterns|263735002|272135003
of growth
on the skull.|89546000

Examples
include|55919000
:
trigonocephaly|28740008
(fusion|31883006|122501008
of the metopic suture,|74448009
brachycephaly|13649004
(fusion|31883006|122501008
of the coronal suture,|29012004|244510008
dolichocephaly|72239002
(fusion|31883006|122501008
of the sagittal suture,|62169003|244511007
plagiocephaly|21850008
(fusion|31883006|122501008
of coronal|81654009
and
lambdoidal sutures unilaterally|408099007|360765007
)
,
and
oxycephaly|48069004
or
turricephaly|48069004
(fusion|31883006|122501008
of coronal|81654009
and
lambdoid sutures|32170006
).

Findings|404684003
for the incidence
of the syndrome
in the population|385436007|389109008
have
varied
,
[2]|260306008
with estimates|414135002
as low|62482003|371880002
as 1 birth|260305007|3950001
in 200,000
provided
[3]|260313008
and
160,000
given|419582001
as an average
by older studies.|70753007|110465008|70753007|224699009

A study|110465008|224699009
conducted|844005
in 1997,
however,
by the California Birth Defects|224043007|276654001|25997004|276654001
Monitoring|302805002
Program,
found|404684003
an incidence rate
of 1
in 80,645
out of almost 2.5 million live births.|281050002

Another study|110465008|224699009
conducted|844005
in 2002
by the Craniofacial Center,|26216008
North Texas Hospital|421662006|421662006|285201006
For Children|410601007|160499008
found|404684003
a higher incidence|75540009|371879000
of about 1
in 65,000 live births.[2]|264695004

The cranial malformations|89546000|276654001|66787007|276654001
are
the most apparent effects|4757001|253861007
of acrocephalosyndactyly.|205258009|268262006

Craniosynostosis|57219006
occurs|272120004
,
with brachiocephaly
being
the common pattern|72906007|272135003
of growth.

Another common characteristic|72906007
is
a high, prominent forehead|75540009|4657009|52795006|371879000|4657009|52795006
with a flat posterior skull.|6041008|255551008|89546000|257564005|255551008|89546000

Due to the premature closing|1090009|29179001
of the coronal sutures,|29012004
increased|35105006|260366006
cranial pressure|89546000|279046003|89546000|13543005|89546000|257893003|66787007|279046003|66787007|13543005|66787007|257893003
can
develop
,
leading|236874000
to mental deficiency.|260372006|248325000

A flat|6041008|257564005
or
concave face|89545001|302549007
may
develop
as a result|394617004
of deficient growth|260372006|418446003
in the mid-facial bones,|255562008|91397008
leading|236874000
to a conditir prognathism.|72855002

Other features|74964007
of acrocephalosyndactyly|205258009|268262006
may
include|55919000
shallow bony orbits|110528008
and
broadly spaced eyes.|81745001

Low-set ears|95515009
are
also
a typical characteristic
of branchial arch syndromes.|77128003

All acrocephalosyndactyly syndromes|205258009|268262006
show
some level|258395000|276625007
of limb anomalies|66019005|243996003
so
it
can
be
hard to tell|72505002
them apart.

However,
the typical hand deformities|299033004
in patients|116154003
with Apert Syndrome|205258009
distinguish
it
from the other syndromes.|74964007

The hands|85562004
in patients|116154003
with Apert syndrome always|205258009
show
four common features [8]|421534005|72906007
:

The deformity|276654001|127560004|417893002
of the space
between the index finger|83738005
and
the thumb|76505004|302540006
may
be
variable.|255372005

Based|418836005
on this first webspace,|255216001|232714002
we
can
differentiate|263933003
three different types|421291004|263735002|261664005
of handdeformation
:

Acrocephalosyndactyly|205258009|268262006
may
be
an autosomal dominant disorder.|263681008|64572001

Males|248153007
and
females|248152002
are
affected|247591002|248448006
equally
;
however
research
is
yet to
determine
an exact cause.|134198009

Nonetheless,
almost all cases|398241000|413769002
are
sporadic,|75741005
signifying
fresh mutations|261013005|55446002
or
environmental insult|276339004
to the genome.|18470003

The offspring|160499008
of a parent|40683002
with Apert syndrome|205258009
has
a 50% chance
of inheriting|255404009
the condition.|260905004

In 1995,
A.O.M.|257971007

Wilkie
published
a paper|50833004
showing
evidence|18669006
that acrocephalosyndactyly|205258009|268262006
is
caused|23981006|134198009
by a defect|6920004
on the fibroblast growth factor receptor 2 gene,|88919005|116647005|67271001
on chromosome 10.[9]|13526007

Apert syndrome|205258009
is
an autosomal dominant disorder|263681008|64572001
;
approximately two-thirds|26175008|420797005|70905002
of the cases|398241000|413769002
are
due to a C
to G mutation|258795003|55446002
at the position 755|246449006
in the FGFR2 gene,|67271001
which
causes|134198009
a Ser
to Trp change|243326001|263703002
in the protein.|88878007

This
is
a male-specific mutation hotspot|248153007|69658003|55446002|68503004
:
in a study|110465008|224699009
of 57 cases,|398241000|413769002
the mutation always|55446002
occurred|272120004
on the paternally derived allele.|9109004

On the basis|418836005
of the observed birth prevalence|3950001
of the disease|64572001
(1
in 70,000
)
,
the apparent rate
of C
to G mutations|258795003|55446002
at this site|10546003
is
about .00005,
which
is
200
to 800 fold|26310004
higher|75540009|371879000
than the usual rate
for mutations|55446002
at CG dinucleotides.

Moreover,
the incidence
rises
sharply
with the age|424144002
of the father.|66839005

Goriely
et
al.

(2003
)
analyzed
the allelic distribution|255464007
of mutations|55446002
in sperm samples|6789008|123038009
from men|339947000
of different ages|263735002|424144002
and
concluded
that
the simplest explanation|13673007
for the data
is
that
the C
to G mutation|258795003|55446002
gives|419582001
the cell|4421005|362837007
an advantage
in the male germline.[10]|248153007

It
is
still
not very|260358002
clear|263707001
why people|125676002
with Apert Syndrome|205258009
both
have
craniosynostosis|57219006
and
syndactyly.|373413006

There
has
been
one|421379005
study|110465008|224699009
that
suggests
it
has
something to do
with the expression|10012005
of three isoforms|421291004
of FGFR2,
the gene|67271001
with the point mutations|55446002
that
causes|134198009
the syndrome
in 98%
of the patients.|116154003

KFGR,
keratinocyte growth factor receptor,|417539006|116647005
is
an isoform
active|55561003
in the metaphysis|33251002
and
interphalangeal joints.|416599001

FGFR1
is
an isoform
active|55561003
in the diaphysis.|53394001

FGFR2-Bek
is
active|55561003
in the metaphysis,|33251002
as well as
the diaphysis|53394001
but
also
in the interdigital mesenchyme.|264041005

The point mutation|55446002
increases|260366006
the ligand-dependent activation|371154000
of FGFR2,
and
thus
of its isoforms.

This means|255586005
that FGFR2
loses
its specificity,|69658003
causing|23981006
binding|257768005
of FGF's|88919005
that normally
do
not
bind|257768005
to the receptor.|116647005

Since
FGF|88919005
suppresses|245780008
apoptosis,|20663007
the interdigital mesenchyme|264041005
is
maintained.|385630006

FGF also|88919005
increases|260366006
replication|74256009
and
differentiation
of osteoblasts,|48156001
thus early fusion|264499004|31883006|264499004|122501008
of several sutures|261028005|408099007|261028005|360765007
of the skull.|89546000

This
may
explain
why
both symptoms
are
always
found|404684003
in Apert Syndrome.|205258009

Surgery|83578000
is
needed to|410525008|103325001
prevent
the closing|29179001
of the coronal sutures|29012004
from damaging brain development.|12738006|278923009|258335003|278923009

In particular,
the LeFort III|257471003
or
monobloc midface distraction osteogenesis|304700003|83323007|414039005|83323007
which
detaches
the midface
or
the entire upper face,|302549007|261183002
respectively,
from the rest|258157001
of the skull|89546000
are
performed|398166005
in order
to reposition|308739004
it
in the correct plane.|260225008

These surgeries|83578000
are
performed|398166005
by
both
plastic|61088005
and
oral|260548002
and
maxillofacial
(OMS
)
surgeons,|304292004
often|70232002
in collaboration.

There
is
no standard treatment|276239002|416118004
for the hand malformations|299033004|34111000
in Apert
due to the differences|263735002
and
severity|272141005
in clinical manifestations|58147004|250255003|58147004|251190009
in different patients.|263735002|116154003

Every patient|116154003
should
therefore
be
individually
approached|103379005
and
treated,|28995006
aiming
at an adequate balance|51117008|249982003|51117008|78933003|51117008|282295000|88323005|249982003|88323005|78933003|88323005|282295000
between hand functionality|284364006
and
aesthetics.

However,
some guidelines
can
be
given|419582001
depending
on the severity|272141005
of the deformities.|276654001

In general|60132005
it
is
initially|884001
recommended
to
release|58000006|68776005|258760001|129299003|115956009
the first|255216001|232714002
and
fourth interdigital spaces thus|29970001|65464007|29970001|301200003
releasing|129299003
the border rays.|112233002|107315007|112233002|82107009

This
makes
it possible|371930009|60022001
for the child|410601007|160499008
to grasp things
with its hand,|85562004|302539009
a very important function|260358002|246464006
for the child's development.|410601007|278923009|160499008|278923009

Later
the second|81170007|257997001|288495006
and
third interdigital spaces|70905002|65464007|70905002|301200003
have
to
be
released.|68776005|129299003

Because
there
are
three handtypes|421291004
in Apert,
all
with their own deformities,|276654001
they
all
need|410525008|103325001
a different approach regarding|263735002
their treatment|276239002|416118004
:

With
growing
of a child|410601007|160499008
and
respectively
the hands,|85562004
secondary revisions|2603003|272129003|81170007|272129003
are
needed|410525008|103325001
to
treat|395077000
the contractures|55033002
and
to
improve|385425000|3442003|385633008
the aesthetics.

Common relevant features|72906007
of acrocephalosyndactyly|205258009|268262006
are
a high-arched palate,|27272007
pseudomandibular prognathism|72855002
