is
a fungal disease|3218000
caused|23981006|134198009
by _Coccidioides immitis_|23439005
or
_[C.

posadasii]
(/wiki/Coccidioides_posadasii|406645005
)
_.

It
is
endemic
in certain parts|17162000|260726005
of Arizona,|224041009
California,|224043007|25997004
Nevada,|224073003
New Mexico,|420979006
Texas,|421662006
Utah|422281007
and
northwestern Mexico.[3]|223687006

_C.

immitis_ resides
in the soil|415555003
in certain parts|17162000|260726005
of the southwestern United States,|223688001
northern Mexico,|223687006
and
parts|260726005
of Central|26216008
and
South America.|223504005

It
is
dormant
during long dry spells,|255511005|13880007
then
develops
as a mold|84489001
with long filaments|255511005
that
break
off
into airborne spores|263883009
when
the rains
come.

The spores,|263883009
known|36692007
as arthroconidia,|58988000
are
swept
into the air|417696007
by disruption|76555007
of the soil,|415555003
such as
during construction,|410615009
farming,|224816003
or
an earthquake.[5]|8766005|217739005

Infection
is
caused|23981006|134198009
by inhalation|14910006|422237004
of the particles.

The disease|64572001
is
not
transmitted|60117003|258150004
from person|125676002
to person.|125676002

The infection ordinarily
resolves
leaving|7771000|90737002
the patient|116154003
with a specific immunity to re-infection.[6]_C.|69658003|58915005|228877007

immitis_
is
a dimorphic saprophytic organism|58354000|410653004
that
grows
as a mycelium|284689008
in the soil|415555003
and
produces
a spherule form|246176004
in the host organism.|410653004

The disease|64572001
is
usually mild,|255604002
with flu-like symptoms|315642008
and
rashes.|271807003

The Mayo Clinic|223807006|35971002|223807006|257585005
estimates|414135002
that half
the population|385436007|389109008
in some affected areas|247591002|42798000|248448006|42798000
have
suffered
from the disease.|64572001

On occasion,|84638005
those particularly susceptible|131196009
may
develop
a serious|42745003
or
even fatal illness.|399166001|39104002

Serious complications|42745003|116223007
include|55919000
severe pneumonia,|24484000|205237003
lung nodules,|196662004
and
disseminated disease,|65709003|64572001
where
the fungus|414561005
spreads|410677005
throughout the body.|279495008|123037004

The disseminated form|65709003|246176004
of valley fever|442543009|417018008
can
devastate
the body,|279495008|123037004
causing|23981006
skin ulcers,|46742003
abscesses,|128477000
bone lesions,|272673000|3138006|90780006|128530007
severe joint pain,|76948002|39352004|76948002|81087007|76948002|302536002|24484000|57676002
heart inflammation,|80891009|257552002|302509004|257552002
urinary tract problems,|55607006|122489005|55607006
meningitis,|7180009
and
often death.|70232002|419620001|70232002|268923008

In order
of decreasing risk,|260371004|30207005
people|125676002
of Filipino,|76768002
African,|413464008
Native American,|413490006
Hispanic,|414408004
and
Asian descent|414978006
are
susceptible|131196009
to the disseminated form|65709003|246176004
of the disease.|64572001

Men|339947000
and
pregnant women,|255409004
and
people|125676002
with weakened immune systems|116003000
(
as
from AIDS|62479008
are
more susceptible|242762006|131196009
than non-pregnant women.|255409004

It
has
been
known|36692007

Symptomatic infection|264931009
(40%|259031006
of cases|398241000|413769002
)
usually
presents|52101004|246105001
as an influenza-like illness|95891005
with fever,|386661006
cough,|272039006
headaches,|25064002
rash,|271807003
and
myalgia|68962001
(muscle pain|68962001
).

Some patients|116154003
fail
to
recover|74822006
and
develop
chronic pulmonary infection|177010002|39607008|177010002|264164005|90734009|128601007
or
widespread disseminated infection|85333001|65709003
(affecting meninges,|247591002|363824000|248448006|363824000
soft tissues,|181607009
joints,|39352004|81087007

Severe pulmonary disease|24484000|19829001
may
develop
in HIV-infected persons.[10]|19030005|125676002|86406008|125676002|402916007|125676002

An additional risk|260364009|30207005
is
that health care providers
who
are
unfamiliar
with it
or
are
unaware|418107008|406124004
that
the patient|116154003
has
been
exposed|24932003
to it
may
misdiagnose
it
as
cancer|363346000|372087000
and
subject
the patient|116154003
to unnecessary surgery.[11]|83578000

Coccidioidomycosis|442543009

California state prisons,|224043007|398070004|25997004|398070004
as
far|46053002
back
as 1919,
have
been
particularly
affected|247591002|248448006
by Coccidioidomycosis.|442543009

In 2005
and
2006,
the Pleasant Valley State Prison|285098003|398070004|285098003|398070004|257656006
near Coalinga
and
Avenal State Prison|398070004|398070004|257656006
near Avenal
on the western side|182353008
of the San Joaquin Valley|285098003
had
the highest incidence|75540009|371879000
in 2005,
of
at least 3,000|276139006|263796003
per 100,000.[13]

Incidence
varies
widely
across the west
and
southwest.

In Arizona,|224041009
for instance,
in 2007,
there
were
3,450 cases|260313008|398241000|260313008|413769002
in Maricopa County,
which
in 2007
had
an estimated population|414135002|385436007|414135002|389109008
of 3,880,181[14]|260313008
for an incidence
of approximately 1|26175008
in 1,125.|260305007

In contrast,
though
southern New Mexico|420979006
is
considered
an endemic region,|410673009
there
were
35 cases|398241000|413769002
in the entire state|255503000|398070004|260232004|398070004
in 2008,
and
23|264657009
in 2007,
[15]
in a region|410673009
that
had
an estimated 2008 population|414135002|385436007|414135002|389109008
of 1,984,356[16]|260305007
for an incidence
of approximately 1|26175008
in 56,695.

Infection rates
vary
greatly
by county,
and
although
population density|385436007|125146005|389109008|125146005
is
important,
so
are
other factors|74964007
that
have
not
been
proven|277025001
yet.

Greater construction activity|263768009|410615009|48761009|263768009|410615009|55561003|263768009|410615009|258745004|263768009|410615009|257733005
may
disturb
spores|263883009
in the soil.|415555003

In addition,|260364009
the effect|253861007
of altitude|76661004
on fungi growth|414561005
and
morphology|116676008|72724002
has
not
been
studied|110465008|224699009
,
and
altitude|76661004
can
range
from sea level|225742004|258395000|225742004|276625007
to 10,000 feet|56459004|259051005
or
higher|75540009|371879000
across California,|224043007|25997004
Arizona,|224041009
Texas|421662006
and
New Mexico.|420979006

In California|224043007|25997004
from 2000
to 2007,
there
were
16,970 reported cases|229059009|398241000|229059009|413769002|223458004|398241000|223458004|413769002
(5.9|264706000|264605009
per 100,000 people|125676002
)
and
752 deaths|419620001|268923008
(0.26
per 100,000 people|125676002
)
with the highest incidence|75540009|371879000
in the San Joaquin Valley|285098003
(44.1
per 100,000

_C.

immitis_
was
investigated|116698004
by the United States|223688001
during the 1950s
and
1960s
as a potential biological weapon._[citation|30207005

The Cash strain|48532005|276768000
received
the military symbol OC,|302314004
and
original hopes|19535007|247798006
were
for its use|277889008|419385000
as an incapacitant.

As medical epidemiology later|74188005
made clear, OC|263707001
would
have
lethal effects|253861007
on several segments|261028005|264193005
of the population,|385436007|389109008
so
it
was
later
considered
a lethal agent.|260872001

It
was
never
standardized
,
and
beyond a few field trials,|57176003|255798002|110465008
it
was
never
weaponized.

Most military work|302314004|261041009
on OC
was
on vaccines|398827000
by the mid-1960s.|255562008

It
is
still
on the CDC's list
of select agents however.[18]|260872001

The fungal infection|3218000
can
be
demonstrated
by microscopic detection|84496004
of diagnostic cells|439401001|4421005|261004008|4421005
in body fluids,|32457005
exudates,|247450001
sputum|45710003
and
biopsy-tissue.|86273004|85756007

With specific nucleotide primers _C.immitis_ DNA|69658003|71211001|24851008
can
be
amplified
by PCR.|258066000|103338009

It
can
also
be
detected|260373001
in culture|252398009|61594008
by morphological identification|116676008|286672002|116676008|7882003|72724002|286672002|72724002|7882003
or
by
using|260676000
molecular probes|290005005|7402007
that hybridize
with _C.immitis_ RNA.|27888000

An indirect demonstration|255541007
of fungal infection|3218000
can
be
achieved
also
by serologic analysis|27377004|272389005
detecting|260373001
fungal antigen|116637007
or
host antibody|68498002|112133008

Mild cases often|255604002|398241000|70232002|255604002|413769002|70232002

or
disseminated disease,|65709003|64572001

Alternatively,
itraconazole|387532006

be
used.[19]|394850002
