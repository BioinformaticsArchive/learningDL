)
is
an inflammatory lesion
at the labial commissure,|83299001
or
corner
of the mouth,|74262004|123851003|21082005|181220002
and
often|70232002
occurs|272120004
bilaterally.

The condition|260905004
manifests|250255003
as deep cracks|131197000
or
splits.

In severe cases,|24484000|398241000|24484000|413769002
the splits
can
bleed|131148009
when
the mouth|74262004|123851003|21082005|181220002
is
opened|56116003
and
shallow ulcers|429040005
or
a crust|69640009
may
form.|246176004

Angular cheilitis|367523002
causes|134198009
red,|386713009|371240000
wet,|17461003
crusting|69640009
and
breakdown|40091007|125366008
of the skin|119325001|39937001|181469002
at the corner
of the mouth.[2]|74262004|123851003|21082005|181220002

Although
the sores|247348008|279074008|410713007
of angular cheilitis|367523002
may
become
infected
by the fungus _Candida albicans_|414561005|20849004|414561005|411818003
(thrush|78048006|79740000|107182005
)
,
or
other pathogens,|74964007|264418008
studies|110465008|224699009
have
linked
the initial onset|884001|77374008|232714002|77374008
of angular cheilitis|367523002
with nutritional deficiencies,|248325000
namely riboflavin|13235001
(vitamin B2[4][5]|13235001
and
iron deficiency anemia,|87522002
[5]|264706000|264605009
which in turn|282987006
may
be
evidence|18669006
of poor diets|310502008
or
malnutrition|248325000
(e.g.|258795003

celiac disease.|396331005

Zinc deficiency|238124008
has
also
been
associated|47429007
with angular cheilitis.|367523002

Angular cheilitis|367523002
can
also
be
a sign|72670004
of anorexia nervosa|56882008
and/or
bulimia nervosa|78004001
due|42752001
both
to malnutrition|248325000
and
as a side effect
of constant vomiting.|249497008

Cheilosis|16459000
may
also
be
part|260726005
of a group|261586004|160481000|389109008
of symptoms
(upper esophageal web,|11266002
iron deficiency anemia,|87522002
glossitis,|45534005
and
cheilosis|16459000
)
defining
the condition|260905004
called
Plummer-Vinson syndrome|80126007
(aka Paterson-Brown-Kelly syndrome|80126007
).

Angular cheilitis|367523002
occurs|272120004
frequently|70232002
in the elderly population|105436006|385436007|105436006|389109008
who
experience
a loss
of vertical dimension|33096000|255506008
due to loss
of teeth,|38199008
thus
allowing
for over-closure|21481007|112695004
of the mouth.|74262004|123851003|21082005|181220002

Less severe cases|276139006|24484000|398241000|276139006|24484000|413769002|263796003|24484000|398241000|263796003|24484000|413769002
occur|272120004
when
it
is
quite cold|285686007|82272006|84162001
(
such as
in the winter time|410669006
)
,
and
is
widely
known|36692007
as
having
chapped
lips.|261114002

Individuals|125676002|385435006
may
lick|38090009
their lips|261114002
in an attempt to
provide
a temporary moment|14803004
of relief,|224978009
only
serving
to
worsen|230993007|390772001
the condition.[7]|260905004

Angular cheilitis|367523002
can
be
caused|23981006|134198009
by bacteria,|409822003
but
is
more commonly|242762006
a fungal infection.|3218000

It
can
also
be
caused|23981006|134198009
by medications|410942007
which
dry|13880007
the skin,|119325001|39937001|181469002
including|55919000
isotretinoin|429464002
(Accutane
)
,
an analog
of vitamin A.|82622003

Less commonly,|276139006|263796003
it
is
associated|47429007
with primary hypervitaminosis A [8],|63161005|64559002|261424001|64559002
which
can
occur|272120004
when
large amounts|255509001|107651007
of liver|10200004|181268008
(
including|55919000
cod liver oil|126082008
and
other fish oils|74964007|346441008
)
are
regularly
consumed
or
as a result|394617004
from an excess intake|260378005
of vitamin A|82622003
in the form|246176004
of vitamin supplements.|87708000|373453009

Treatment|276239002|416118004
of angular cheilitis|367523002
varies
depending
on the cause.|134198009

For minor cases|410599005|398241000|410599005|413769002|255606000|398241000|255606000|413769002
caused|23981006|134198009
by bacterial infection,|301811001
applying|410618006|417924000
a topical antibiotic|255631004|359540000|255631004
to the area|42798000
for several days|261028005|258703001
is
sufficient to|51117008
treat|395077000
the infection
and
heal|298005009
the lesions.

Minor cases|410599005|398241000|410599005|413769002|255606000|398241000|255606000|413769002
caused|23981006|134198009
by a fungal infection|3218000
can
be
treated|28995006
by over-the-counter antifungal creams|80288002|373219008|255621006
(e.g.|258795003

clotrimazole.[9]|387325003
