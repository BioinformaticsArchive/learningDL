also
known|36692007
as
*
*anophthalmos|7183006
*
*
(Greek|1451003
: ??????????,
"
without eye"|81745001|244486005
)
,
is
the congenital absence|24216005
of one|421379005
or
both eyes.|81745001

It
is
a medical term|74188005
that
describes
the lack|41277001
of eye|81745001|244486005
of occular tissue|85756007
and
globe|81745001|244486005
from the eye.|81745001|244486005

[1]|260305007
The absence|2667000|418560003
of the eye|81745001|244486005
will
cause|23981006|134198009
a small bony orbit,|255507004|110528008
a constricted mucosal socket,|313268005|335901003
short eyelids,|359530003|80243003|367450005|80243003
reduced|260400001
palpebral fissure|595000|280576003
and
malar hypoplasia.|13881006|55199003

[2] Anophthalmia|260306008|7183006
can
be
congenital|6160004|255399007
or
it
can
be
acquired|255396000
later in life.|224130005

Genetic mutations,|55446002
chromosomal abnormalities,|409709004
and
prenatal environment|276339004
can
all cause anophthalmia.|134198009|7183006

Anophthalmia|7183006
is
an extremely rare disease|84638005|64572001|103356009|64572001
and
is
mostly
rooted|85077000|2338009|285110007
in genetic abnormalities.|3950001|276654001|255395001|276654001

It
can
also
be
associated|47429007
with other syndromes.|74964007

Anophthalmia|7183006
has
been
reported|229059009|223458004
to
be
present|52101004|246105001
in 3|260313008
out of every 100,000 births.|3950001

Many instances|260396001
of anophthalmia also|7183006
occur|272120004
with microphthalmia.|204108000

A recent study|6493001|110465008|6493001|224699009
in England|223664003
indicated|410535002
that anophthalmia|7183006
and
microphthalmia|204108000
had
a combined average|89780004
of 1
in every 10,000 births.|3950001

The annual rate|53281000
of occurrence|272120004
of anophthalmia/microphthalmia|7183006|204108000
in the United States|223688001
is
about 780 children|410601007|160499008
born|106970005|81827009|398209006
/year.|258707000|259039008

Parents|40683002
that already
have
a child|410601007|160499008
who
suffers
from anophthalmia|7183006
has
a 1
in 8 chance
of
having
another child|410601007|160499008
with anophthalmia.|7183006

[5] Approximately 2/3|264706000|26175008|264605009|26175008
of all cases|398241000|413769002
of anophthalmia|7183006
are
determined
to
be
of genetic basis.|3950001|3950001|418836005|255395001|255395001|418836005

Anophthalmia|7183006
is
one|421379005
of the leading causes|236874000|134198009
of congenital blindness|95486002
and
accounts
for 3-11%|260313008
of blindness
in children.|410601007|160499008

[6] Anophthalmia|7183006
and
microphthalmia together make up 1.7-1.8%|204108000|255532002|204108000|353734004
of reconstructive surgical cases|83578000|398241000|83578000|413769002
in laboratory|52101004|261904005|18720000|261904005
of plastic surgery|394611003|286553006
and
ocular prostheses.|421168009

The most genetic based cause|4757001|3950001|134198009|4757001|3950001|418836005|134198009|4757001|255395001|134198009|4757001|255395001|418836005|134198009
for anophthalmia|7183006
is
caused|23981006|134198009
by the Sox2 gene.|67271001

*
*Sox2 anophthalmia syndrome|7183006
*
*
is
caused|23981006|134198009
by a mutation|55446002
in the Sox2 gene|67271001
that
does
not
allow
it to
produce
the Sox2 protein|88878007
that
regulates
the activity|48761009|55561003|258745004|257733005
of other genes|74964007|67271001
by binding|257768005
to certain regions|17162000|410673009
of DNA.|24851008

Without this Sox2 protein,|88878007
the activity|48761009|55561003|258745004|257733005
of genes|67271001
that
is
impotant
for the development|278923009
of the eye|81745001|244486005
is
disrupted.

Sox2 anophthalmia syndrome|7183006
is
an autosomal dominant inheritance,|263681008
but
the majority
of patients|116154003
who
suffer
from Sox2 anophthalmia|7183006
are
the first|255216001|232714002
in their family history to|57177007
have
this mutation.|55446002

In certain cases,|17162000|398241000|17162000|413769002
one parent|421379005|40683002
will
possess
the mutated gene only|55446002|67271001
in their egg|102263004|263828003
or
sperm cell|6789008
and
the offspring|160499008
will
inherit|255404009
it
through
that.

This
is
called
*
*germline mosaicism|8855009
*
*.

There
are
at least 33 mutations|276139006|264667004|55446002|263796003|264667004|55446002
in the Sox2 gene|67271001
that
have
been
known|36692007
to
cause|23981006|134198009
anophthalmia.|7183006

Some
of these gene mutations|67271001|55446002
will
cause|23981006|134198009
the Sox2 protein|88878007
not to
be
formed|35810008
,
while
other mutations|74964007|55446002
will
yield
a non-functional version|42044006|22303008
of this protein.|88878007

Sox2
is
not
the only gene|50607009|67271001|420295001|67271001
that
can
cause|23981006|134198009
anophthalmia.|7183006

Other important genes|74964007|67271001
include|55919000
*
*OTX2,
CHX10
*
*
and
*
*RAX
*
*.

Each
of these genes|67271001
are
an important
in retinal expression.|5665001|10012005|103067001|10012005

Mutations|55446002
in these genes|67271001
can
cause|23981006|134198009
a failure|76797004
of retinal differentiation,|5665001|103067001
which
will
[9] OTX2
is
dominantly
inherited|255404009
and
varies
in severity.|272141005

It
has
also
been
linked
with microphthalmia.|204108000

*
*BMP4
*
*
is
also
linked
in anophthalmia|7183006
is
also
a cause|134198009
of myopia,|57190000
microphthalmia|204108000
and
is
dominantly
inherited.|255404009

BMP4
interacts
with Sonic Hedgehog pathway|106922004|388917009
and
can
cause|23981006|134198009
anophthalmia.|7183006

[10]

Many environmental conditions|276339004|260905004
have
also
been
known|36692007
to
cause|23981006|134198009
anophthalmia.|7183006

The strongest support|260404005|9096001|260404005|243114000
for environmental causes|276339004|134198009
has
been
studies|110465008|224699009
where children|410601007|160499008
have
had
*
*gestational-acquired infections|255402008|255396000
*
*.

These infections
are
typically viral.

A few known viruses|57176003|36692007|49872002
that
can
cause|23981006|134198009
anophthalmia|7183006
are
toxiplasmosis,
rubella,|36653000
and
certain strands|17162000
of the flu virus.|6142004|49872002|6142004

[11] Other known environmental conditions|36692007|276339004|260905004
that
have
led|88488004|236874000
to anophthalmia|7183006
are
maternal vitamin A deficiency,|72705000|72000004
exposure|71677004|24932003
to X-rays|52250000|168537006
during gestation,|289908002
solvent misuse,|428495004
and
exposure|71677004|24932003
to thalidomide.|404878004

[12]

An interstitial deletion
of chromosome 14|66933007
has
been
known|36692007
to occasionally
be
the source|260753009
of anophthalmia.|7183006

The deletion
of this region|410673009
of chromosome|91272006
has
also
been
associated|47429007
with patients|116154003
having
a small tongue,|249380003
and
high arched palate,|27272007
developmental|278923009
and
growth retardation,|444896005
undescended testes|204878001
with a micropenis,|34911001
and
hypothyroidism.|40930008

The region|410673009
that
has
been
deleted
is
region q22.1-q22.3.|410673009

This
confirms|59156000
that region 22|410673009
on chromosome 14|66933007
influences
the development|278923009
of the eye.|81745001|244486005

[13]

There
are
three classifications|421291004|73504009
for this condition|260905004
:

Ultrasounds|359659005
can
be
used|394850002
to
diagnose|439401001
anophthalmia|7183006
during gestation.|289908002

Due to the resolution
of the ultrasound,|359659005
however,
it
is
hard to|72505002
diagnose|439401001
it
until
the second trimester.|255247007

The earliest to|264499004
detect|260373001
anophthalmia|7183006
this way
is
approximately 20 weeks.|26175008|258705008

[14] 3D|264672008
and
4D ultrasounds|264686007|359659005
have
proven|277025001
to
be
more accurate|242762006|263656005
at viewing|246516004
the fetus's eyes|81745001|83418008|81745001
during pregnancy|289908002
and
are
another alternative
to the standard ultrasound.|359659005

It
is
possible to|371930009|60022001
diagnose|439401001
prenatally
with amniocentesis,|34536000
but
it
may
not
show
a correct negative result.|260385009|394617004

Amniocentesis|34536000
can
only
diagnose|439401001
anophthalmia|7183006
when
there
is
a chromosomal abnormality.|409709004

Chromosomal abnormalities|409709004
are
only
a minority|410599005|255606000
of cases|398241000|413769002
of anophthalmia.|7183006

[14]

MRIs|113091000
and
CTs|246611002
can
be
used|394850002
to
scan|373205008
the brain|12738006|258335003
and
orbits.|363654007

Clinicians
use|277889008|419385000
this to
assess
the internal structures|260521003
of the globe,|81745001|244486005
the optic nerve|18234004|180938001
and
extraocular muscles,|67833000
and
brain anatomy.|12738006|91723000|258335003|91723000

Physicians,|309343006
specifically ophthalmologists,|422234006
can
examine|64049009
the child|410601007|160499008
and
give|419582001
a correct diagnosis.|439401001

Some
will
do
molecular genetics|290005005
tests|269814003|272393004
to
see|281004000
if
the cause|134198009
is
linked
with gene mutations.|67271001|55446002

There
are
a few conditions|57176003|260905004
that
are
associated|47429007
with Anophthalmia.|7183006

These
include|55919000
:
[15]

Aside from these associative conditions,|260905004
anophthalmia|7183006
in only one eye|50607009|421379005|81745001|50607009|421379005|244486005|420295001|421379005|81745001|420295001|421379005|244486005
tends
to
be
associated|47429007
with complications|116223007
in the other eye.|74964007|81745001|74964007|244486005

These risks|30207005
include|55919000
a higher chance|75540009|371879000
of
having
glaucoma|23986001
or
a detached retina.|42059000

Currently,|15240007
there
is
not
a treatment option|276239002|416118004
for regaining vision|281004000
by developing
a new eye.|7147002|81745001|7147002|244486005

There
are
,
however,
cosmetic options|81024003|261513001
so
the absence|2667000|418560003
of the eye|81745001|244486005
is
not
as noticeable.

Typically,
the child|410601007|160499008
will
need|410525008|103325001
to
go
to a prosthetic specialist to|309395003
have
conformers|414945004
fitted|91175000|102499006
into the eye.|81745001|244486005

Conformers|414945004
are
made
of clear plastic|263707001|61088005
and
are
fitted|91175000|102499006
into the socket to|335901003
promote
socket growth|335901003
and
expansion.

As the child's face|410601007|89545001|410601007|302549007|160499008|89545001|160499008|302549007
grows
and
develops
,
the conformer|414945004
will
need|410525008|103325001
to
be
changed.|243326001|263703002

An expander
may
also
be
needed|410525008|103325001
in anophthalmia to|7183006
expand|70955005
the socket|335901003
that
is
present.|52101004|246105001

The conformer|414945004
is
changed|243326001|263703002
every few weeks|57176003|258705008
the first two years|255216001|420797005|258707000|232714002|420797005|258707000
of life.|224130005

After
that,
a painted prosthetic eye|36864000|421168009
can
be
fitted|91175000|102499006
for the child's socket.|410601007|335901003|160499008|335901003

[16]
The prosthetic eye|421168009
can
be
cleaned|228402009
with mild baby soap|255604002|418119000|25780000
and
water.|11713004|119318008

Rubbing alcohol|414547000
should
be
avoided
because
it
may
damage|37782003
the prosthetic eye.|421168009

Children|410601007|160499008
need|410525008|103325001
to
be
checked|360160009
regularly to
ensure
the fit|91175000|102499006
and
size|277049003
is
appropriate.

[17]

If
the proper actions|129264002
are
not
taken|419652001
to
expand|70955005
the orbit,|363654007|181143004
many physical deformities|5880005|276654001|19388002|276654001
can
appear.

It
is
important
that
if
these deformities|276654001
do
appear
,
that surgery|83578000
is
not
done
until
at least
the first two years|255216001|420797005|258707000|232714002|420797005|258707000
of life.|224130005

Many people|260396001|125676002
get
eye surgery,|422191005
such as upper eyelid ptosis surgery|38934000|11934000|83578000|38934000|29696001|83578000|244499008|11934000|83578000|244499008|29696001|83578000|261183002|11934000|83578000
and
lower eyelid tightening.|62736007

These surgeries|83578000
can
