is
a disorder|64572001
of the bone marrow.|279729006

It
is
currently|15240007
classified|73504009
as a myeloproliferative disease|425333006
in which
the proliferation|30217000
of an abnormal type|263654008|261664005
of bone marrow stem cell|279729006|418318001|279729006|419758009
results|394617004
in fibrosis,|263756000
or
the replacement|3137001|282089006
of the marrow|227250008
with collagenous connective tissue fibers.[1]|255418002|5179005

Myelofibrosis|307651005|52967002
was
first|255216001|232714002
described
in 1879
by Gustav Heuck.[2][3]

Older terms|70753007
include|55919000
"myelofibrosis|307651005|52967002
with myeloid metaplasia"|307651005|443230004
and
"agnogenic myeloid metaplasia".|307651005

The World Health Organization|263775005|21139007
utilizes
the name "chronic idiopathic myelofibrosis",|307651005|52967002
while
the International Working Group|261041009|261586004|261041009|160481000|261041009|389109008
on Myelofibrosis Research|307651005|52967002
and
Treatment|276239002|416118004
calls
the disease "primary myelofibrosis".|64572001|307651005

Eponyms
for the disease|64572001
are
Heuck-Assmann disease|64572001
or
Assmann's Disease,|64572001
for Herbert Assmann,
[4]|260308009
who
published
a description
under the term "osteosclerosis"|49347007
in 1907.[5]

It
was
characterised
as a myeloproliferative condition|260905004
in 1951
by Dameshek.

The Leukaemia|87163000
and
Lymphoma Society|118600007
classifies|73504009
Myelofibrosis|307651005|52967002
as a rare type|84638005|261664005|103356009|261664005
of blood cancer,|269475001|129154003
manifesting|250255003
as a type|261664005
of chronic leukaemia.|92812005

The principal site|63161005|10546003|302311007|10546003
of extramedullary hematopoiesis|42952007
in myeloid metaplasia|307651005|443230004
with primary myelofibrosis|307651005
is
the spleen|78961009|181279003
which
is
usually markedly|46998006
enlarged|260376009|118452000
,
sometimes
weighing|39857003
as
much
as 4000 g.|258795003

As is always true|31874001
when
splenomegaly|16294009
is
massive, multiple subcapsular infarcts|46998006|27876002|61397002
are
often|70232002
present.|52101004|246105001

Histologically|67151002
the spleen|78961009|181279003
contains|42504009
normoblast,|84227004
granulocyte precursor|256909001
and
megakaryocytes,|23592000
which
are
often prominent|70232002|4657009
in terms
of their numbers|410680006|410681005
and
bizarre morphology.|116676008|72724002

Sometimes disproportional activity|48761009|55561003|258745004|257733005
of any one|421379005
of the three major cell lines|421291004|255603008|4421005|50009006|421291004|255603008|362837007|50009006
is
seen.

The liver|10200004|181268008
is
often moderately|70232002
enlarged|260376009|118452000
,
with foci|87017008
of extramedullary hematopoiesis.|42952007

Microscopically,
lymph nodes also|59441001
contain|42504009
foci|87017008
of hematopoiesis,|416906007
but
these
are
insufficient to|71978007|423437008
cause|23981006|134198009
enlargement.|56246009|118452000|442021009

The bone marrow|279729006
in a typical case|398241000
is
hypocellular|55199003
and
diffusely fibrotic.|263756000

Both
early|264499004
and
late|260383002
in disease,|64572001
megakaryocytes|23592000
are
often prominent|70232002|4657009
and
are
usually dysplastic.|25723000

The bone marrow|279729006
is
replaced|282089006|370124000
by collagen fibrosis,|61472002|263756000
impairing|260379002
the patient's ability to|116154003|371150009
generate
new blood cells|7147002|63370004
resulting|42752001
in a progressive pancytopenia.|255314001|127034005

It
is
usually reactive|11214006
following|255260001
other myeloproliferative disorders,|74964007|425333006
such as polycythemia vera,|109992005
chronic myeloid leukemia|92818009
or
essential thrombocytosis.|109994006

Extramedullary haematopoeisis
occurs|272120004
as the haemopoetic cells|4421005
migrate
away
from the bone marrow,|279729006
to the liver|10200004|181268008
and
spleen.|78961009|181279003

Patients often|116154003|70232002
have
hepatosplenomegaly|36760000
and
poikilocytosis.|165479004

In primary myelofibrosis,|307651005
a progressive scarring|255314001|255314001|275322007
(fibrosis|263756000
of the bone marrow|279729006
occurs.|272120004

As a result,|394617004
blood|87612001|119273009
forms|246176004
in sites|10546003
other than the bone marrow,|279729006
such as the liver|10200004|181268008
and
spleen.|78961009|181279003

This
causes|134198009
an enlargement|56246009|118452000|442021009
of these organs.|410653004

The cause|134198009
and
risk factors|80943009
are
unknown.|261665006

It commonly
occurs|272120004
in the spent phase|21191007
of Polycythemia rubra vera,|109992005
possibly|60022001
in response
to the medication hydroxyurea|410942007|387314007
poisoning|75478009
the marrow|227250008
and
blood.|87612001|119273009

The one known treatment|421379005|36692007|276239002|421379005|36692007|416118004
is
allogeneic stem cell transplantation,|50223000|418318001|50223000|419758009
but
this approach
involves|248448006
significant risks.|386134007|30207005

Other treatment options|74964007|276239002|74964007|416118004
are
largely supportive,
and
do
not
alter
the course|288524001
of the disorder.|64572001

These options
may
include|55919000
regular folic acid,|17854005|63718003|17854005|104660009
[11] allopurinol[12]|387135004
or
blood transfusions.

Dexamethasone,|372584003
alpha-interferon|45754009
and
hydroxycarbamide|387314007
may
play|300776002
a role.[14][15][16]

Lenalidomide|421471009
and
thalidomide|404878004
may
be
used|394850002
in its treatment,|276239002|416118004
though
they
can
cause|23981006|134198009
gout|90560007
and
leave|7771000|90737002
the patient|116154003
susceptible|131196009
to diseases|64572001
such as pneumonia.[16]|205237003

Frequent blood transfusions|70232002
may
also
be
required.

If
the patient|116154003
is
diabetic
and
is
taking|419652001
sulfonylureas medication|372711004|410942007
this
should
be
stopped|385654001
periodically to|81591007
rule|10828004
out drug-induced thrombocytopenia._[citation|255529000|278993004|415116008

In November 2011,
the FDA approved ruxolitinib|9571008
(Jakafi
)
as a treatment|276239002|416118004
for myelofibrosis.|307651005|52967002

Ruxolitinib
is
a twice daily drug|229799001|410942007
which
serves
as an inhibitor|61511001
of JAK 1
and
2.

The _New England Journal of Medicine_ (NEJM) published results|7147002|223664003|410942007|394617004
from two Phase III|420797005|21191007|257471003
studies|110465008|224699009
of Jakafi?
(ruxolitinib
)
,
a JAK1
and
JAK2 inhibitor recently|61511001|6493001
approved|9571008
by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA)|255620007|18629005
for the treatment|276239002|416118004
of intermediate|11896004
or
high-risk myelofibrosis|15508007|307651005|15508007|52967002
(MF
).

These data,
which
were
included|55919000
in the New Drug Application|7147002|410942007|410618006
for Jakafi,
showed
that
the treatment significantly reduced spleen volume|276239002|260400001|78961009|118565006|276239002|260400001|78961009|419569009|276239002|260400001|181279003|118565006|276239002|260400001|181279003|419569009|416118004|260400001|78961009|118565006|416118004|260400001|78961009|419569009|416118004|260400001|181279003|118565006|416118004|260400001|181279003|419569009
and
improved symptoms|385425000|3442003
of MF.

Additionally,
in an updated analysis,|272389005
treatment|276239002|416118004
with Jakafi
was
associated|47429007
with improved overall survival|385425000|3442003
compared
to placebo.[19][20]

The disorder usually|64572001
develops
slowly|419443000
and
is
mainly
observed
in people|125676002
over the age|424144002
of 50.

It
may
also
develop
as a side-effect
of treatment|276239002|416118004
with some drugs|410942007
that
target
hematological disorders.|34093004
