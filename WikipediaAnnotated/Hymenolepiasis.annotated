*Hymenolepiasis|44917000
*
*
is
infestation|17322007|33042004
by one|421379005
of two species|420797005|69658003
of tapeworm|86133004|79501007
:

Alternative names
are
:

_Hymenolepis_ worms|76403008|27601005|76403008|26089000
live|419749002
in the intestines|261093006
of rats|371565004|371564000
and
are
common|72906007
in warm climates.

Hymenolepis|76403008
is
generally
found|404684003
in the feces|39477002
of rats|371565004|371564000
which
is
consumed
by its secondary hosts|2603003|81170007
:
beetles.|106765005

The worms|27601005|26089000
mature|34071009
into a life form|224130005|246176004
referred|439980006
to
as a "cysticercoid"
in the insect|106763003
;
in _H.|89177007|258322007|286551008

nana,
_
the insect|106763003
is
always
a beetle.|106765005

Humans|278412004
and
other animals|74964007|387961004
become
infected
when
they intentionally
or
unintentionally eat material|48263008|260769002
contaminated|62604006
by insects.|106763003

In an infected person,|125676002
it
is
possible|371930009|60022001
for the worm's entire life-cycle to|27601005|255503000|224130005|44180009|27601005|260232004|224130005|44180009|37017009|255503000|224130005|44180009|37017009|260232004|224130005|44180009
be
completed|255594003
in the bowel,|261093006
so
infection
can
persist
for years|258707000
if
left|7771000
untreated.|25265005

_Hymenolepis nana_ infections|77412003
are
much more common|242762006|72906007|4757001|72906007
than _Hymenolepis diminuta_ infections|36334003
in humans because,|278412004
in addition|260364009
to
being
spread|410677005
by insects,|106763003
the disease|64572001
can
be
spread|410677005
directly
from person|125676002
to person|125676002
by eggs|102263004
in feces.|39477002

When
this happens,
_H.|89177007|258322007|286551008

nana_ oncosphere larvae
encyst|255283003
in the intestinal wall|360972004
and
develop
into cysticercoids
and
then adults.|133936004

These infections
were
previously common|72906007
in the southeastern USA,|223688001
and
have
been
described
in crowded environments|276339004
and
individuals|125676002|385435006
confined
to institutions.|385437003

However,
the disease|64572001
occurs|272120004
throughout the world.

_H.|89177007|258322007|286551008

nana_ infections
can
grow
worse|230993007|390772001|231877006
over time because,|410669006
unlike
in most tapeworms,|79501007
_H.|89177007|258322007|286551008

nana_ eggs|102263004
can
hatch
and
develop
without ever
leaving|7771000|90737002
the definitive host.|261002007

A study|110465008|224699009
in Connecticut|224045000
found|404684003
that one third|421379005|70905002
of rats|371565004|371564000
sold
in pet stores|440276004
were
infected
with _H.|89177007|258322007|286551008

nana_
and
concluded
that
these
and
other rodents|74964007|388077003
sold
in pet stores|440276004
pose
a potential threat|30207005
to public health.|310115006

The risk|30207005
of human infection|278412004
from _H.|89177007|258322007|286551008

diminuta_
is
very low,|260362008
since
its main host|63161005
is
the rat.|371565004|371564000

Also
known|36692007
as the
*
*rat tapeworm|36334003|23895005
*
*,
_H.|89177007|258322007|286551008

diminuta_ adults|133936004
live|419749002
and
mate|262043009
in the bowels|261093006
of rats.|371565004|371564000

Eggs|102263004
of _H.|89177007|258322007|286551008

diminuta_
are
excreted|418678001
by the rats|371565004|371564000
as droppings,|272168005
which
are
frequently|70232002
consumed
by beetles.|106765005

Once
inside the beetle,|106765005
the eggs|102263004
mature|34071009
into a
*
*cysticercoid
*
*.

The juvenile tapeworms|133937008|79501007
claw|58575009
their way
out of the beetle gut|106765005|122865005
into the circulatory system|113257007
by means of their three pairs|421291004
of hooks.|260883005

There,
they
wait
for a rat to|371565004|371564000
ingest|111984006
the host beetle,|106765005
where
they mature|34071009
to adult form,|133936004|246176004
lay eggs|102263004
and
restart
the entire cycle.[1]|255503000|44180009|260232004|44180009

_H.|89177007|258322007|286551008

diminuta_
has
an effective mechanism|255403003|257544000|254648000|257544000
for interspecies transfection.

Beetles|106765005
prefer|225773000
to
ingest|111984006
rat droppings|371565004|272168005|371564000|272168005
infected
with tapeworm eggs,|284724005
because of their odor.|103371008

It
is
not
known|36692007
if
the odor|103371008
is
produced specifically
by the eggs|102263004
or
the droppings.|272168005

_H.|89177007|258322007|286551008

diminuta_ also
sterilizes
its beetle host,|106765005
if
female.|248152002|224526002

This
is
so|223528007
the beetle|106765005
does
not
waste
energy|248272003
in its reproductive system,|278875001|263767004
allowing
_H.|89177007|258322007|286551008

diminuta_
to further|46053002
exploit
the beetle?s metabolic resources.[1]|106765005

_Hymenolepis nana_|74311004
is
a tapeworm,|86133004|79501007
belonging
to the class Cestoidea,|79501007
phylum platyhelmenthes.

It
consists
of a linear series|50009006|13039001
of sets
of reproductive organs|410653004
of
both
sexes|258139002|365952006|263495000|70256003|57312000
;
each set
is
referred to|439980006
as
a genitaluim
and
the area arount|42798000
it
is
a proglottid.

New proglottids|7147002
are
continuously
differentiated|263933003
near the anterior end|255549009|261782000|255549009|422117008
in a process|415178003
called
strobilation.

Each segment|264193005
moves|302000008
toward the posterior end|255551008|261782000|255551008|422117008
as a new one|7147002|421379005
takes|419652001
its place|257557008|421066005
and
,
during the process,|415178003
becomes
sexually mature.|365952006|34071009

The proglottid
can
copulate
with itself
with others|74964007
in the strobilla,
or
with those in other worms.|52101004|27601005|52101004|26089000|18720000|27601005|18720000|26089000

When
the segment|264193005
reaches|282679008
the end|261782000|422117008
of its strobila,
it
disintegrates
on route,|284009009
releasing|129299003
eggs|102263004
in a process|415178003
called
apolysis.

_Hymenolepis nana_|74311004
is
the only|50607009|420295001
cestode|79501007
that
is
capable
of completing|255594003
its life cycle|224130005|44180009
without an intermediate host.|11896004

It
can
,
however,
pass
through an intermediate host|11896004
as well.|20572008

The most common intermediate host|4757001|72906007|11896004
for _H.|89177007|258322007|286551008

nana_
are
arthropods|106762008
(ex.

Flour beetles|63766005|106765005
).

When
eggs|102263004
are
ingested|111984006
by the definitive host,|261002007
they hatch
and
release|58000006|68776005|258760001|129299003|115956009
a six hook larva|422218008|260883005
called
the oncosphere
(hexacanth
)
which
penetrates|53568006
the villi
of the small intestine|264196002|181250005
and
develop
into a cysticercoi.[3]

Transmission|258150004
of _H.nana_|89177007|258322007|286551008
occurs|272120004
via the fecal-oral route.|39477002|26643006

It also
occurs|272120004
by accidental ingestion
of insect|106763003
containing|42504009
the cysticercoid.

Methods|260686004|272394005

It
is
not
clear|263707001
that hymenolepiasis necessarily|44917000
have
any symptoms.

The symptoms
of hymenolepiasis|44917000
are
traditionally
described
as abdominal pain,|21522001
loss
of appetite|33911006
(anorexia
)
,
itching|424492005
around the anus,|53505006|181262009
irritability|55929007
and
diarrhea.|398032003

However,
in one study|421379005|110465008|421379005|224699009
of 25 patients|116154003
conducted|844005
in Peru,|223721003
successful treatment|182985004
of the infection
made
no significant difference|386134007|263735002
to symptoms.

Some authorities
report|229059009|223458004
that heavily infected cases|398241000|413769002
are
more likely to|242762006|2931005
be
symptomatic.[3][5]|264931009

Examination|5880005
of the stool|39477002
for eggs|102263004
and
parasites|37763007
confirms|59156000
the diagnosis.|439401001

The eggs|102263004
and
proglottids
of _H.|89177007|258322007|286551008

are
relatively wide|90522003
and

three testes.|421291004|36528006|421291004|279572002

Identifying|7882003
the parasites|37763007
to the species level|69658003|258395000|69658003|276625007
is
often unnecessary|70232002
from a medical perspective,|74188005
as
the treatment|276239002|416118004
is
the same|262126009
for both.

Praziquantel|387310003
as a single dose|125681006|277406006|125681006|408102007|50607009|277406006|50607009|408102007
(25 mg/kg
)
is
the current treatment|15240007|276239002|15240007|416118004
of choice
for hymenolepiasis|44917000
and
has
an efficacy
of 96%.

Single dose albendazole|125681006|277406006|387558006|125681006|408102007|387558006|50607009|277406006|387558006|50607009|408102007|387558006
(400 mg|427264006

is
also very efficacious|260358002
(
>95%
).

Niclosamide|387334008
has
also
been
used.|394850002

A three-day course|421291004|258703001|288524001|421291004|259032004|288524001
