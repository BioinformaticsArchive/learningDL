*Synovial chondromatosis|240207006|202574006
*
*
is
a disease|64572001
affecting|247591002|248448006
the synovium,|64331004
a thin flexible membrane|18043004|261012000|83097008
around a joint.|39352004|81087007|302536002

It
is
also
known|36692007
as
*
*Reichel's syndrome|240207006
*
*
or
*
*Reichel-Jones-Henderson syndrome|240207006|261864007
*
*,
named|27468005
after Friedrich Paul Reichel,
Hugh Toland Jones|261864007
and
Melvin Starkey Henderson.[1]

Patients usually|116154003
complain
of pain|22253000
in one joint,|421379005|39352004|421379005|81087007|421379005|302536002
which
persists
for months,|258706009
or
even years,|258707000
does
not
ease
with exercise,|61686008
steroid injection|296778005
or
heat treatment,|31847002
shows
nothing
on X-ray,|52250000|168537006|363680008
but
shows
a definite restriction|255545003|263856008
of movement.|255324009

There
are
3 defined stages|260313008|261612004
to this disease|64572001
:

In the early stages|264499004|261612004
of the disease|64572001
it
is
often|70232002
confused|286933003
with tendinitis|34840004
and/or
arthritis.|3723001

Once
it
reaches|282679008
transitional
the loose bodies|20456003
become
apparent
with X-ray|52250000|168537006|363680008
in greater|263768009
than 70%
of cases,|398241000|413769002
with MRI often showing|113091000|70232002
where xray|52250000|168537006|363680008
fails.

In the disease,|64572001
the thin flexible membrane|18043004|261012000|83097008
of the synovium gradually|64331004
forms|246176004
blisters|408764000|247464001
which
calcify
and
enlarge.|260376009|118452000

These nodules eventually|27925004|279365004
break
free|37837009
and
float
around the joint space|36668004
becoming
larger ?|255509001|263768009
these
add
to the discomfort|367391008|87128005
and
stiffness|271587009
of the joint.|39352004|81087007|302536002

The disease|64572001
is
rare|84638005|103356009
and
little known|281411007|36692007|255507004|36692007
and
there
is
currently|15240007
no known cure.|36692007

The affected tissue|247591002|85756007|248448006|85756007
will
show
up
as
a semi-solid mass|35702001|300848003|35702001|118538004|78910004|300848003|78910004|118538004|421378002|300848003|421378002|118538004
in a MRI scan,|113091000|373205008|113091000
final diagnosis|89100005
is
usually
confirmed|59156000
by taking
a biopsy.|86273004

Traditional medical journals|263901007|74188005
conclude
that individuals|125676002|385435006
suffering
from this disease|64572001
are
nearly always male,|248153007
and
usually
in their forties.

However,
online communities|133928008
for synovial chondromatosis patients|240207006|116154003|202574006|116154003
have
yielded
a stark contrast,
with equal representation|9726003
from
both
genders|263495000
and
members|394852005
diagnosed|439401001
as young|84422007
as late teenage/early 20s.|260383002|22396007|264499004

The disease generally|64572001
affects|4065008
only
one|421379005
of the larger weight bearing joints|255509001|249981005|39352004|255509001|249981005|81087007|263768009|249981005|39352004|263768009|249981005|81087007
(hip,|29836001|85710004
ankle,|70258002|108371006|361292008
knee ?|304679005|49076000|361291001|72696002
although
the elbow,|127949000|16953009|76248009
and
wrist|8205005|361289009|74670003
can
also
be
affected.|247591002|248448006

Treatment|276239002|416118004
is
frequently|70232002
by means of removal|118292001|128303001
of the loose bodies|20456003
and
of a partial|255609007
or
full Synovectomy|261015003|388990007
(removal|118292001|128303001
of the synovium|64331004
)

Full synovectomy|261015003|388990007
is
a moderately major operation|255603008|83578000
and
involves|248448006
completely
exposing|24932003
the joint|39352004|81087007|302536002
and
removing|127485006
the affected tissue.|247591002|85756007|248448006|85756007

Partial synovectomy|265204005
is
normally
done
arthroscopically.

Synovectomies|388990007
are
normally
carried|288345009
out
by shaving|129322004
the lining|50009006
of the knee|304679005|49076000|361291001|72696002
but
there
are
other ways|74964007
of achieving
this
by either
freezing|48103003
the synovium|64331004
or
by the use|277889008|419385000
of radiation treatment.|30821001|276239002|30821001|416118004|82107009|276239002|82107009|416118004|108290001|276239002|108290001|416118004

The need|410525008|103325001
for further procedures|46053002|71388002
is
greater|263768009
than 25%
although
normally
the frequency|260864003|272123002
of the required removal|118292001|128303001
of loose bodies|20456003
is
reduced|260400001
by the previous synovectomy.|9130008|388990007

There
have
been
documented|397934002
cases|398241000|413769002
of malignant transformation however|21594007|61883002
this
is
rare.|84638005|103356009

Whilst
the condition|260905004
can
be
described
as a ?benign growth?|30807003
it seldom|103356009
affects|4065008
more
than one joint,|421379005|39352004|421379005|81087007|421379005|302536002
and
does
not usually
affect|4065008
surrounding tissue.|355648006|85756007
