(plural|260396001
:

)
is
a fungal infection|3218000
of animals,|387961004
including|55919000
humans.|278412004

Mycoses|3218000
are
common,|72906007
and
a variety
of environmental|276339004
and
physiological conditions|1360005|260905004
can
contribute
to the development|278923009
of fungal diseases.|3218000

Inhalation|14910006|422237004
of fungal spores|46901008
or
localized colonization|255471002
of the skin|119325001|39937001|181469002
may
initiate
persistent infections|115648009
;
therefore,
mycoses|3218000
often|70232002
start|255395001
in the lungs|39607008
or
on the skin.[2]|119325001|39937001|181469002

People|125676002
are
at risk|410519009
of fungal infections|3218000
when
they
are
taking|419652001
strong antibiotics|260404005|255631004
for a long period|255511005|259037005
of time|410669006
because
antibiotics|255631004
kill|248007002
not only
damaging|37782003
bacteria,|409822003
but
healthy bacteria|263775005|409822003
as well.|20572008

This
alters
the balance|249982003|78933003|282295000
of microorganisms|264395009
in the mouth,|74262004|123851003|21082005|181220002
vagina,|76784001|181441005
intestines|261093006
and
other places|74964007|257557008
in the body,|279495008|123037004
and
results|394617004
in an overgrowth
of fungus.|414561005

Individuals|125676002|385435006
with weakened immune systems|116003000
are
also at risk|30207005
of developing fungal infections.|3218000

This
is
the case|398241000
of people|125676002
with HIV/AIDS,|19030005|62479008|86406008|62479008|402916007|62479008
people|125676002
under steroid treatments,|297279009
and
people|125676002
taking|419652001
chemotherapy.|416608005|367336001

People|125676002
with diabetes also|73211009
tend
to
develop
fungal infections.|3218000

Very young|260358002|84422007
and
very old people,|260358002|70753007|125676002
also,
are
groups at risk.[3]|258374005|30207005

Mycoses|3218000
are
classified|73504009
according to the tissue levels initially|85756007|258395000|884001
colonized.

Superficial mycoses|14560005
are
limited|255469002
to the outermost layers
of the skin|119325001|39937001|181469002
and
hair.|386045008|119326000

An example
of such
a fungal infection|3218000
is
Tinea versicolor,|56454009
a fungus infection|3218000
that commonly
affects|4065008
the skin|119325001|39937001|181469002
of young people,|84422007|125676002
especially
the chest,|261179002
back,
and
upper arms|69273007
and
legs.|30021000

Tinea versicolor|56454009
is
caused|23981006|134198009
by a fungus|414561005
that lives|224130005
in the skin|119325001|39937001|181469002
of some adults.|133936004

It
does
not usually
affect|4065008
the face.|89545001|302549007

This fungus|414561005
produces
spots|271807003|285305004
that
are
either
lighter|75926004
than the skin|119325001|39937001|181469002
or
a reddish-brown.|371254008

This fungus|414561005
exists
in two forms,|420797005|246176004
one|421379005
of them
causing|23981006
visible spots.|24054004|271807003|24054004|285305004

Factors
that
can
cause|23981006|134198009
the fungus to|414561005
become
more visible|242762006|24054004
include|55919000
high humidity,|86508006
as well as
immune|255386009
or
hormone abnormalities.|362969004

However,
almost all people|125676002
with this very common condition|260358002|72906007|260905004
are
healthy.|263775005

Cutaneous mycoses|14560005
extend|255590007
deeper|131197000
into the epidermis,|55988001
and
also
include|55919000
invasive hair|10179008|386045008|10179008|119326000
and
nail diseases.|17790008

These diseases|64572001
are
restricted|263856008
to the keratinized layers
of the skin,|119325001|39937001|181469002
hair,|386045008|119326000
and
nails.|72651009

Unlike the superficial mycoses,|14560005
host
immune responses|35024006
may
be
evoked|410658008
,
resulting|42752001
in pathologic changes|29458008|243326001|29458008|263703002
expressed
in the deeper layers|131197000
of the skin.|119325001|39937001|181469002

The organisms|410653004
that
cause|23981006|134198009
these diseases|64572001
are
called
dermatophytes.|416959009

The resulting diseases|42752001|64572001
are
often called ringworm|70232002
(even
though
there
is
no worm|27601005|37017009
involved|248448006
)
or
tinea.

Cutaneous mycoses|14560005
are
caused|23981006|134198009
by _Microsporum_,|11983001
_Trichophyton_,|88578003
and
_Epidermophyton_ fungi,|112403007|414561005
which together
comprise
41 species.|69658003

One common disease|421379005|72906007|64572001
is
the athlete's foot|6020002
which most commonly|4757001
affects|4065008
men|339947000
and
children|410601007|160499008
before puberty.|18991001

It
is
divided|422033008
in three categories|421291004
:
chronic interdigital athlete's foot,|90734009|264041005|6020002
chronic scaly athlete's foot,|90734009|19892000|6020002|90734009|13389002|6020002|90734009|278111002|6020002
and
acute vesicular athlete's foot.[4]|272118002|63727002|6020002

Subcutaneous mycoses|3218000|263887005|3218000
involve|248448006
the dermis,|53534000
subcutaneous tissues,|71966008
muscle,|91727004
and
fascia.|84820005|181772008

These infections
are
chronic|90734009
and
can
be
initiated
by piercing trauma
to the skin,|119325001|39937001|181469002
which
allows
the fungi to|414561005
enter.|417985001

These infections
are
difficult to|52925006
treat|395077000
and
may
require
surgical interventions|83578000
such as debridement.|36777000

Systemic mycoses|399314004
due to primary pathogens|63161005|264418008|261424001|264418008
originate
primarily
in the lungs|39607008
and
may
spread|410677005
to many organ systems.|91689009

Organisms|410653004
that
cause|23981006|134198009
systemic mycoses|399314004
are
inherently virulent.

Generally,
primary pathogens|63161005|264418008|261424001|264418008
that
cause|23981006|134198009
systemic mycoses|399314004
are
dimorphic.|58354000

Systemic mycoses|399314004
due to opportunistic pathogens|264418008
are
infections
of patients|116154003
with immune deficiencies|255386009|260372006|255386009|248325000
who
would
otherwise
not
be
infected.

Examples
of immunocompromised conditions|370391006|260905004
include|55919000
AIDS,|62479008
alteration
of normal flora|23506009
by antibiotics,|255631004
immunosuppressive therapy,|86553008
and
metastatic cancer.|405843009|128462008

Examples
of opportunistic mycoses|78999002
include|55919000
Candidiasis,|78048006
Cryptococcosis|42386007
and
Aspergillosis.|65553006

Antifungal drugs|373219008
are
used|394850002
to
treat|395077000
mycoses.|3218000

Depending
on the nature|277302009
of the infection,
a topical|359540000
or
systemic agent|31099001|260872001
may
be
used.|394850002

Photochemotherapy|257891001
or
photopheresis|83794005
is
a technique|272394005
used|394850002
at medical centers|288565001
for the treatment|276239002|416118004
of mycosis fungoides.|118618005

An example
of antifungal|373219008
is
fluconazole,|387174006
or
Diflucan,
which
is
the basis|418836005
of many over-the-counter antifungal treatments.|80288002|373219008|276239002

Another example
is
amphotericin B|77703004
(
the A form|246176004
being
toxic
)
which
is
more potent.|242762006|30207005

It
is
used|394850002
in the treatment|276239002|416118004
of the most severe fungal infections|4757001|24484000|3218000
that
show
resistance|30714006
to other forms|74964007|246176004
of treatment|276239002|416118004
and
it
is
administered intravenously.[5]|418283001

Drugs to|410942007
treat|395077000
skin infections|108365000
are
Tolnaftate|387204001
(Tinactin,|387204001
an over the counter topical|80288002|80288002|359540000
;
Ketoconazole,|387216007
especially
used|394850002
to
treat|395077000
tinea versicolor|56454009
and
other dermatophytes|74964007|416959009
;
Itraconazole|387532006
;
Terbinafine|373450007
(Lamisil
;
Echinocandins|373570003
(caspofungin|413770001
)
;
Griseofulvin,|372807004
commonly
used|394850002
for infections
involving|248448006
the scalp|41695006|181480002
and
nails.[6]|72651009

Yeast infections|58296003|412534006|411818003
in the vagina,|76784001|181441005
caused|23981006|134198009
by candida albicans,|20849004|411818003
can
be
treated|28995006
with medicated suppositories|385174007|385194003
and
pessaries|385174007
whereas
skin yeast infections|108365000|58296003|108365000|412534006|108365000|411818003
are
treated|28995006
with medicated ointments.[7]|385101003

Keeping
the skin|119325001|39937001|181469002
clean
and
dry,|13880007
as well as
maintaining good hygiene,|385630006|20572008|284779002
will
help
larger topical mycoses.|255509001|3218000|255509001|359540000|3218000|263768009|3218000|263768009|359540000|3218000

Because
fungal infections|3218000
are
contagious,
it
is
important
to wash
after touching other people|52962008|125676002
or
animals.|387961004

Sports|415577004
clothing|272180002
should
also
be
washed
after use.|277889008|419385000

Wearing flip-flops
if
using|260676000
a community swimming pool|133928008|257712001
or
shower
will
also
help
prevent
topical infections.|359540000
