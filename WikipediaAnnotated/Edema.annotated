is
an abnormal accumulation|263654008
of fluid|32457005|33463005|255765007
in the interstitium,
which
are
locations|246267002
beneath the skin|119325001|39937001|181469002
or
in one|421379005
or
more cavities|242762006|80967001|242762006|91806002|242762006|2483006
of the body.|279495008|123037004

It
is
clinically
shown
as swelling.|423666004|442672001

Generally,
the amount|107651007
of interstitial fluid|32457005|33463005|255765007
is
determined
by the balance|249982003|78933003|282295000
of fluid homeostasis,|32457005|21979002|33463005|21979002|255765007|21979002|21979002

cause|23981006|134198009
edema._[citation|423666004

Cutaneous edema|95322002
is
referred to|439980006
as
"pitting"|77855009
when
,
after pressure|279046003|13543005|257893003
is
applied|410618006
to a small area,|255507004|42798000
the indentation|82448003
persists
for some time|410669006
after the release|58000006|68776005|258760001|129299003|115956009
of the pressure.|279046003|13543005|257893003

Peripheral pitting edema,|271809000|77855009|14414005|284521000
as
shown
in the illustration,
is
the more common type,|242762006|72906007|261664005
resulting|42752001
from water retention.|11713004|36850000|119318008|36850000

It
can
be
caused|23981006|134198009
by systemic diseases,|264578000
pregnancy|289908002
in some women,|224526002
either
directly
or
as a result|394617004
of heart failure,|84114007|42343007
or
local conditions|255470001|260905004
such as varicose veins,|128060009
thrombophlebitis,|64156001
insect bites,|276433004
and
dermatitis.|182782007

Non-pitting edema|420435001
is
observed
when
the indentation|82448003
does
not
persist.

It
is
associated|47429007
with such
conditions|78326006|260905004
as lymphedema,|234097001
lipedema,|234102003
and
myxedema.|43153006

Edema|423666004
caused|23981006|134198009
by malnutrition|248325000

kwashiorkor|58262005
(
an acute form|272118002|246176004
of childhood protein-energy malnutrition|68433009|238107002
characterized
by edema,|423666004
irritability,|55929007
anorexia,
ulcerating|429040005
dermatoses,|95320005
and
an enlarged liver|80515008

The insufficient protein consumption,|71978007|88878007|423437008|88878007
but
with sufficient calorie intake,|51117008|226320007
distinguishes
it
from marasmus.|29740003

Kwashiorkor cases|58262005|398241000|58262005|413769002
occurs|272120004
in areas|42798000
of famine
or
poor food supply.|11403006|255620007|425398004|255351007|255620007|425398004

Cases|398241000|413769002
in the developed world
are
rare.|84638005|103356009
)

A rise
in hydrostatic pressure|285401009
occurs|272120004
in cardiac failure.|84114007|42343007

A fall|1912002
in osmotic pressure|51272001
occurs|272120004
in nephrotic syndrome|52254009
and
liver failure.|59927004

It
is
commonly
thought|88952004
that
these facts
explain
the occurrence|272120004
of edema|423666004
in these conditions.|260905004

However,
it
has
been
known|36692007
since
the 1950s
that
the situation
is
more complex|242762006|103360007
and
it
is
still far|46053002
from completely
understood.[3]|66216009

Causes|134198009
of edema|423666004
which
are
generalized|60132005
to the whole body|261188006
can
cause|23981006|134198009
edema|423666004
in multiple organs|260396001|410653004
and
peripherally.

For example,
severe heart failure|24484000|84114007|24484000|42343007
can
cause|23981006|134198009
pulmonary edema,|19242006
pleural effusions,|60046008
ascites|271861000
and
peripheral edema.|271809000

Although
a low plasma oncotic pressure|62482003|419185008|49361002|371880002|419185008|49361002
is
widely
cited
for the edema|423666004
of nephrotic syndrome,|52254009
most physicians|309343006
note
that
the edema|423666004
may
occur|272120004
before there|236874000|421718005
is
any significant protein|386134007|88878007
in the urine|78014005
(proteinuria|29738008
or
fall|1912002
in plasma protein level.|395835001|258395000|395835001|276625007|79329006|258395000|79329006|276625007|419185008|365799007

Fortunately there
is
another explanation
available.|103328004

Most
forms|246176004
of nephrotic syndrome|52254009
are
due to biochemical|80534008
and
structural changes|243326001|263703002
in the basement membrane|68989006
of capillaries|20982000
in the kidney glomeruli,|68288006
and
these changes|243326001|263703002
occur|272120004
,
if
to a lesser degree,|263796003|258395000|263796003|246173007
in the vessels|59820001
of most other tissues|74964007|85756007
of the body.|279495008|123037004

Thus
the resulting increase|42752001|260366006
in permeability|82540007
that
leads|88488004|236874000
to protein|88878007
in the urine|78014005
can
explain
the edema|423666004
if
all other vessels|74964007|59820001
are
more permeable|242762006|82540007
as well.[4]|20572008

As well as
the previously mentioned conditions,|260905004
edemas often|423666004|70232002
occur|272120004
during the late stages|260383002|261612004
of pregnancy|289908002
in some women.|224526002

This
is
more common|242762006|72906007
with those
of a history|392521001
of pulmonary problems|39607008|55607006|264164005|55607006
or
poor circulation also
being
intensified
if arthritis|3723001
is
already
present|52101004|246105001
in that particular woman.|224526002

Women|224526002
that already
have
arthritic problems most often|55607006|70232002
have
to
seek
medical|74188005
help
for pain|22253000
caused|23981006|134198009
from over-reactive swelling.|21481007|11214006|423666004|21481007|11214006|442672001

Edemas|423666004
that
occur|272120004
during pregnancy|289908002
are
usually
found|404684003
in the lower part|261122009|260726005
of the leg,|61685007|30021000|182281004|362793004
usually
from the calf|53840002|244015008
down.

An edema|423666004
will
occur|272120004
in specific organs|69658003|410653004
as part|260726005
of inflammations,|257552002
tendinitis|34840004
or
pancreatitis,|75694006
for instance.

Certain organs|17162000|410653004
develop
edema|423666004
through tissue specific mechanisms.|85756007|69658003|257544000

Examples
of edema|423666004
in specific organs|69658003|410653004
:

Six factors|422218008
can
contribute
to the formation|11798007|255277001
of edema|423666004
:

Generation
of interstitial fluid|32457005|33463005|255765007
is
regulated
by the forces
of the Starling equation.|396725005|107199006

Hydrostatic pressure|285401009
within blood vessels|59820001
tends
to
cause|23981006|134198009
water to|11713004|119318008
filter|116250002|258648006
out
into the tissue.|85756007

This
leads|88488004|236874000
to a difference|263735002
in protein concentration|250413009|365653004
between blood plasma|419185008
and
tissue.|85756007

As a
result|394617004
the oncotic pressure|49361002
of the higher level|75540009|258395000|75540009|276625007|371879000|258395000|371879000|276625007
of protein|88878007
in the plasma|419185008
tends
to
draw
water|11713004|119318008
back
into the blood vessels|59820001
from the tissue.|85756007

Starling's equation|396725005|107199006
states|398070004
that
the rate
of leakage|76676007
of fluid|32457005|33463005|255765007
is
determined
by the difference|263735002
between the two forces|420797005
and
also
by the permeability|82540007
of the vessel wall|59820001|224727009
to water,|11713004|119318008
which
determines
the rate
of flow
for a given force imbalance.|285653008

Most water leakage|11713004|76676007|119318008|76676007
occurs|272120004
in capillaries|20982000
or
post capillary venules,|288563008|20982000|57766006|288563008|255416003|57766006
which
have
a semi-permeable membrane wall|82540007|83097008|224727009
that
allows
water to|11713004|119318008
pass
more freely|242762006
than protein.|88878007

(
The protein|88878007
is
said to|66049007
be
reflected|225436004
and
the efficiency|260375008
of reflection
is
given|419582001
by a reflection constant
of
up to 1.|260305007
)
If
the gaps
between the cells|4421005
of the vessel wall|59820001|224727009
open|56116003
up then permeability|82540007
to water|11713004|119318008
is
increased first,|35105006|255216001|35105006|232714002|260366006|255216001|260366006|232714002
but
as the gaps
increase|260366006
in size permeability|277049003|82540007
to protein also|88878007
increases|260366006
with a fall|1912002
in reflection coefficient.

Changes|243326001|263703002
in the variables|255372005
in Starling's equation|396725005|107199006
can
contribute
to the formation|11798007|255277001
of edemas|423666004
either
by an increase|260366006
in hydrostatic pressure|285401009
within the blood vessel,|59820001|361097006
a decrease|260400001|260370003
in the oncotic pressure|49361002
within the blood vessel|59820001|361097006
or
an increase in vessel wall permeability.|260366006|59820001|224727009|82540007

The latter
has
two effects.|420797005|253861007

It
allows
water|11713004|119318008
to flow more freely
and
it
reduces|260400001
the oncotic pressure difference|49361002|263735002
by allowing protein to|88878007
leave|7771000|90737002
the vessel more easily.|59820001|36203004

Edema|423666004
in plants|31006001
is
the extended swelling in plant organs|255536004|423666004|31006001|410653004|255536004|442672001|31006001|410653004|288467006|423666004|31006001|410653004|288467006|442672001|31006001|410653004|255590007|423666004|31006001|410653004|255590007|442672001|31006001|410653004
caused|23981006|134198009
primarily
by an excessive accumulation|260378005
of water,|11713004|119318008
a condition|260905004
most
damaging|37782003
in Cacti,|107542007
Fuchsias,
Pelargonium|23047002
and
Succulents.

The excess absorption|260378005
of water|11713004|119318008
can
cause|23981006|134198009
cells to|4421005
rupture|415747007
,
partly
due to the cell walls|4421005|224727009|362837007|224727009
