(also
known|36692007
as "Cave disease,|285067000|64572001

"[1] "Spelunker?s Lung"|39607008|181216001
and
Caver's disease|64572001
)
is
a disease|64572001
caused|23981006|134198009
by the fungus _Histoplasma capsulatum_.|414561005|62969002|414561005|56596006

Symptoms
of this infection
vary
greatly,
but
the disease primarily|64572001
affects|4065008
the lungs.|39607008

Occasionally,
other organs|74964007|410653004
are
affected|247591002|248448006
;
this
is
called disseminated histoplasmosis,
and
it
can
be
fatal|399166001
if
left|7771000
untreated.|25265005

Histoplasmosis|12962009
is
common|72906007
among AIDS patients|62479008|116154003
because of their suppressed immune system.|245780008|116003000

Histoplasmosis|12962009
is
generally
contracted|78558002
from contact|11723008|70862002
to microscopic fungi|84496004|414561005
borne|106970005|81827009|398209006
from decomposing biological fluids,|12893009|32457005|12893009|33463005
most notably human excretions|278412004|63911002
like urine,|78014005
vomit,|249497008|1985008
and
feces.|39477002

Cases|398241000|413769002
of histoplasmosis|12962009
have
declined
acutely
since
the Industrial Revolution|257875004
as quality|263496004
of life|224130005
improved|385425000|3442003
dramatically
and
humans|278412004
were
no longer living|255511005|224130005|255511005|419749002
in their own squalor.

Unfortunately,
it
is
still
a major killer|255603008
in third world countries|70905002|223369002
and
can
be
contracted|78558002
easily|36203004
in the first world|255216001|232714002
by living
among the aforementioned human fluids.|278412004|32457005|278412004|33463005

If symptoms
of histoplasmosis infection|12962009
occur|272120004
,
they
will
start|255395001
within 3|260313008
to 17 days|258703001
after exposure|71677004|24932003
;
the average
is
12?14 days.|258703001

Most affected individuals|247591002|125676002|247591002|385435006|248448006|125676002|248448006|385435006
have
clinically silent manifestations|263872000|250255003|263872000|251190009
and
show
no apparent ill effects.|367391008|253861007

The acute phase|255251009
of histoplasmosis|12962009
is
characterized
by non-specific respiratory symptoms,|10003008|161920001
often|70232002
cough|272039006
or
flu-like.|6142004

Chest X-ray findings|399208008|404684003|399208008
are
normal|17621005|258744000
in 40?70%|259031006
of cases.|398241000|413769002

Chronic histoplasmosis cases|90734009|12962009|398241000|90734009|12962009|413769002
can
resemble
tuberculosis|371569005
;[5][6] disseminated histoplasmosis|260271001
affects|4065008
multiple organ systems|260396001|91689009
and
is
fatal|399166001
unless
treated.[7]|28995006

While
histoplasmosis|12962009
is
the most common cause|4757001|72906007|134198009
of mediastinitis,|47597000
this
remains
a relatively rare disease.|84638005|64572001|103356009|64572001

Severe infections|24484000
can
cause|23981006|134198009
hepatosplenomegaly,|36760000
lymphadenopathy,|111590001|30746006
and
adrenal enlargement.|23451007|56246009|23451007|118452000|23451007|442021009

Lesions
have
a tendency to
calcify
as
they
heal.|298005009

the retina|5665001|181171005
of the eyes.|81745001

Scar tissue|70582006|275322007
is
left|7771000
on the retina|5665001|181171005
which
can
experience
leakage,|76676007
resulting|42752001
in a loss
of vision|281004000
not
unlike macular degeneration._[citation|422338006|267718000

Histoplasmosis|12962009
may
be
divided|422033008
into the following types|255260001|261664005
:
[8]
:
316-317

_Histoplasma capsulatum_|62969002|56596006
is
found|404684003
throughout the world.

It
is
endemic
in certain areas|17162000|42798000
of the United States,|223688001
particularly
in states|398070004
bordering|112233002
the Ohio River valley|420391008|420531007|285098003
and
the lower Mississippi River.|261122009|224069001|420531007

It
is
also common|72906007
in caves|285067000
in southern
and
East Africa.|223498002

Positive histoplasmin skin tests|258758003|54352009|53309004|10828004|54352009|53309004
occur|272120004
in
as
many
as 90%|264705001|264703008
of the people|125676002
living|224130005|419749002
in areas|42798000
where _H.|89177007|258322007|286551008

capsulatum_
is
common,|72906007
such as the eastern
and
central United States.[2]|26216008|223688001

_H.|89177007|258322007|286551008

capsulatum_
grows
in soil|415555003
and
material|260769002
contaminated|62604006
with bird|387972009
or
bat droppings|388074005|272168005
(guano.

The fungus|414561005
has
been
found|404684003
in poultry house litter,|359839008|261770009|370553007|359839008|257630004|370553007|28230009|261770009|370553007|28230009|257630004|370553007
caves,|285067000
areas|42798000
harboring|257621007
bats,|388074005
and
in bird roosts|387972009
(particularly
those
of starlings.|396725005|107199006

The fungus|414561005
is
thermally dimorphic|58354000
:
in the environment|276339004
it
grows
as a brownish mycelium,|284689008
and
at body temperature|105723007
(37 ?C
in humans|278412004
)
it morphs|373529000|116676008
into a yeast.|58296003|412534006|411818003

The inoculum
is
represented principally
by microconidia|65180005
that,
once
inhaled|14910006
into the alveolar spaces,
germinate
and
then
transform
into budding yeast cells.|426013006|4421005

Histoplasmosis|12962009
is
not contagious,
but
is
contracted|78558002
by inhalation|14910006|422237004
of the spores|263883009
from disturbed soil|415555003
or
guano.[2]

Histoplasmosis|12962009
can
be
diagnosed|439401001
by samples|123038009
containing|42504009
the fungusken
from sputum,|45710003
blood,|87612001|119273009
or
infected organs.|410653004

It
can
also
be
diagnosed|439401001
by detection
of antigens|7120007
in blood|87612001|119273009
or
urine samples|122575003
by ELISA|76978006
or
PCR.|258066000|103338009

It
can
also
be
diagnosed|439401001
by a test|269814003|272393004
for antibodies|68498002
against _Histoplasma_|81951003
in the blood.|87612001|119273009

_Histoplasma_ skin tests|62123003
indicate|410535002
whether
a person|125676002
has
been
exposed|24932003
,
but
do
not
indicate|410535002
whether
they
have
the disease.|64572001

Formal histoplasmosis diagnoses|246176004|12962009|439401001
are
often|70232002
confirmed only|59156000
by culturing|252398009|61594008
the fungus directly.|414561005

Cutaneous manifestations|119325001|250255003|119325001|251190009|39937001|250255003|39937001|251190009|181469002|250255003|181469002|251190009
of disseminated disease|65709003|64572001
are
diverse
and
often|70232002
present|52101004|246105001
as a nondescript rash|271807003
with systemic complaints.|31099001|409586006

Diagnosis|439401001
is
best|20572008|3442003
established|263748003|385645004
by urine antigen testing.|78014005|312504002

Blood cultures|30088009
may
take up|419652001|255532002|419652001|353734004
to 6 weeks|258705008
for diagnostic growth to|439401001|261004008
occur|272120004
and
serum antigen|67922002|7120007
testing|272393004
often|70232002
comes
back
with a false negative|61707005
before 4 weeks|260308009|258705008
of disseminated infection.[9]|65709003

It
is
not practical to
test|269814003|272393004
or
decontaminate|409530006
most sites|10546003
that
may
be
contaminated|62604006
with _H.|89177007|258322007|286551008

capsulatum_,
but
the following sources|255260001|260753009
list
environments|276339004
where histoplasmosis|12962009
is
common,|72906007
and
precautions to
reduce|260400001
a person's risk|125676002|30207005
of exposure,|71677004|24932003
in the three parts|421291004|260726005
of the world
where the disease|64572001
is
prevalent.

Precautions
common|72906007
to all geographical locations|246267002
would
be
to
avoid
accumulations
of bird|387972009
or
bat droppings.|388074005|272168005

Antifungal medications|373219008|410942007
are
used|394850002
to
treat|395077000
severe cases|24484000|398241000|24484000|413769002
of acute histoplasmosis|272118002|12962009
and
all cases|398241000|413769002
of chronic|90734009
and
disseminated disease.|65709003|64572001

Typical treatment|276239002|416118004
of severe disease first|24484000|64572001|255216001|24484000|64572001|232714002
involves|248448006
treatment|276239002|416118004
with amphotericin B,|77703004
followed|367409002
by oral itraconazole.|260548002|387532006

Treatment|276239002|416118004
with itraconazole|387532006
will
need|410525008|103325001
to
continue|255238004
for
at least
a year|258707000|259039008
in severe cases.[14]|24484000|398241000|24484000|413769002

In many milder cases,|255604002|398241000|255604002|413769002
oral itraconazole|260548002|387532006
or
ketoconazole|387216007
is
sufficient.|51117008

Asymptomatic disease|84387000|64572001
is
typically
not
treated.|28995006

Past infection|410513005
results|394617004
in partial protection|255609007
against ill effects|367391008|253861007
if
reinfected.|255230006

_Histoplasma_|81951003
was
discovered
in 1905
by Darling,
[15]
but
was
only
discovered to
be
a widespread infection|85333001
in the 1930s.

Before then,|236874000|421718005
many cases|398241000|413769002
of histoplasmosis|12962009
were
mistakenly
attributed|246061005
to tuberculosis,|371569005
and
patients|116154003
were
mistakenly
admitted|32485007
to tuberculosis sanatoriums.|371569005

Some patients|116154003
contracted|78558002
tuberculosis|371569005
in these sanatoriums
(reference
:
Mandell,
Bennett
and
Dolin
).
