*Polymyalgia rheumatica|65323003|414341000
*
*
(
which
takes|419652001
its name
from the word "polymyalgia"|255373000|95415006
which means "pain|255586005|22253000
in many muscles"|91727004
in Greek|1451003
followed|367409002
by the term "rheumatica"
)
abbreviated
as
*
*PMR|65323003
*
*,
is
a syndrome
with pain|22253000
or
stiffness,|271587009
usually
in the neck,|45048000|302550007
shoulders,|16982005
and
hips.|29836001

The pain|22253000
can
be
very sudden,|260358002|255363002
or
can
occur|272120004
gradually
over a period.|259037005

It
may
be
caused|23981006|134198009
by an inflammatory condition|260905004
of blood vessels.|59820001

Most PMR sufferers wake up|65323003|255377004|255532002|65323003|255377004|353734004|65323003|307156004|255532002|65323003|307156004|353734004
in the morning|73775008
with pain|22253000
in their muscles|91727004
;
however,
there
have
been
cases|398241000|413769002
in which
the patient|116154003
has
developed
the pain|22253000
during the evenings.|3157002

Patients|116154003
who
have
polymyalgia rheumatica|65323003|414341000
may
also
have
temporal arteritis,|400130008
a potentially dangerous inflammation|257552002
of blood vessels|59820001
in the face.|89545001|302549007

PMR|65323003
is
usually
treated|28995006
with courses|288524001
of oral corticosteroids.|260548002|79440004

Most people|125676002
need|410525008|103325001
to
continue|255238004
the corticosteroid treatment|79440004|276239002|79440004|416118004
for two|420797005
to three years.|421291004|258707000

PMR usually|65323003
goes
away
on its own
in a year|258707000|259039008
or
two,|420797005
but
medications|410942007
and
self-care measures|384758001|246445000|384758001|367346004
can
improve|385425000|3442003|385633008
the rate
of recovery.[4]

There
are
a wide range|90522003
of symptoms
that
indicate|410535002
if
a person|125676002
has
polymyalgia rheumatica.|65323003|414341000

The classic symptoms|255301002|255333006
include|55919000
:

Studies|110465008|224699009
have
shown
that
about 15%
of people|125676002
who
are
diagnosed|439401001
with polymyalgia rheumatica also|65323003|414341000
have
temporal arteritis,|400130008
and
about 50%
of people|125676002
with temporal arteritis|400130008
have
polymyalgia rheumatica.|65323003|414341000

Some symptoms
of temporal arteritis|400130008
include|55919000
severe headaches,|24484000|25064002
scalp tenderness,|75851004
jaw|661005|181811001
or
facial soreness,|89545001|247348008
distorted vision|281004000
or
aching|410711009
in the limbs|66019005
caused|23981006|134198009
by decreased blood flow,|21762000
and
fatigue.[1]|84229001

The cause|134198009
of PMR|65323003
is
not well understood.|20572008|66216009

The pain|22253000
and
stiffness result|271587009|394617004
from the activity|48761009|55561003|258745004|257733005
of inflammatory cells|256923004
and
proteins|88878007
that
are
normally
a part|260726005
of the body's disease-|279495008|64572001|123037004|64572001
fighting|248005005
immune system,|116003000
and
the inflammatory activity|48761009|55561003|258745004|257733005
seems
to
be
concentrated
in tissues|85756007
surrounding|355648006
the affected joints.|247591002|39352004|247591002|81087007|248448006|39352004|248448006|81087007

During this disorder,|64572001
the white blood cells|767002|52501007
in the body|279495008|123037004
attack|217315002|216299002
the lining|50009006
of the joints,|39352004|81087007
causing|23981006
inflammation.|257552002

Recent studies|6493001|110465008|6493001|224699009
have
found|404684003
that inherited factors also|255404009
play|300776002
a role
in the probability|2931005
that
an individual|125676002|385435006
will
develop
polymyalgia rheumatica.|65323003|414341000

Several theories|261028005
have
included viral stimulation|55919000|122545008
of the immune system|116003000
in genetically susceptible individuals.[8]|131196009|125676002|131196009|385435006

Infectious disease|191415002
may
be
a contributing factor.

This
would
be
expected
with sudden onset|385315009|255363002
of symptoms
for example.

In addition,|260364009
appearance|386548000|255412001
of new cases often|7147002|398241000|70232002|7147002|413769002|70232002
appear
in cycles|44180009
in the general population,|60132005|385436007|60132005|389109008
implying
a viral connection.|263538003

Studies|110465008|224699009
are
inconclusive, however several somewhat common viruses|419984006|72906007|49872002
were
identified|7882003
as possible triggers|371930009|60022001
for PMR.|65323003

The viruses|49872002
thought|88952004
to
be
involved|248448006
include|55919000
the adenovirus,|424470006|25225006
which
causes|134198009
respiratory infections|275498002
;
the human parvovirus B19,|63603005
an infection
that
affects|4065008
children|410601007|160499008
;
and
the human parainfluenza virus.[7]|407498006

People|125676002
who
have
the HLA-DR4 type|168474008
of human leucocyte antigen|47038001
appear
to
have
a higher risk|15508007
of polymyalgia rheumatica.[9]|65323003|414341000

One reported cause|421379005|229059009|134198009|421379005|223458004|134198009
is
food sensitivities.|418471000

Sufferers often|70232002
do
not
know|36692007
they
are
affected|247591002|248448006
by them,
but
medical tests|74188005|269814003|74188005|272393004
exist
to
verify.

There
is
no specific test to|69658003|269814003|69658003|69658003|272393004
diagnose|439401001
polymyalgia rheumatica.|65323003|414341000

There
are
many other diseases|260396001|64572001
which
cause|23981006|134198009
inflammation|257552002
and
pain|22253000
in muscles,|91727004
but
there
are
a few tests|57176003|269814003|57176003|272393004
that
can
help
narrow|18043004|25659002|134223000
down the cause|134198009
of the pain.|22253000

Limitation|246175000
in shoulder motion,|16982005|56219004|361103004|56219004
or
swelling|423666004|442672001
of the joints|39352004|81087007
in the wrists|8205005
or
hands|85562004
are
noted
by the doctor.|309343006

A patient's|116154003
answers
to questions,|42425007
a general physical exam,|60132005|5880005
and
the results of tests|394617004|269814003|394617004|272393004
can
help
a doctor|309343006
determine
the cause|134198009
of pain|22253000
and
stiffness.[10]|271587009

One blood test|421379005|252275004|421379005
that
is
usually
performed|398166005
is
the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR)|416838001|365649001
which
measures|246445000|367346004
how fast|16985007|277748003
the patient's red blood cells|116154003|14089001|116154003|41898006|116154003|258759006|116154003|126242007
settle|128719006
in a test tube.|337386000

The faster|16985007|277748003
the blood cells|63370004
settle|128719006
,
the higher|75540009|371879000
the ESR value,
which means|255586005
that there
is
inflammation.|257552002

Many conditions|260396001|260905004
can
cause|23981006|134198009
an elevated ESR,|75540009
so
this test|269814003|272393004
alone|105529008
is
not proof|229796008
that
a person|125676002
has
polymyalgia rheumatica.[10][11]|65323003|414341000

Another
test|269814003|272393004
that
checks|360160009
the level|258395000|276625007
of C-reactive protein (CRP)|61425002|55235003
in the blood|87612001|119273009
may
also
be
conducted.|844005

CRP|128200000
is
produced
by the liver|10200004|181268008
in response
to an injury
or
infection
and
people|125676002
with polymyalgia rheumatica usually|65323003|414341000
have
high levels.|75540009|258395000|371879000|258395000

However,
like the ESR,
this test|269814003|272393004
is
also very non-specific.|260358002|10003008

Polymyalgia rheumatica|65323003|414341000
is
sometimes
associated|47429007
with temporal arteritis,|400130008
a condition|260905004
requiring
more aggressive therapy.|242762006|61372001|276239002|242762006|276239002

To
test|269814003|272393004
for this additional disorder,|260364009|64572001
a biopsy sample|258415003
may
be
taken|419652001
of the temporal artery.[10]|255570003|51114001|255570003|11527006

Prednisone|116602009
is
the drug|410942007
of choice
for PMR[12]|65323003
and
treatment duration|261774000
is
frequently greater|70232002|263768009
than one year.|421379005|258707000|421379005|259039008

If
the patient|116154003
does
not
experience
dramatic improvement
after three days|421291004|258703001
of 10?20 mg oral prednisone|427264006|260548002|116602009
per day,|258703001|259032004
the diagnosis|439401001
should
be
reconsidered.[13]

Non steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)|372665008
such as ibuprofen|387207008
are
ineffective
in the initial treatment|884001|276239002|884001|416118004|232714002|276239002|232714002|416118004
of PMR,|65323003
[14]
but
they
may
be
used|394850002
in conjunction with the maintenance dose|277406006|408102007
of corticosteroid.[15]|79440004

Along
with medical treatment,|74188005|276239002|74188005|416118004
patients|116154003
are
encouraged
to
exercise|61686008
and
eat healthily.|48263008

Exercise|61686008
will
help
strengthen
the weak muscles,|26544005
and
help
to
prevent
weight gain.|262286000

A healthy diet|226234005
will
help
to
keep
a strong immune system,|260404005|116003000
and
also
help
build strong muscles|260404005|91727004
and
bones.|272673000|128530007

Eat|48263008
a diet|41829006
of fruits,|72511004
vegetables,|22836000
whole grains,|260232004|23182003|260232004|264331002
and
low-fat meat|62482003|271590003|28647000|371880002|271590003|28647000
and
dairy products.|226760005

Avoid
foods|255620007
with high levels|75540009|258395000|371879000|258395000
of refined sugars|74801000
and
salt|387390002
(sodium|39972003
).[17]

There
are
no certain circumstances|17162000
for which
an individual|125676002|385435006
will
get
polymyalgia rheumatica,|65323003|414341000
but
there
are
a few factors|57176003
that
show
a relationship|272151006
with the disorder.|64572001
