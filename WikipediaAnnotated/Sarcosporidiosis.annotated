_Sarcocystis accipitris_|34666003

*
*Sarcocystis|34666003
*
*
is
a genus|18511007
of protozoa.|417396000

Species|69658003
in this genus|18511007
are
parasites,|37763007
the majority infecting mammals,|387976007
and
some infecting reptiles|107241004
and
birds.|387972009

The life-cycle|224130005|44180009
of a typical member|394852005
of this genus|18511007
involves|248448006
two host species,|420797005|69658003
a definitive host|261002007
and
an intermediate host.|11896004

Often|70232002
the definitive host|261002007
is
a predator
and
the intermediate host|11896004
is
its prey.

The parasite|37763007
reproduces
sexually|365952006
in the gut|122865005
of the definitive host,|261002007
is
passed
with the feces|39477002
and
ingested|111984006
by the intermediate host.|11896004

There
it eventually
enters|417985001
muscle tissue.|91727004

When
the intermediate host|11896004
is
eaten|48263008
by the definitive host,|261002007
the cycle|44180009
is
completed.|255594003

The definitive host usually|261002007
does
not
show
any symptoms
of infection,
but
the intermediate host|11896004
does.

There
are
about 130 recognised species|69658003
in this genus.|18511007

Revision|255231005|118635009|261560009
of the taxonomy
of the genus|18511007
is
ongoing,|255238004
and
it
is
possible|371930009|60022001
that
all the currently recognised species|15240007|69658003
may
in fact
be
a much smaller number|242762006|263796003|410680006|242762006|263796003|410681005|242762006|255507004|410680006|242762006|255507004|410681005|4757001|263796003|410680006|4757001|263796003|410681005|4757001|255507004|410680006|4757001|255507004|410681005
of species|69658003
that
can
infect
multiple hosts.|260396001

The name _Sarcocystis_|34666003
is
dervived
from Greek|1451003
:
_sarx_
= flesh
and
_kystis_
= bladder.|89837001|302512001

The organism|410653004
was
first|255216001|232714002
recognised
in a mouse|447612001|447482001
by Miescher
in 1843.

His findings|404684003
were
not
recognised
as a protist initially|884001
and
the literature
referred|439980006
to the structures
he
described
as "Miescher's Tubules".|95568003|13336003

Incidentally Miescher's son ? Johann Friedrich Miescher ? discovered DNA.|65616008|24851008

Similar structures
were
found|404684003
in pig muscle|78678003|91727004|388393002|91727004|388392007|91727004
in 1865
but
these remained unnamed
until 1899
when
the name _Sarcocystis meischeriana_|34666003
was
proposed
to
identify|7882003
them.

Initially|884001
it
was
unclear
whether
these organisms|410653004
were
fungi|414561005
or
protozoa.|417396000

This uncertainty|64957009
was
resolved
in 1967
when
electron microscopic studies|73512001
showed
that
these organism|410653004
were
protozoa|417396000
related|272151006|262094002
to _Toxoplasma_|61949005
and
_Eimeria_.|16157006

The life cycle|224130005|44180009
remained
unknown|261665006
until 1970
when
bradyzoites
from sarcocysts
in bird muscles|387972009|91727004
were
inoculated
into cultured mammalian cells|252398009|387976007|4421005|61594008|387976007|4421005
and
underwent development|278923009
into sexual stages|365952006|261612004
and
oocysts.|103541004

Transmission|258150004
studies|110465008|224699009
with the three morphotypes|421291004
found|404684003
in cattle then
considered
a single species - _Sarcoplasma fusiformis_ -|125681006|69658003|50607009|69658003
in dogs,|448771007
cats|448169003|388618001
and
humans|278412004
revealed|263857004
that
these
were
three different species now|421291004|263735002|69658003
named|27468005
_Sarcoplasma bovicanis_,
_Sarcoplasma bovifelis_
and
_Sarcoplasma bovihominis_.

The heteroxenous
(more|242762006
than one obligatory host|421379005
in its life cycle|224130005|44180009
)
life cycle|224130005|44180009
of these apicomplexan parasites|37763007
remained
obscure
until 1972
when
the prey-predator relationship|272151006
of its definitive|261002007
and
intermediate hosts|11896004
was
recognised.

The life cycles|224130005|44180009
of about 60
of these species|69658003
is
now
known.|36692007

In outline gametogony
and
sporogony
occur|272120004
in the intestine|261093006
of the definitive host|261002007
while
both
schizogony
which
occurs|272120004
in various tissues|256220008|85756007
and
the formation|11798007|255277001
of sarcocysts
(containing bradyzoites|42504009
and
metrocytes
occurs|272120004
prinicpally
in the muscles|91727004
of the intermediate host.|11896004

In some cases|398241000|413769002
a single species|125681006|69658003|50607009|69658003
may
act
as both
the definitive|261002007
and
intermediate host.|11896004

Oocysts|103541004
are
passed
in the feces|39477002
of an infected definitive host.|261002007

The oocyst|103541004
undergoes
sporogony
creating
two sporocysts.|420797005|264574003

Once this
is
complete|255594003
the oocyst|103541004
itself
undergoes
lysis|371757000|239551005
releasing|129299003
the sporocysts|264574003
into the environment.|276339004

Sporocysts typically|264574003
contain|42504009
4 sporozoites|260308009|103545008
and
measure 15-19|246445000|272391002
by 8-10 micrometres.|258674000

An intermediate host|11896004
such as a cow|34618005
or
pig then|78678003|388393002|388392007
ingests|111984006
a sporocyst.|264574003

Sporozoites|103545008
are
then
released|68776005|129299003
in the body|279495008|123037004
and
migrate
to vessels|59820001
where they
undergo
the first two generation|255216001|420797005|232714002|420797005
of asexual reproduction.|263767004

These rounds|42700002
result|394617004
in the development|278923009
of meronts.|103544007

This stage lasts|21191007|371508000|261612004
about 15
to 16 days|258703001
after ingestion|111984006
of sporocysts.|264574003

Merozoites|103543001
emerge
from the second generation meronts|81170007|103544007|257997001|103544007|288495006|103544007
and
enter|417985001
the mononucleate cells|4421005
where they
develop
by endodyogeny.

Subsequent generations|255260001
of merozoites|103543001
develop
downstream|103365002
in the direction|260672003
of blood flow|58190003
to arterioles,|28225005
capillaries,|20982000
venules,|57766006
and
veins|29092000
throughout the body subsequently|279495008|123037004
developing
into the final asexual generation|42796001
in muscles.|91727004

Merozoites|103543001
entering|417985001
muscle cells round up|91727004|4421005|42700002|255532002|91727004|4421005|42700002|353734004
to form metrocytes|246176004
and
initiate
sarcocyst formation.|11798007|255277001

Sarcocysts
begin|255395001
as unicellular bodies|279495008|123037004
containing|42504009
a single metrocyte|125681006|50607009
and
through asexual multiplication numerous metrocytes|260396001
accumulate
and
the sarcocyst increases|260366006
in size.|277049003

As the sarcocyst matures,|34071009
the small, rounded,|255507004|42700002
noninfectious metrocytes
give|419582001
rise
to crescent-shaped bodies|264296008|107644003|279495008|264296008|107644003|123037004|264296008|300842002|279495008|264296008|300842002|123037004
called
bradyzoites
that
are
infections
for the definitive host.|261002007

Time|410669006
required
for maturation
varies
with the species|69658003
and
may
take|419652001
2 months|260306008|258706009
or
more.|242762006

In species|69658003
in which symptoms
develop
these typically
occur|272120004
20?40 days|259031006|258703001
after ingestion|111984006
of sporocysts|264574003
and
during the subsequent migration|255260001|74118003
of sporozoites|103545008
through the body vessels.|279495008|59820001|123037004|59820001

Acute lesions|272118002
(oedema,|423666004
hemorrhages|131148009
and
necrosis|6574001
)
develop
in the affected tissues.|247591002|85756007|248448006|85756007

The parasite|37763007
has
a predilection
for skeletal muscle|127954009|244716004
(myositis|26889001
)
,
cardiac muscle|74281007
(petechial hemorrhages|423716004
of cardiac muscle|74281007
and
serosae|75858005
)
,
and
lymph nodes|59441001
(oedema,|423666004
necrosis|6574001
and
hemorrhage|131148009
).

These lesions
are
associated|47429007
with maturation
of second generation|81170007|257997001|288495006
of meronts|103544007
within the endothelial|27168002
and
subendothelials cells.|4421005

Occasionally mononuclear infiltration|47351003|231287002
or
hyperemia|30098003
has
been
observed
in the lamina propria|88446008
of the small intestine.|264196002|181250005

After the acute phase cysts|255251009|441457006
may
be
found|404684003
in various muscular tissues,|256220008|91727004
generally
without pathology.|394595002

Once the intermediate host|11896004
is
eaten|48263008
by the definitive host|261002007
such as a dog|448771007
or
human,|278412004
the parasite|37763007
undergoes
sexual reproduction|365952006|263767004
within the gut to|122865005
create
macrogamonts
and
microgamonts.

Most definitive hosts|4757001|261002007
do
not
show
any clinical sign|58147004|72670004
or
symptoms.

Fusion|31883006|122501008
of a macrogamont
and
a microgamont
creates
a zygote|57323001|103540003
which
develops
into an oocyst.|103541004

The oocyst|103541004
is
passed
through the faeces|39477002
completing|255594003
the life cycle.|224130005|44180009

A second life cycle|81170007|224130005|44180009|257997001|224130005|44180009|288495006|224130005|44180009
has
more recently|242762006|6493001
been
described
whereby
carnivores|388071002
and
omnivores|284731009
pass
the infectious stages|261612004
in their faeces.|39477002

Ingestion|111984006
of this material|260769002
may
lead|88488004
to successful infection|385669000
of the ingesting animal.|111984006|387961004

Although
sarcocysts
were
first|255216001|232714002
reported|229059009|223458004
in the muscles|91727004
of birds|387972009
by Kuhn
in 1865
not
until 1977
was
the first life cycle|255216001|224130005|44180009|232714002|224130005|44180009
involving|248448006
a bird|387972009
(_Gallus gallus_|409910000
)
and
a carnivore|284729000
(_Canis familiaris_|448771007
)
described
by Munday
et
al.

In 1986
the first life cycle|255216001|224130005|44180009|232714002|224130005|44180009
involving|248448006
birds|387972009
as
both the definitive|261002007
(_Northern Goshawk_|229004
)
and
intermediate|11896004
(_Serinus canaria_|396524007
)
hosts
was
described
by Cern
and
Kvasnovsk.[3]

The taxonomy
of this genus|18511007
and
its relationship|272151006
to other protozoal genera|74964007|417396000|18511007
is
currently|15240007
under investigation.|386053000

Related genera|272151006|18511007|262094002|18511007
include|55919000
:
_Besnoitia_,|8650001
_Caryospora_,|41929005
_Cystoisospora_,|3576009
_Frenkelia_,|77904001
_Isospora_,|26704001
_Hammondia_,|78958008
_Hyaloklossia_,
_Lankesterella_,|76153008
_Neospora_|372928009
and
_Toxoplasma_.|61949005

_Sarcocystis_|34666003
is
the largest genus|255509001|18511007|263768009|18511007
within the family _Sarcocystidae_|106612008
and
consists
of species|69658003
which
infecting
a range
of animals|387961004
including|55919000
mammals,|387976007
birds|387972009
and
reptiles.|107241004

_Frenkelia_,|77904001
another genus|18511007
within this family,|35359004
consists
of parasites|37763007
that
use|277889008|419385000
rodents|388077003
as intermediate hosts|11896004
and
birds|387972009
of prey
as definitive hosts.|261002007

It
appears
that _Besnoitia_,|8650001
_Hammondia_,|78958008
_Neospora_|372928009
and
_Toxoplasma_|61949005
form|246176004
a single clade.|125681006|50607009

Within this clade _Toxoplasma_|61949005
and
_Neospora_|372928009
appear
to
be
sister clades.|27733009

_Isospora_ also|26704001
appear
to
belong
to this clade
and
this clade
is
a sister|27733009
to _Sarcocystis_.|34666003

_Frenkelia_|77904001
appears
to
be
very closely|260358002
related|272151006|262094002
to _Sarcocystis_.|34666003

Several molecular studies|261028005|290005005|110465008|261028005|290005005|224699009
have
suggested
that _Frenkelia_|77904001
is
actually
a species|69658003
of _Sarcocystis_.|34666003

This genus|18511007
was
distinguished
from _Sarcocystis_|34666003
on the basis|418836005
of its tendency
to encyst|255283003
within the brain|12738006|258335003
rather than
within muscle.|91727004

This distinction
may
not
be
taxonomically valid.

Within the genus|18511007
a number|410680006|410681005
of clades
have
been
identified.|7882003

These
include|55919000
one|421379005
that
contains|42504009
_S.|288495006

dispersa_,
_S.|288495006

lacertae_,
_S.|288495006

mucosa_,|313268005
_S.|288495006

muris_,
_S.|288495006

neurona_ and _S.

rodentifelis_.

_Frenkelia_ also|77904001
groups|261586004|160481000
with this clade.

These protozoa|417396000
are
mostly
found|404684003
in mammals.|387976007

They
do
not
appear
to
infect
mammals|387976007
of the superorder Afrotheria
and
infect
only two species|50607009|420797005|69658003|420295001|420797005|69658003
of the Xenarthra.

Because of this
pattern|272135003
the genus|18511007
may
have
evolved|59381007
in the Northern hemisphere
from a preexisting protozoan species|417396000|69658003
that infected mammals.|387976007

Alternatively
because
a number|410680006|410681005
of Australian marsupials|388007002
are
also
infected
by this genus,|18511007
marsupials|388007002
may
have
been
the original hosts|19535007
of this genus|18511007
and
the parasites|37763007
were
spread|410677005
to the Northern hemisphere
by birds.|387972009

A third possibility|70905002
is
that
the genus originally infected birds|18511007|387972009
and
was
spread|410677005
world wide|90522003
by these hosts.

A final possibility|42796001
because of the existence
of life cycles|224130005|44180009
where
both
the intermediate|11896004
and
final hosts|42796001
are
reptiles,|107241004
the genus|18511007
may
have
originated
in reptiles|107241004
and
spread|410677005
from there
to other genera.|74964007|18511007

The resolution
of this question|42425007
awaits
the outcome|394617004
of further molecular studies.|46053002|290005005|110465008|46053002|290005005|224699009

Infection
with this parasite|37763007
is
known|36692007
as sarcosporidiosis.|88905005

Because of initial confusion|884001|286933003|232714002|286933003
over the taxonomy
of this parasite|37763007
it
was
originally
referred|439980006
to
as
_Isospora hominis_.|9037008

The older literature|70753007
may
refer|439980006
to this organism.|410653004

Human infection|278412004
is
considered rare|84638005|103356009
with less|276139006|263796003
than one|421379005
hundred
published cases|398241000|413769002
of invasive disease|10179008|64572001
(approximately 46 cases|26175008|398241000|26175008|413769002
reported|229059009|223458004
by 1990
).

These figure
represent
a gross underestimate|255344003
of the human burden|278412004
of disease.|64572001

The extremes|12565001
of age|424144002
reported|229059009|223458004
to date|410671006
are
a 26-day-old infant|258703001|70753007|418119000|259032004|70753007|418119000
and
a 75-year-old man.|258707000|70753007|248153007|258707000|70753007|339947000|258707000|70753007|278412004|259039008|70753007|248153007|259039008|70753007|339947000|259039008|70753007|278412004

Infectons
have
been
reported|229059009|223458004
from Africa,|223498002
Europe|223502009
(Germany,|223637004
Spain|223680008
and
Poland,|223640004
the United States|223688001
(California,|224043007|25997004

and
South America,|223504005
China,|223581004
India,|223600005
Tibet,
Malaysia|223591005
and
Southeast Asia.|223585008

Stool examinations|39477002|5880005
in Thai laborers|83365001|106540006
showed
that sarcocystis infection|34666003
had
a prevalence
of ~23%.|264657009

Virtually
all cases|398241000|413769002
appeared
to
be
asymptomatic|84387000
which probably
explains
the lack|41277001
of recognition.|312020002

A study|110465008|224699009
of 100 human tongues|278412004|21974007
obtained|398092000
at
post mortum
in Malaya|223591005|262431004
revealed|263857004
an infection rate
of 21%.

There
was
no sex difference|258139002|263735002|365952006|263735002|263495000|263735002|70256003|263735002|57312000|263735002
and
the age range|424144002
was
16
to 57 years|258707000
(mean 37.7 years|255586005|258707000
).[5]|264706000|264605009

The first report|255216001|229059009|255216001|223458004|232714002|229059009|232714002|223458004
of human infection|278412004
was
by Lindemannl
in 1868.

Although
several additional reports|261028005|260364009|229059009|261028005|260364009|223458004
were
subsequently
published
,
these early descriptions|264499004
were
not
considered
definitive.|261002007

The first generally|255216001|232714002
agreed
definitive description|261002007
of this disease|64572001
was
published
in 1894
by Baraban
and
Saint-Remy.

This species|69658003
was
named|27468005
by Rivolta
after Lindemannl
in 1898.

The invasive forms|10179008|246176004
were
considered
to
belong
to a single species - _S.|125681006|69658003|50607009|69658003

lindemanni_ -
and
the intestinal form|261093006|246176004
due to _S.|288495006

hominis_|229939007
(
from undercooked beef|226916002
)
or _S.

suihominis_
(
from undercooked pork|226934003
).

The description of _S.

lindemanni_
has
since
been
considered
to
be
unsatisfactory|255370002
and
has
been
declared
a _nomem nudum_
(
a name
without a recognised species|69658003
).

Two species currently|420797005|69658003|15240007
considered
to
be
capable
of causing human infection|23981006|278412004
:
_S.|288495006

bovihominis_
(_S.|288495006

hominis_|229939007
)
and _S.

suihominis_.

Infection
occurs|272120004
when
undercooked meat|28647000
is
ingested.|111984006

The incubation period|406646006
is
9?39 days.|258703001

Human outbreaks|278412004|443684005
have
occurred|272120004
in Europe.|223502009

Rats|371565004|371564000
are
a known carrier.|36692007|47461006|36692007|29679002

It
has
been
suggested
that contaminated water|102414000
may
be
able to|371150009
cause|23981006|134198009
infection
but
this presently
remains
a theoretical possibility.

The pathology|394595002
is
of two types|420797005|261664005
:
a rare invasive form|84638005|10179008|246176004|103356009|10179008|246176004
with vasculitis|31996006
and
myositis|26889001
and
an intestinal form|261093006|246176004
that
presents|52101004|246105001
with nausea,|422587007
abdominal pain,|21522001
and
diarrhea.|398032003

While
normally mild|255604002
and
lasting
under 48 hours,|255249005
the intestinal form|261093006|246176004
may
occasionally
be
severe|24484000
or
even life threatening.|224130005

The invasive form|10179008|246176004
may
involve|248448006
a wide variety|90522003
of tissues|85756007
including|55919000
lymph nodes,|59441001
muscles|91727004
and
the larynx.|261115001|181212004

In volunteer|160772005|428024001
studies|110465008|224699009
with infected beef symptoms|226916002
appeared
3?6 hours|260281002|258702006
after eating.|48263008

These included anorexia,|55919000
nausea,|422587007
abdominal pain,|21522001
distension,|25322007
diarrhea,|398032003
vomiting|249497008
,
dyspnoea|267036007
and
tachycardia.|3424008|6285003

All symptoms
were
transient|14803004
and
lasted
about 36 hours.|258702006

In a second series symptoms - abdominal pain,|81170007|13039001|21522001|257997001|13039001|21522001|288495006|13039001|21522001
distension,|25322007
watery diarrhea|263930000|398032003
and
eosinophilia -|191357009|419455006|419769007
appeared
at 1 week|258705008|259038000
and
resolved
after 3 weeks.|260313008|258705008

Clinical cases|58147004|398241000|58147004|413769002
have
been
associated|47429007
with acute fever,|272118002|386661006
myalgias,|68962001
bronchospasm,|4386001
pruritic rashes,|64144002
lymphadenopathy,|111590001|30746006
subcutaneous nodules|95325000
associated|47429007
with eosinophilia,|191357009|419455006|419769007
elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate|165468009
and
elevated creatinine kinase levels.|75540009|365756002|304257007

Symptoms
may
last
as long|255511005
as five years.|421820001|258707000

Segmental necrotizing enteritis|62372003|32097002
has
been
reported|229059009|223458004
on one occasion.|421379005|84638005

Definitive diagnosis|261002007|439401001|261002007
by biopsy|86273004
of an infected muscle.|91727004

Sarcocysts
are
identifiable|7882003
with hematoxylin|12710003
and
eosin.|411353000

The PAS stain|15947002
may
be
helpful
but
variable uptake|255372005|258763004
of stain|397165007|127790008
is
common.|72906007

Along
with the sarcocysts inflammatory cells|256923004
may
be
found.|404684003

Other findings|74964007|404684003|74964007
include|55919000
myositis,|26889001
myonecrosis,
perivascular|255564009
and
interstitial inflammation,|125333009
vasculitis|31996006
and
eosinophilic myositis.|370474006

Because
infection
is
rarely symptomatic, treatment|103356009|264931009|276239002|103356009|264931009|416118004
is
rarely|103356009
required.

There
have
been
no published trials|110465008
so
treatment|276239002|416118004
remains
empirical.

Agents|260872001
that
have
been
used|394850002
include|55919000
albendazole,|387558006
metronidazole|372602008
and
cotrimoxazole|398731002
for myositis.|26889001

Corticosteroids|79440004
have
also
been
used|394850002
for symptomatic relief.|264931009|224978009

Amprolium|96146007
and
salinomycin|373561001
was
effective|255403003|254648000
in preventing severe illness|24484000|39104002|116699007|24484000|39104002
and
death|419620001|268923008
in experimentally infected calves|53840002|244015008
and
lambs.|255392003

These agents|260872001
have
not
been
tried
in humans|278412004
to date.|410671006

Infection
can
be
prevented|116699007
by cooking|106373003
the meat|28647000
before eating.|48263008

Alternatively
freezing|48103003
the meat|28647000
at -5C
for several days|261028005|258703001
before ingestion|111984006
will
kill|248007002
the sporocysts.|264574003

Four recognised species|421534005|69658003
infect
cattle
:
_S.|288495006

bovifelis_,
_S.|288495006

bovihominis_
(_S.|288495006

_S.|288495006

cruzi_
(_S.|288495006

bovicanis_
)
and _S.

hirsuta_.

_S.|288495006

cruzi_
is
the only species|50607009|69658003|420295001|69658003
known|36692007
to
be
pathogenic|264418008
in cattle.

A number|410680006|410681005
of clinical syndromes|58147004
have
been
reported|229059009|223458004
in connection|263538003
with this parasite|37763007
:
eosinophilic myositis|370474006
;
abortions,|70317007|386639001
stillbirths|237364002
and

in pregnant cows|77386006|77386006|34618005|127362006|127362006|34618005
;
two cases|420797005|398241000|420797005|413769002
of necrotic encephalitis|6574001|45170000
in heifers
have
also
been
reported.|229059009|223458004

Typical clinical signs|58147004|72670004
of acute bovine sarcocystosis|272118002|88905005|272118002|34618005|88905005
are
:
anorexia,
pyrexia|386661006
(42C

)
,
anemia,|271737000
cachexia,|238108007
enlarged|260376009|118452000
palpable lymph nodes,|103357000|59441001
excessive salivation|275295002
and
loss
of hair|386045008|119326000
at the tip|233445008
of the tail.|13951002

Sheep|388254009|255392003
may
be
infected
by four recognized species|421534005|69658003
of _Sarcocystis_|34666003
:
_S.|288495006

arieticanis_ and _S.

tenella_
(_S.|288495006

ovicanis_
)
are
pathogenic|264418008
;
_S.|288495006

gigantea_
(_S.|288495006

ovifelis_
)
and _S.

medusiformis_
are
non-pathogenic.|264418008

Infection
with these parasites|37763007
is
common|72906007
in the
US
with over 80%|21481007
of sheep|388254009|255392003
examined|64049009
showing
evidence|18669006
of infection.

_S.|288495006

arieticanis_ and _S.

tenella_
both
produce
extra intestinal disease.|85919009

Anemia,|271737000
anorexia,
ataxia,|20262006
and
abortions|70317007|386639001
are
the chief clinical signs.|58147004|72670004

Myositis|26889001
with flaccid paralysis|39157001
has
been
reported|229059009|223458004
as a consequence|103332005
of infection.

Ovine protozoan myeloencephalitis|255392003|417396000|62950007
is
a recognised syndrome
that
may
occur|272120004
in outbreaks.|443684005

The usual pathological findings|394595002|404684003|394595002|29458008|404684003|29458008
in such cases|398241000|413769002
are
multifocal spinal cord white matter oedema|524008|27088001|423666004|524008|279436006|423666004

Exposure|71677004|24932003
to this parasite|37763007
appears
to
be
common|72906007
in the United States|223688001
with serological surveys|27377004
indicating|410535002

birds|387972009
producing
three different clinical forms|421291004|263735002|58147004|246176004
:
an acute pulmonary disease,|2704003|39607008|2704003|264164005|272118002|19829001
muscular disease|129565002

The infection rate
in sheep|388254009|255392003
is
commonly
above 90%.|264705001|264703008

Camels|423870005
have
a similarly high incidence|75540009|371879000
of infection.

Rates
above 80%
are
known|36692007
in cattle
and
goats.|125097000|388249000

The incidence
in water buffaloes,|28692007

80%[15][17]
while
the incidence
in horses,|35354009

There
are
several other genera|261028005|18511007
of heteroxenous

_Isospora_.|26704001

Differentiating|263933003
these genera|18511007
from _Sarcocystis_|34666003
in diagnostic material|439401001|260769002|261004008|260769002
may
be
difficult|52925006
without immunochemical stains.|397165007|127790008

The diagnosis|439401001
is
usually
made
_
post mortum_
by examination|5880005
of the skeletal muscle.|127954009|244716004

In some species|69658003
the cysts|441457006
may
be
visible|24054004
to the naked eye|248160001|81745001|248160001|244486005
(ducks,|396620009

rabbits|88818001
and
sheep|388254009|255392003
)
but
in most microscopic examination|117259009
is
required.

_Ante mortum_ diagnosis|272113006|439401001|272113006
may
be
made
with the use|277889008|419385000
of dermal sensitivity testing|53309004|35209006|53309004|365705006|7952008|7952008|272393004
or
complement fixation tests.|69207009

Muscle biopsy|178263003|309507001
is
also diagnostic|439401001|261004008
but
this
is
much less commonly|242762006|4757001
used.|394850002

Oocysts|103541004
with two sporocysts|420797005|264574003

individual sporocysts|125676002|264574003|385435006|264574003
in human feces|278412004|39477002
are
diagnostic|439401001|261004008
of intestinal infection.|266071000

These
first
appear
14
to 18 days|258703001
after ingesting beef|111984006|226916002
(_S.|288495006

Percoll,
Ficoll-Hypaque
or
other|74964007
such density gradient media|125146005|272077000|61695000

and
those of _S.|18720000

suihominis_ average 10.5
by 13.5 micrometres.|258674000

Because of the overlap|24846002
in size,|277049003
size|277049003
alone|105529008
is
not reliable
as a diagnostic criterion|439401001|261004008
of the species.|69658003

Confirmatory staining|127790008
with the periodic acid-Schiff (PAS)|255808002
