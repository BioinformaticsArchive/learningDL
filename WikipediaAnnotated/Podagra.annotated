when
it
involves|248448006
the big toe|78883009
)
[1]|260305007
is
a medical condition usually|74188005|260905004
characterized
by recurrent attacks|255227004|216299002
of acute inflammatory arthritis?|11939005|272118002|3723001
a red,|386713009|371240000
tender,|300820003
hot,|264018002
swollen joint.|271771009

The metatarsal-phalangeal joint|46658007|28641004|46658007|73696005|239747005|28641004|239747005|73696005|367586008|28641004|367586008|73696005
at the base
of the big toe|78883009
is
the most commonly|4757001
affected|247591002|248448006
(approximately 50%|26175008
of cases|398241000|413769002
).

However,
it
may
also
present|52101004|246105001
as tophi,|240042004
kidney stones,|95570007|444717006
or
urate nephropathy.|236495001

It
is
caused|23981006|134198009
by elevated levels|75540009|258395000
of uric acid|1710001|86228006
in the blood.|87612001|119273009

The uric acid crystallizes,|1710001|264297004|86228006|264297004
and
the crystals|250448002|264297004|413935006
deposit|46595003
in joints,|39352004|81087007
tendons,|13024002
and
surrounding tissues.|355648006|85756007

Clinical diagnosis|39154008
is
confirmed|59156000
by seeing|281004000
the characteristic crystals|250448002|264297004|413935006
in joint fluid.|431898009

Treatment|276239002|416118004
with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs),|372665008
steroids,|116566001
or
colchicine|387413002
improves|385425000|3442003|385633008
symptoms.

Once the acute attack subsides,|272118002|217315002|272118002|216299002
levels|258395000
of uric acid|1710001|86228006
are
usually
lowered|261122009|385440003
via lifestyle changes,|60134006|243326001|60134006|263703002
and
in those with frequent attacks,|260864003|216299002
allopurinol|387135004
or
probenecid|387365004
provide
long-term prevention.|169443000

Gout|90560007
has
increased|35105006|260366006
in frequency|260864003|272123002
in recent decades,|6493001
affecting|247591002|248448006
about 1?2%|303183002
of the Western population|385436007|389109008
at some point
in their lives.|224130005

The increase|260366006
is
believed
due to increasing risk factors|260369004|80943009
in the population,|385436007|389109008
such as metabolic syndrome,|237602007
longer life expectancy|255511005|224130005|410517006
and
changes|243326001|263703002
in diet.|41829006

Gout|90560007
was
historically
known|36692007
as "
the disease|64572001
of kings"
or
"rich man's disease".|224166006|248153007|64572001|224166006|339947000|64572001|224166006|278412004|64572001

Gout|90560007
can
present|52101004|246105001
in a number|410680006|410681005
of ways,
although
the most usual|4757001
is
a recurrent attack|255227004|217315002|255227004|216299002
of acute inflammatory arthritis|11939005|272118002|3723001
(
a red,|386713009|371240000
tender,|300820003
hot,|264018002
swollen joint|271771009
).

The metatarsal-phalangeal joint|46658007|28641004|46658007|73696005|239747005|28641004|239747005|73696005|367586008|28641004|367586008|73696005
at the base
of the big toe|78883009
is
affected most often,|247591002|70232002|248448006|70232002
accounting
for half
of cases.|398241000|413769002

Other joints,|74964007|39352004|74964007|81087007
such as the heels,|76853006
knees,|304679005
wrists|8205005
and
fingers,|7569003|259052003
may
also
be
affected.|247591002|248448006

Joint pain usually|57676002
begins|255395001
over 2?4 hours|123030002
and
during the night.|2546009

The reason|410666004
for onset|77374008
at night|2546009
is
due to the lower body temperature then.|128263001|105723007|128263001|246508008|261122009|105723007

Other symptoms|74964007
may
rarely|103356009
occur|272120004
along
with the joint pain,|57676002
including|55919000
fatigue|84229001
and
a high fever.[1][3]|75540009|386661006|371879000|386661006

Long-standing elevated uric acid levels|255511005|10904000|49099001|258395000
(hyperuricemia|35885006
may
result|394617004
in other symptomatology,|74964007
including|55919000
hard, painless|72505002|255350008
deposits|46595003
of uric acid crystals|250456004
known|36692007
as tophi.|240042004

Extensive tophi|41118005|240042004
may
lead|88488004
to chronic arthritis|35908007
due to bone erosion.

Elevated levels|75540009|258395000
of uric acid|1710001|86228006
may
also
lead|88488004
to crystals|250448002|264297004|413935006
precipitating
in the kidneys,|64033007|17373004
resulting|42752001
in stone formation|384600008|11798007|384600008|255277001
and
subsequent urate nephropathy.[5]|255260001|236495001

Hyperuricemia|35885006
is
the underlying cause|134198009
of gout.|90560007

This
can
occur|272120004
for a number|410680006|410681005
of reasons,|410666004
including|55919000
diet,|41829006
genetic predisposition,|47708004
or
underexcretion
of urate,|86228006|365822004|88476001
the salts|387390002
of uric acid.|1710001|86228006

Renal underexcretion|64033007
of uric acid|1710001|86228006
is
the primary cause|63161005|23981006|63161005|134198009|261424001|23981006|261424001|134198009
of hyperuricemia|35885006
in about 90%|264705001|264703008
of cases,|398241000|413769002
while
overproduction
is
the cause|134198009
in less|276139006|263796003
than 10%.

About 10%
of people|125676002
with hyperuricemia|35885006
develop
gout|90560007
at some point
in their lifetimes.

The risk,|30207005
however,
varies
depending
on the degree|258395000|246173007
of hyperuricemia.|35885006

When
levels|258395000
are
between 415
and
530 ?mol/l (7|21119008|106925002|258717005
and
8.9 mg/dl|258797006
)
,
the risk|30207005
is
0.5%|260316000
per year,|258707000|259039008
while
in those with a level|20401003|258395000|20401003|276625007|421463005|258395000|421463005|276625007
greater|263768009
than 535 ?mol/l (9 mg/dL|258797006|21119008|258797006|106925002|258797006|258717005|258797006|258797006
)
,
the risk|30207005
is
4.5%|264676006
per year.[1]|258707000|259039008

Dietary causes|41829006|134198009
account
for about 12%
of gout,|90560007
[2]|260306008
and
include|55919000
a strong association|260404005|263534001|260404005|272151006
with the consumption
of alcohol,|419442005|53041004|430837008
fructose-sweetened drinks,|58202007|226465004
meat,|28647000
and
seafood.|44027008

Other triggers|74964007
include|55919000
physical trauma|5880005|5880005|19388002|19388002
and
surgery.|83578000

Recent studies|6493001|110465008|6493001|224699009
have
found dietary factors|404684003|41829006|41829006
once
believed
associated|47429007
are
,
in fact,
not,
including|55919000
the intake
of purine-rich vegetables|45386002|224166006|22836000
(
e.g.
,
beans,|256354006
peas,|260184002
lentils,|227350006
and
spinach|256329006
)
and
total protein.|304383000

The consumption
of coffee,|29263009
vitamin C|46123006
and
dairy products,|226760005
as well as
physical fitness,|5880005|5880005|91175000|5880005|102499006|19388002|19388002|91175000|19388002|102499006
appear
to
decrease|260400001|260370003
the risk.|30207005

This
is
believed partly
due to their effect|253861007
in reducing insulin resistance.[13]|260400001|48606007

The occurrence|272120004
of gout|90560007
is
partly genetic,|3950001|255395001
contributing
to about 60%
of variability|255372005
in uric acid level.|1710001|258395000|1710001|276625007|86228006|258395000|86228006|276625007

Three genes|421291004|67271001
called
_SLC2A9_,
_SLC22A12_
and
_ABCG2_
have
been
found|404684003
to commonly
be
associated|47429007
with gout,|90560007
and
variations|40885006
in them
can
approximately|26175008
double|1305003
the risk.|30207005

Loss
of function mutations|246464006|55446002
in _SLC2A9_
and
_SLC22A12_ cause hereditary hypouricaemia|134198009|255404009|4519003
by reducing urate absorption|260400001|86228006|260400001|365822004|260400001|88476001
and
unopposed urate secretion.|86228006|46242002|365822004|46242002|88476001|46242002

A few rare genetic disorders,|57176003|84638005|32895009|57176003|103356009|32895009
including|55919000
familial juvenile hyperuricemic nephropathy,|46785007
medullary cystic kidney disease,|204958008
phosphoribosylpyrophosphate synthetase superactivity,|13304005
and
hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase deficiency|10406007
as
seen
in Lesch-Nyhan syndrome,|10406007
are
complicated|255302009
by gout.[6]|90560007

Gout frequently|90560007|70232002
occurs|272120004
in combination|89780004
with other medical problems.|74964007|74188005|55607006

Metabolic syndrome,|237602007
a combination|89780004
of abdominal obesity,|248311001
hypertension,|38341003
insulin resistance|48606007
and
abnormal lipid levels,|263654008|365791005
occurs|272120004
in nearly 75%
of cases.|398241000|413769002

Other conditions commonly|74964007|260905004
complicated|255302009
by gout|90560007
include|55919000
:
polycythemia,
lead poisoning,|38342005
renal failure,|42399005
hemolytic anemia,|61261009
psoriasis,|9014002
and
solid organ transplants.|313039003

A body mass index|60621009
greater|263768009
than
or
equal|9726003
to 35
increases|260366006
a male's risk|248153007|30207005
of gout threefold.|90560007

Chronic lead exposure|90734009|88488004|71677004|90734009|88488004|24932003
and
lead-contaminated alcohol|88488004|62604006|419442005|88488004|62604006|53041004|88488004|62604006|430837008
are
risk factors|80943009
for gout|90560007
due to the harmful effect|253861007
of lead|88488004
on kidney function.|11953005

Lesch-Nyhan syndrome|10406007
is
often|70232002
associated|47429007
with gouty arthritis.|48440001

Diuretics|372695000
have
been
associated|47429007
with attacks|216299002
of gout.|90560007

However,
a low dose|262459003
of hydrochlorothiazide|387525002
does
not
seem
to
increase|260366006
the risk.|30207005

Other medicines|74964007|410942007
that
have
been
associated|47429007
include|55919000
niacin|63639004
and
aspirin|387458008
(acetylsalicylic acid|387458008
).

The immunosuppressive drugs ciclosporin|372823004|410942007|387467008
and
tacrolimus|386975001|105331000
are
also
associated|47429007
with gout,|90560007
[6]
the former particularly|9130008
when
used|394850002
in combination|89780004
with hydrochlorothiazide.[19]|387525002

Gout|90560007
is
a disorder|64572001
of purine metabolism,|45386002|47722004
[6]
and
occurs|272120004
when
its final metabolite,|42796001
uric acid,|1710001|86228006
crystallizes|264297004
in the form|246176004
of monosodium urate,|312259002
precipitating
in joints,|39352004|81087007
on tendons,|13024002
and
in the surrounding tissues.|355648006|85756007

These crystals then|250448002|264297004|413935006
trigger|410658008
a local immune-mediated inflammatory reaction,|255470001|255386009|73510009|257552002
[4]|260308009
with one|421379005
of the key proteins|88878007
in the inflammatory cascade
being
interleukin 1?.|116722001|50762005

An evolutionary loss
of uricase,|84131000
which
breaks
down uric acid,|1710001|86228006
in humans|278412004
and
higher primates|75540009|388073004|371879000|388073004
has
made
this condition common.[6]|260905004|72906007

The triggers
for precipitation|21738005|418684003
of uric acid|1710001|86228006
are
not well understood.|20572008|66216009

While
it
may
crystallize|264297004
at normal levels,|17621005|258395000|258744000|258395000
it
is
more likely to do so|242762006|2931005
as levels|258395000
increase.|260366006

Other factors|74964007
believed
important
in triggering|410658008
an acute episode|272118002|272128006
of arthritis|3723001
include|55919000
cool temperatures,|246508008
rapid changes|255358001|243326001|255358001|263703002
in uric acid levels,|1710001|258395000|86228006|258395000
acidosis,|51387008
[21][22] articular hydration,|39352004|405006006
and

at low temperatures partly|285686007
explains
why
the joints|39352004|81087007
in the feet|56459004|259051005
are
most commonly|4757001
affected.|247591002|248448006

Rapid changes|255358001|243326001|255358001|263703002

due to a number|410680006|410681005
of factors,
including|55919000
trauma,
surgery,|83578000
chemotherapy,|416608005|367336001
diuretics,|372695000
and
stopping|260890000|385654001|422117008
or
starting allopurinol.|255395001|387135004|385652002|387135004

Calcium channel blockers|373304005
and
losartan|373567002
are
associated|47429007
with a lower risk|261122009|30207005
of gout|90560007
as
compared
to other medications|74964007|410942007
for hypertension.|38341003

[23]|264657009

Gout|90560007
may
be
diagnosed|439401001
and
treated|28995006
without further investigations|46053002|386053000
in someone
with hyperuricemia|35885006
and
the classic podagra.|255301002|67148009|255333006|67148009

Synovial fluid analysis|167859001
should
be
done
,
however,
if
the diagnosis|439401001
is
in doubt.

X-rays,|52250000|168537006
while
useful
for identifying chronic gout,|7882003|68451005
have
little utility|225927009
in acute attacks.[6]|272118002|216299002

A definitive diagnosis|261002007|439401001|261002007
of gout|90560007
is
based|418836005
upon the identification|286672002|7882003
of monosodium urate crystals|250454001
in synovial fluid|431898009
or
a tophus.|240042004

All synovial fluid samples|119332005
obtained|398092000
from undiagnosed inflamed joints|298160000
should
be
examined|64049009
for these crystals.|250448002|264297004|413935006

Under polarized light microscopy,|104157003
they
have
a needle-like morphology|79068005|116676008|79068005|72724002
and
strong negative birefringence.|260404005|260385009

This test|269814003|272393004
is
difficult to|52925006
perform|398166005
,
and
often|70232002
requires
a trained observer.|118629009|62193008

The fluid|32457005|33463005|255765007
must
also
be
examined|64049009
relatively quickly
after
aspiration,|14910006|278847003|129316008|68052005
as
temperature|105723007|246508008
and
pH|27327002|264723009|264724003|264725002|365723003
affect|4065008
their solubility.[6]

Hyperuricemia|35885006
is
a classic feature|255301002|255333006
of gout,|90560007
but
it
occurs|272120004
nearly half
of the time|410669006
without hyperuricemia,|35885006
and
most people|125676002
with raised uric acid levels never|260399008|1710001|258395000|260399008|86228006|258395000
develop
gout.|90560007

Thus,
the diagnostic utility|439401001|225927009|261004008|225927009
of measuring uric acid level|258104002|1710001|258395000|258104002|1710001|276625007|258104002|86228006|258395000|258104002|86228006|276625007|263571004|1710001|258395000|263571004|1710001|276625007|263571004|86228006|258395000|263571004|86228006|276625007
is
limited.|255469002

Hyperuricemia|35885006
is
defined
as a plasma urate level|312482003
greater|263768009
than 420 ?mol/l (7.0 mg/dl|258797006|21119008|258797006|106925002|258797006|258717005|258797006|258797006
)
in males|248153007
and
360 ?mol/l (6.0 mg/dl|258797006|21119008|258797006|106925002|258797006|258717005|258797006|258797006
)
in females.|248152002

Other blood tests commonly|74964007|252275004
performed|398166005
are
white blood cell count,|767002|365630000
electrolytes,|86355000
renal function,|11953005
and
erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR).|416838001|365649001

However,
both
the white blood cells|767002|52501007
and
ESR
may
be
elevated|75540009
due to gout|90560007
in the absence|2667000|418560003
of infection.

A white blood cell count|767002|365630000
as high|75540009|371879000
as 40.0?109/l (40,000/mm3|259031006|258774008|259031006|420167005
)
has
been
documented.[1]|397934002

The most important differential diagnosis|4757001|47965005
in gout|90560007
is
septic arthritis.|372938004|372939007

This
should
be
considered
in those with signs|20401003|72670004|421463005|72670004
of infection
or
those who
do
not
improve|385425000|3442003|385633008
with treatment.|276239002|416118004

To
help
with diagnosis,|439401001
a synovial fluid Gram stain|431898009|385484003|431898009|62777006
and
culture|252398009|61594008
may
be
performed.|398166005

Other conditions|74964007|260905004
that
look|386548000
similar
include|55919000
pseudogout|60782007
and
rheumatoid arthritis.|69896004

Gouty tophi,|240042004
in particular
when
not
located
in a joint,|39352004|81087007|302536002
can
be
mistaken
for basal cell carcinoma,|275265005
[29]
or
other neoplasms.[30]|74964007|108369006

Both
lifestyle changes|60134006|243326001|60134006|263703002
and
medications|410942007
can
decrease|260400001|260370003
uric acid levels.|1710001|258395000|86228006|258395000

Dietary|41829006
and
lifestyle choices|60134006
that
are
effective|255403003|254648000
include|55919000
reducing intake|260400001
of food|255620007
such as meat|28647000
and
seafood,|44027008
consuming
adequate vitamin C,|51117008|46123006|88323005|46123006
limiting|255469002
alcohol|419442005|53041004|430837008
and
fructose consumption,|58202007
and
avoiding obesity.|414915002

A low-calorie diet|77806000
in obese men|414915002|339947000
decreased|1250004|260400001|260371004
uric acid levels|1710001|258395000|86228006|258395000
by 100 ?mol/l (1.7 mg/dl|258797006|21119008|258797006|106925002|258797006|258717005|258797006|258797006
).

Vitamin C intake|286586005
of 1,500 mg|260305007|427264006
per day|258703001|259032004
decreases|260370003
the risk|30207005
of gout|90560007
by 45%.

Coffee,|29263009
but
not tea,|16313001
consumption
is
associated|47429007
with a lower risk|261122009|30207005
of gout.|90560007

Gout|90560007
may
be
secondary to sleep apnea|2603003|73430006
via the release|58000006|68776005|258760001|129299003|115956009
of purines|45386002
from oxygen-starved cells.|24099007|4421005

Treatment|276239002|416118004
of apnea|248583008
can
lessen
the occurrence|272120004
of attacks.[33]|216299002|264667004

The initial aim|884001|232714002
of treatment|276239002|416118004
is
to
settle|128719006
the symptoms
of an acute attack.|272118002|217315002|272118002|216299002

Repeated attacks|27582007|216299002
can
be
prevented|116699007
by different drugs|263735002|410942007
used|394850002
to
reduce|260400001
the serum uric acid levels.|273966000

Ice|896008
applied|410618006
for 20
to 30 minutes|259030007
several|261028005
times a day|258703001|259032004
decreases|260370003
pain.|22253000

Options
for acute treatment|272118002|276239002|272118002|416118004
include|55919000
nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs),|372665008
colchicine|387413002
and
steroids,|116566001
[2]|260306008
while
options
for prevention|169443000
include|55919000
allopurinol,|387135004
febuxostat|441610003
and
probenecid.|387365004

Lowering|261122009
uric acid levels|1710001|258395000|86228006|258395000
can
cure
the disease.|64572001

Treatment|276239002|416118004
of comorbidities
is
also important.[6]

NSAIDs|372665008
are
the usual first-line treatment|255216001|50009006|276239002|255216001|50009006|416118004|232714002|50009006|276239002|232714002|50009006|416118004
for gout,|90560007
and
no specific agent|69658003|260872001
is
significantly more
or
less effective|276139006|255403003|276139006|254648000|263796003|255403003|263796003|254648000
than any other.|74964007

Improvement
may
be
seen
within four hours,|421534005|258702006
and
treatment|276239002|416118004
is
recommended
for one|421379005
to two weeks.|420797005|258705008

They
are
not
recommended
,
however,
in those with certain other health problems,|20401003|17162000|263775005|55607006|20401003|255544004|263775005|55607006|421463005|17162000|263775005|55607006|421463005|255544004|263775005|55607006
such as gastrointestinal bleeding,|74474003
renal failure,|42399005
or
heart failure.|84114007|42343007

While
indomethacin|373513008
has
historically
been
the most commonly used NSAID,|4757001|394850002|372665008
an alternative,
such as ibuprofen,|387207008
may
be
preferred|225773000
due to its better side effect profile|3442003
in the absence|2667000|418560003
of superior effectiveness.|261183002|255403003

For those at risk|410519009
of gastric side effects|69695003|264010009
from NSAIDs,|372665008
an additional proton pump inhibitor|260364009|372525000
may
be
given.[37]|419582001

Colchicine|387413002
is
an alternative
for those unable to|371151008
tolerate
NSAIDs.|372665008

Its side effects
(primarily gastrointestinal upset|95516005
)
limit|255469002
its usage.|277889008

Gastrointestinal upset, however,|95516005
depends
on the dose,|277406006|408102007
and
the risk|30207005
can
be
decreased|1250004|260400001|260371004
by
using|260676000
smaller yet still effective doses.|263796003|255403003|277406006|263796003|254648000|277406006|255507004|255403003|277406006|255507004|254648000|277406006

Colchicine|387413002
may
interact
with other commonly prescribed drugs,|74964007|410942007
such as atorvastatin|373444002
and
erythromycin,|372694001
among others.[38]|74964007|264670000

Glucocorticoids|419933005
have
been
found|404684003
as effective|255403003|254648000
as NSAIDs[39]|372665008
and
may
be
used|394850002
if contraindications|103306004|397745006
exist
for NSAIDs.|372665008

They also
lead|88488004
to improvement
when
injected|422145002
into the joint|39352004|81087007|302536002
;
a joint infection|363162000
must
be
excluded|77765009
,
however,
as
steroids|116566001
worsens|230993007|390772001
this condition.[2]|260905004

Pegloticase
(Krystexxa
)
was
approved|9571008
in the USA to|223688001
treat|395077000
gout|90560007
in 2010.

It
is
an option
for the 3%|260313008
of people|125676002
who
are
intolerant
to other medications.|74964007|410942007

Pegloticase
is
administered|418283001
as an intravenous infusion|14152002|385228000
every two weeks,|420797005|258705008
[40]|259031006
and
has
been
found|404684003
to
reduce|260400001
uric acid levels|1710001|258395000|86228006|258395000
in this population.[41]|385436007|389109008

A number|410680006|410681005
of medications|410942007
are
useful
for preventing further episodes|46053002|272128006|116699007|46053002|272128006
of gout,|90560007

xanthine oxidase inhibitor|419262004
(

of worsening|230993007|231877006
the attack,|217315002|216299002

have
not
been
found|404684003
cost effective|255403003|254648000
until this point.

Urate-lowering measures|86228006|261122009|246445000|86228006|261122009|367346004|365822004|261122009|246445000|365822004|261122009|367346004|88476001|261122009|246445000|88476001|261122009|367346004
should
be
increased|35105006|260366006
until serum uric acid levels|273966000
are
below 300?360 ?mol/l (5.0-6.0 mg/dl|258797006|21119008|258797006|106925002|258797006|258717005|258797006|258797006

used chronically|394850002
at the time|410669006
of an attack,|217315002|216299002
discontinueation

than allopurinol.[2]|387135004

Uricosuric medications|410942007
are
typically
preferred|225773000
if undersecretion
of uric acid,|1710001|86228006
as
indicated|410535002
by a 24-hour collection|123027009|259029002

preferred.[43]|225773000

Xanthine oxidase inhibitors|419262004
(
including|55919000

and
febuxostat|441610003

uric acid production,|1710001|86228006
and
long-term therapy|276239002
is
safe
and
well tolerated,|20572008
and
can
be
used|394850002
in people|125676002
with renal impairment|236423003
or
urate stones,|86228006|384600008|365822004|384600008|88476001|384600008

allopurinol|387135004
has
caused hypersensitivity|23981006|421961002|23981006|421369008|134198009|421961002|134198009|421369008

of individuals.|125676002|385435006

In such cases,|398241000|413769002
the alternative drug,|410942007
febuxostat,|441610003
has
been
recommended.[44]

Without treatment,|276239002|416118004
an acute attack|272118002|217315002|272118002|216299002
of gout usually|90560007
resolves
in five|421820001
to seven days.|420359007|258703001

However,
60%
of people|125676002
have

Those with gout|20401003|90560007|421463005|90560007
are
at increased risk|35105006|30207005|260366006|30207005

of death.|419620001|268923008

This
may
be
partly
due to its association|263534001|272151006
with insulin resistance|48606007
and
obesity,|414915002
but
some
of the increased risk|35105006|30207005|260366006|30207005
appears
to
be
independent.[45]|371153006

Without treatment,|276239002|416118004
episodes|272128006
of acute gout|11939005
may
develop
into chronic gout|68451005

These tophi|240042004
occur|272120004

Gout|90560007
affects|4065008
around 1?2%|303183002
of the Western population|385436007|389109008
at some point
in their lifetimes,
and
is
becoming
more common.|242762006|72906007

Rates
of gout|90560007
have
approximately|26175008
doubled|1305003
between 1990
and
2010.

This rise
is
believed
due to increasing life expectancy,|260369004|224130005|410517006
changes|243326001|263703002
in diet,|41829006
and
an increase|260366006
in diseases|64572001
associated|47429007
with gout,|90560007
such as metabolic syndrome|237602007
and
high blood pressure.|38341003

A number|410680006|410681005
of factors
have
been
found|404684003
to
influence
rates
of gout,|90560007
including|55919000
age,|424144002
race,|415229000
and
the season|21864008
of the year.|258707000|259039008

In men|339947000
over the age|424144002
of 30
and

over the age|424144002

prevalence
is
2%.[36]|260306008

In the United States,|223688001
gout|90560007
is
twice|421832002
as
likely|2931005
in African American males|15086000|248153007
as
it
is
in European Americans.|414152003

Rates
are
high|75540009|371879000
among the peoples|125676002
of the Pacific Islands|288560006
and
the M?ori|258311008
of New Zealand,|223625001
but
rare|84638005|103356009
in Australian aborigines,|413600007
despite
a higher mean concentration|75540009|255586005|82742001|371879000|255586005|82742001

and
urban sub-Saharan Africa.|224807002|409988000

Some
studies|110465008|224699009
have
found attacks|404684003|216299002|216299002
of gout|90560007
occur|272120004
more frequently|242762006|70232002
in the spring.

This
has
been
attributed|246061005
to seasonal changes|21864008|243326001|21864008|263703002
in diet,|41829006
alcohol consumption,|160573003

and
temperature.[48]|105723007|246508008

The word "gout"|255373000|90560007
was
initially|884001
used|394850002
by Randolphus
of Bocking,
around 1200 AD.

It
is
derived
from the Latin word _gutta_,|255373000
meaning|255586005
"
a drop"|404218003
(
of liquid|33463005|264312008
).

According to the Oxford English Dictionary,|297487008|25804004
this
is
derived
from humorism
and
"
the notion
of the 'dropping'|426684005|404218003
of a morbid material|260769002
from the blood|87612001|119273009
in
and
around the joints".[50]|39352004|81087007

Gout|90560007
has
,
however,
been
known|36692007
since
antiquity.

Historically,
it
has
been
referred|439980006
to
as
"
the king
of diseases|64572001
and
the disease|64572001
of kings"[6][51]
or
"rich man's disease".|224166006|248153007|64572001|224166006|339947000|64572001|224166006|278412004|64572001

The first documentation|255216001|23745001|232714002|23745001
of the disease|64572001
is
from Egypt|223511009
in 2,600 BC|260306008
in a description
of arthritis|3723001
of the big toe.|78883009

The Greek physician Hippocrates|1451003|309343006
around 400 BC
commented
on it
in his _Aphorisms_,
noting
its absence|2667000|418560003
in eunuchs
and
premenopausal women.|224526002

Aulus Cornelius Celsus
(30 AD
)
described
the linkage
with alcohol,|419442005|53041004|430837008
later onset|77374008
in women,|224526002
and
associated kidney problems|47429007|64033007|55607006|47429007|17373004|55607006|47429007|181414000|55607006
:

Again thick urine,|246703001|78014005
the sediment
from which
is
white,|413773004|185984009|371251000
indicates|410535002
that pain|22253000
and
disease|64572001
are
to
be
apprehended
in the region|410673009
of joints|39352004|81087007
or
viscera...|276434005

Joint troubles|39352004|81087007|302536002
in the hands|85562004
and
feet|56459004|259051005
are
very frequent|260358002|70232002
and
persistent,
such as
occur|272120004
in cases|398241000|413769002
of podagra|67148009
and
cheiragra.

These seldom|103356009
attack|217315002|216299002
eunuchs
or
boys|433152004
before coition|258139002|70256003
with a woman,|224526002
or
women|224526002
except those in whom|52101004|18720000
the menses|248957007|282027006
have
become
suppressed...|245780008

some
have
obtained lifelong security|398092000
by refraining
from wine,|35748005
mead
and
venery.[54]

In 1683,
Thomas Sydenham,
an English physician,|297487008|309343006|25804004|309343006
described
its occurrence|272120004
in the early hours|264499004|258702006
of the morning,|73775008
and
its predilection
for older males|70753007|248153007
:

Gouty patients|90560007|116154003
are
,
generally,
either
old men,|70753007|339947000
or
men|339947000
who
have
so|223528007
worn
themselves out|255529000
in youth|22396007
as to
have
brought|68369002
on a premature old age?|1090009|105436006|1090009|32864002
of such dissolute habits none|90275003|260413007
being
more common|242762006|72906007
than the premature|1090009
and
excessive indulgence|260378005
in venery,
and
the
like exhausting passions.|279123003

The victim goes
to bed|229772003
and
sleeps|258158006
in good health.|405153007

About two o'clock|420797005
in the morning|73775008
he
is
awakened|421355008
by a severe pain|76948002
in the great toe|78883009|302546000
;
more rarely|242762006|103356009
in the heel,|76853006|362804005
ankle|70258002|108371006|361292008
or
instep.|69048003

The pain|22253000
is
like that
of a dislocation,|108367008
and
yet parts|260726005
feel|285854004
as if
cold water|285686007|11713004|285686007|119318008|82272006|11713004|82272006|119318008|84162001|11713004|84162001|119318008
were
poured
over|21481007
them.

Then
follows|367409002
chills|43724002
and
shivers,
and
a little fever...|281411007|386661006|255507004|386661006

The night|2546009
is
passed
in torture,|248006006
sleeplessness,|193462001
turning|282987006
the part|260726005
affected,|247591002|248448006
and
perpetual change|243326001|263703002
of posture|363855006
;
the tossing about
of body|279495008|123037004
being
as incessant
as the pain|22253000
of the tortured joint,|248006006|39352004|248006006|81087007|248006006|302536002
and
being
worse|230993007|390772001|231877006
as the fit|91175000|102499006
comes
on.[55]|264691008

The Dutch scientist Antonie van Leeuwenhoek|9533000|308027003|224832000
first
described
the microscopic appearance|84496004|386548000|84496004|255412001
of urate crystals|250456004
in 1679.

In 1848,
English physician Alfred Baring Garrod|297487008|309343006|25804004|309343006
realized
this excess uric acid|260378005|1710001|260378005|86228006
in the blood|87612001|119273009
was
the cause|134198009
of gout.[56]|90560007

Gout|90560007
is
rare|84638005|103356009
in most other animals|74964007|387961004
due to their ability to|371150009
produce
uricase,|84131000
which
breaks
down uric acid.|1710001|86228006

Humans|278412004
and
other great apes|74964007|389213009|74964007
do
not
have
this ability,|371150009
thus gout|90560007
is
common.|72906007

The _Tyrannosaurus rex_ specimen|1809004|123038009
known|36692007
as "Sue",
however,
is
believed to
have
suffered
from gout.[58]|90560007

A number|410680006|410681005
of new medications|7147002|410942007
are
under study|110465008|224699009
for treating gout,|28995006|90560007
including|55919000
anakinra,|385549000
canakinumab,
and
rilonacept.|430868007

A recombinant uricase enzyme|84131000|90668006
(rasburicase|415249009
is
available|103328004
;
its use,|277889008|419385000
however,
is
limited,|255469002
as
it
triggers
an autoimmune response.|263680009

Less antigenic versions|276139006|7120007|22303008|263796003|7120007|22303008

in development.[1]|278923009
