is
a gynecological medical condition|394586005|74188005|260905004
in which cells|4421005
from the lining|50009006
of the uterus|35039007|181452004
(endometrium|2739003|278867007

and
flourish
outside the uterine cavity,|52393002
most commonly
on the peritoneum|15425007
which
lines|50009006
the abdominal cavity.|52731004|361294009

The uterine cavity|52393002
is
lined|50009006
with endometrial cells,|2739003|4421005|278867007|4421005
which
are
under the influence
of female hormones.|248152002|87568004|224526002|87568004

Endometrial-|2739003|278867007
like cells|4421005
in areas|42798000
outside the uterus|35039007|181452004
(endometriosis|129103003
)
are
influenced
by hormonal changes|278994005|243326001|278994005|263703002
and
respond
in a way
that
is
similar
to the cells|4421005
found|404684003
inside the uterus.|35039007|181452004

Symptoms often|70232002
worsen|230993007|390772001
with the menstrual cycle.|78456001

Endometriosis|129103003
is
typically
seen
during the reproductive years|258707000
;
it
has
been
estimated|414135002
that endometriosis|129103003
occurs|272120004
in roughly 6?10%
of women.|224526002

Symptoms
may
depend
on the site|10546003
of active endometriosis.|55561003|129103003

Its main|63161005
but
not universal symptom|73548004
is
pelvic pain|30473006
in various manifestations.|256220008|250255003|256220008|251190009

Endometriosis|129103003
is
a common finding|72906007|404684003|72906007
in women|224526002
with infertility.[1]|8619003

A major symptom|255603008
of endometriosis|129103003
is
recurring|246455001|255227004
pelvic pain.|30473006

The pain|22253000
can
range
from mild|255604002
to severe cramping|24484000|55300003|24484000|410709000
that
occurs|272120004
on
both
sides|182353008
of the pelvis,|277113001|21844003|229765004
in the lower back|37822005|264072009
and
rectal area,|255582007|42798000|42798000
and
even
down the legs.|30021000

The amount|107651007
of pain|22253000
a woman feels|224526002|285854004
correlates
poorly|556001
with the extent|255590007
or
stage|21191007|371508000|261612004

while
other women|74964007|224526002

they
have
only
a few small areas|57176003|255507004|42798000

Endometriosis lesions|129103003
react
to hormonal stimulation|278994005|122545008
and
may
"
bleed|131148009
"
at the time|410669006
of menstruation.|248957007

The blood|87612001|119273009
accumulates
locally,
causes|134198009
swelling,|423666004|442672001
and
triggers
inflammatory responses
with the activation
of cytokines.|75777003

This process|415178003
may
cause|23981006|134198009
pain.|22253000

Pain|22253000
can
also
occur|272120004
from adhesions|42685002
(internal scar tissue|260521003|70582006|260521003|275322007

Also,
endometriotic lesions|129103003
can
develop
their own nerve supply,|260917002
thereby
creating
a direct|255589003
and
two-way interaction|420797005
between lesions
and
the central nervous system,|21483005|278199004
potentially
producing
a variety
of individual differences|125676002|263735002|385435006|263735002
in pain|22253000
that
can
,
in some women,|224526002
become
independent of the disease|64572001
itself.[2]|260306008

Many women|260396001|224526002
with infertility|8619003
may
have
endometriosis.|129103003

As endometriosis|129103003
can
lead|88488004
to anatomical distortions|36298004|20967005
and
adhesions|42685002

form|246176004
between tissues|85756007
and

recovery
from an injury
)
,
the causality|134198009
may
be
easy to|36203004
understand|66216009
;
however,
the link
between infertility|8619003
and
endometriosis|129103003
remains
enigmatic
when
the extent|255590007
of endometriosis|129103003
is
limited.|255469002

It
has
been
suggested
that endometriotic lesions release factors|129103003|58000006|129103003|68776005|129103003|258760001|129103003|129299003|129103003|115956009
which
are
detrimental
to gametes|308838004
or
embryos,|57991002
or
,
alternatively,
endometriosis|129103003
may
more likely|242762006|2931005
develop
in women|224526002
who
fail
to
conceive
for other reasons|74964007|410666004
and
thus
be
a secondary phenomenon|2603003|81170007
;
for this reason|410666004
it
is
preferable
to speak|87335007|286370002
of endometriosis-associated infertility.[6]|129103003|47429007|8619003

Other symptoms|74964007
include|55919000
constipation[4]|14760008
and
chronic fatigue.[7]|90734009|84229001

In addition|260364009
to pain|22253000
during menstruation,|248957007
the pain|22253000
of endometriosis|129103003
can
occur|272120004

There
can
be

from standing|10904000
or
walking,|129006008
and
pain|22253000
with intercourse.|258139002

But
the most desperate pain|4757001|22253000
is
usually
with menstruation|248957007
and
many women|260396001|224526002

their periods.|259037005

Pain|22253000
can
also

It
has
been
proposed
that endometriosis|129103003
results|394617004
from a series|13039001
of multiple hits|260396001|282660005
within target genes,|67271001
in a mechanism|257544000
similar
to the development|278923009
of cancer.|363346000|372087000

In this case,|398241000
the initial mutation|884001|55446002|232714002|55446002
may
be
either
somatic|387133006

heritable.[14]|255404009

Endometriosis|129103003
has
more time to|242762006|410669006

scarring|275322007
of the ovary|15497006|83238006|181464007
and
tubes|83059008|418530008

they
cannot

Endometriosis|129103003
in postmenopausal women|76498008|224526002
does
occur|272120004
and
has
been
described
as an aggressive form|61372001|246176004|246176004
of this disease|64572001
characterized
by complete progesterone resistance|255594003|16683002|30714006
and
extraordinarily high levels|75540009|258395000|371879000|258395000
of aromatase expression.|423075001|10012005

In less common cases,|276139006|72906007|398241000|276139006|72906007|413769002|263796003|72906007|398241000|263796003|72906007|413769002
girls|431549007
may
have
endometriosis symptoms|129103003
before
they even
reach|282679008
menarche.[20][21]|20016009

While
the exact cause|134198009
of endometriosis remains|129103003
unknown|261665006
,
many theories
have
been
presented|246105001
to better|3442003
understand|66216009
and
explain
its development.|278923009

These concepts
do
not necessarily
exclude|77765009
each other.

The pathophysiology|386585008
of endometriosis|129103003
is
likely to|2931005
be
multifactorial
and
to
involve|248448006
an interplay
between several factors.[14]|261028005

Broadly,
the aspects
of the pathophysiology|386585008
can
basically
be
classified|73504009
as underlying predisposing factors,
metabolic changes,|243326001|263703002
formation|11798007|255277001
of ectopic endometrium,|298109001|2739003|298109001|278867007
and
generation
of pain|22253000
and
other effects.|74964007|253861007

It
is
not certain, however,|17162000|255544004
to what degree predisposing factors|258395000|246173007
lead|88488004
to metabolic changes|243326001|263703002
and
so|223528007
on,
or
if metabolic changes|243326001|263703002
or
formation|11798007|255277001
of ectopic endometrium|298109001|2739003|298109001|278867007
is
the primary cause.|63161005|23981006|63161005|134198009|261424001|23981006|261424001|134198009

Also,
there
are
several theories|261028005
within each category,
but
the uncertainty|64957009
over what
is
a cause|134198009
versus
what
is
an effect|253861007
when
considered
in relation to other aspects|74964007
is
as true|31874001
for any individual entry|125676002|385435006
in the pathophysiology|386585008
of endometriosis.[14]|129103003

Also,
pathogenic mechanisms|264418008|257544000
appear
to
differ
in the formation|11798007|255277001
of distinct types|261664005
of endometriotic lesion,|129103003
such as peritoneal, ovarian|15425007|15497006|15425007|83238006|15425007|181464007|264143006|15497006|264143006|83238006|264143006|181464007
and
rectovaginal lesions.[14]|264171000

The main theories|63161005
for the formation|11798007|255277001
of ectopic endometrium|298109001|2739003|298109001|278867007
are
retrograde menstruation,|13180005
m?llerianosis,|258311008
coelomic metaplasia|17665002
and
transplantation,|263903005
each further|46053002
described
below.

The theory
of retrograde menstruation|13180005
(also
called
the _implantation theory_|71861002|25602002
or
_transplantation theory_|263903005
)
[22]
is
the most widely accepted theory|4757001|385645004
for the formation|11798007|255277001
of ectopic endometrium|298109001|2739003|298109001|278867007
in endometriosis.|129103003

It
suggests
that
during a woman's menstrual flow,|224526002|248957007
some
of the endometrial debris|2739003|257159000|278867007|257159000
exits|5173006
the uterus|35039007|181452004
through the fallopian tubes|414982008
and
attaches|102491009
itself
to the peritoneal surface|15425007|410678000|264143006|410678000
(
the lining|50009006
of the abdominal cavity|52731004|361294009
)
where it
can
proceed
to
invade
the tissue|85756007
as endometriosis.[14]|129103003

While
most women|224526002
may
have
some retrograde menstrual flow,|312004007|248957007|103363009|248957007
typically
their immune system|116003000
is
able to|371150009
clear|263707001
the debris|257159000
and
prevent
implantation|71861002|25602002
and
growth
of cells|4421005
from this occurrence.|272120004

However,
in some patients,|116154003
endometrial tissue|2739003|85756007|278867007|85756007
transplanted|263903005|24486003
by retrograde menstruation|13180005
may
be
able to|371150009
implant|40388003|71861002|64218007
and
establish|263748003
itself
as
endometriosis.|129103003

Factors
that
might
cause|23981006|134198009
the tissue to|85756007
grow
in some women|224526002
but
not
in others|74964007
need|410525008|103325001
to
be
studied|110465008|224699009
,
and
some
of the possible causes|371930009|134198009|60022001|134198009
below
may
provide
some explanation,
_
e.g.
_,
hereditary factors,|255404009
toxins,|80917008
or
a compromised immune system.|116003000

It
can
be
argued
that
the uninterrupted occurrence|272120004
of regular menstruation month|17854005|248957007|258706009|17854005|248957007|259036001
after month|258706009|259036001
for decades
is
a modern phenomenon,
as
in the past women|410513005|224526002
had
more frequent menstrual rest|242762006|52754008|258157001
due to pregnancy|289908002
and
lactation.|169741004|63158009

Retrograde menstruation|13180005
alone|105529008
is
not able to|371150009
explain
all instances
of endometriosis,|129103003
and
it
needs|410525008|103325001
additional factors|260364009
such as genetic|3950001|255395001
or
immune differences to|255386009|263735002
account
for the fact
that
many women|224526002
with retrograde menstruation|13180005
do
not
have
endometriosis.|129103003

Research
is
focusing|251776000
on the possibility
that
the immune system|116003000
may
not
be
able to|371150009
cope|405056001
with the cyclic onslaught|44180009
of retrograde menstrual fluid.|312004007|37841008|103363009|37841008

In this context there|263491009
is
interest|225469004
in studying|110465008|224699009
the relationship|272151006
of endometriosis|129103003
to autoimmune disease,|85828009
allergic reactions,|421961002
and
the impact|134293005
of toxins.|80917008

It
is
still unclear
what,
if
any,
causal relationship|134198009|272151006
exists
between toxins,|80917008
autoimmune disease,|85828009
and
endometriosis|129103003

In addition,|260364009
at least one study|276139006|421379005|110465008|276139006|421379005|224699009|263796003|421379005|110465008|263796003|421379005|224699009
found|404684003
that endometriotic lesions|129103003
are
biochemically very different|260358002|263735002
from artificially
transplanted|263903005|24486003
ectopic tissue.|417338002

The latter finding,|404684003
however,
can
in turn|282987006
be
explained
by
that
the cells|4421005
that
establish|263748003
endometrial lesions|2739003|278867007
are
not
of the main cell type|63161005|4421005|63161005|246238003
in ordinary endometrium,|2739003|278867007
but
rather
of a side population cell type,|182353008|385436007|4421005|182353008|385436007|246238003|182353008|389109008|4421005|182353008|389109008|246238003
as
supported|9096001|243114000
by exhibitition
of a side population phenotype|182353008|385436007|8116006|182353008|385436007|363778006|182353008|389109008|8116006|182353008|389109008|363778006
upon staining|127790008
with Hoechst dye|61789006
and
by flow cytometric analysis.[14]|64444005|272389005

In rare cases|84638005|398241000|84638005|413769002|103356009|398241000|103356009|413769002
where imperforate hymen|65937002
does
not
resolve
itself
prior to the first menstrual cycle|20016009
and
goes
undetected
,
blood|87612001|119273009
and
endometrium|2739003|278867007
are
trapped|403833009
within the uterus|35039007|181452004
of the patient|116154003
until such time|410669006
as the problem|55607006
is
resolved
by surgical incision.|34896006|112633009

Many health care practitioners never|260396001|263775005
encounter
this defect,|6920004
and
due to the flu-like symptoms|315642008
it
is
often|70232002
misdiagnosed
or
overlooked
until multiple menstrual cycles|260396001|78456001
have
passed.

By the time|410669006
a correct diagnosis|439401001
has
been
made
,
endometrium|2739003|278867007
and
other fluids|74964007|32457005|74964007|33463005
have
filled
the uterus|35039007|181452004
and
fallopian tubes|414982008
with results|394617004
similar
to retrograde menstruation|13180005
resulting|42752001
in endometriosis.|129103003

The initial stage|884001|21191007|884001|371508000|884001|261612004|232714002|21191007|232714002|371508000|232714002|261612004
of endometriosis|129103003
may
vary
based|418836005
on the time|410669006
elapsed
between onset|77374008
and
surgical procedure.|83578000

The theory
of retrograde menstruation|13180005
as a cause|134198009
of endometriosis|129103003
was
first|255216001|232714002
proposed
by [John A.

Sampson]
(/wiki/John_A._Sampson
).

Most endometriosis|129103003
is
found|404684003
on these structures
in the pelvic cavity|21844003|281903009

Endometriosis|129103003
may
also
present|52101004|246105001
with skin lesions|95324001
in cutaneous endometriosis.|35543003

lesions
can
be
found|404684003
on the diaphragm.|263734003|336704008|181614006

Diaphragmatic endometriosis|263734003|129103003
is
rare, almost always on|84638005|103356009
the right hemidiaphragm,|24028007|423500004

may
inflict
cyclic pain|44180009|22253000

during menses.|248957007|282027006

Rarely,|103356009
endometriosis|129103003
can
be
extraperitoneal|260641002

endometriosis.|129103003

Laparoscopy,|108191006
a surgical procedure|83578000
where a camera|14364002
is
used to|394850002
look|386548000
inside the abdominal cavity,|52731004|361294009
is
the gold standard|2309006|371256005
in diagnosis.|439401001

However,
in the United States|223688001
most insurance plans|52713000|397943006
will
not
cover|255334000
surgical diagnosis|83578000|439401001|83578000
unless
the patient|116154003
has
already
attempted
to
become
pregnant|77386006|127362006
and
failed.

Use|277889008|419385000
of imaging tests|363679005|269814003|363679005|272393004|278395004|269814003|278395004|272393004

It also
may
identify|7882003
free fluid often|41699000|70232002
within the Recto-uterine pouch.|53843000

The two most common imaging tests|420797005|72906007|363679005|269814003|420797005|72906007|363679005|272393004|420797005|72906007|278395004|269814003|420797005|72906007|278395004|272393004
are
ultrasound|359659005
and
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).|113091000

Normal results|280413001
on these tests|269814003|272393004
do
not
eliminate
the possibility
of endometriosis.|129103003

Areas|42798000
of endometriosis|129103003
are
often too small to|70232002|255507004
be
seen
by these tests.|269814003|272393004

The only way to|50607009|420295001
diagnose|439401001
endometriosis|129103003
is
by laparoscopy|108191006
or
other types|74964007|261664005
of surgery|83578000
with lesion biopsy._[citation|86273004
needed|410525008|103325001

The diagnosis|439401001
is
based|418836005
on the characteristic appearance|386548000|255412001
of the disease,|64572001
and
should
be
corroborated
by a biopsy.|86273004

Surgery|83578000
for diagnoses also|439401001
allows
for surgical treatment|83578000
of endometriosis|129103003
at the same time.|262126009|410669006

Although
doctors|309343006
can
often|70232002
feel|285854004
the endometrial growths|2739003|278867007
during a pelvic exam,|35025007
and
these symptoms
may
be
signs|72670004
of endometriosis,|129103003
diagnosis|439401001
cannot
be
confirmed|59156000
without performing|398166005
a laparoscopic procedure.|108191006|51316009

To the eye,|81745001|244486005
lesions
can
appear

Lesions
vary
in size.|277049003

Some
within the pelvis walls|3665003
may
not
be

endometriosis|129103003
on biopsy|86273004
in 6?13%
of cases.|398241000|413769002

Early endometriosis typically|264499004|129103003
occurs|272120004
on the surfaces|410678000
of organs|410653004
in the pelvic|277113001
and
intra-abdominal areas.|272114000|277112006|42798000

Health care providers
may
call
areas|42798000
of endometriosis|129103003
by different names,|263735002
such as implants,|40388003
lesions,
or
nodules.|27925004|279365004

Larger lesions|255509001|263768009
may
be
seen
within the ovaries|15497006|83238006
as ovarian endometriomas|116342008
or
"chocolate cysts",|116342008

Often|70232002
the symptoms

are
identical|20323000
to those

If surgery|83578000
is
not
performed|398166005
,
then
a diagnosis|439401001
of exclusion process|415178003
is
used.|394850002

This means|255586005
that
all
of the other plausible causes|74964007|134198009
of pelvic pain|30473006
are
ruled|10828004
out.|255529000

For example,
internal hernias|30477007
are
difficult to|52925006
identify|7882003
in women,|224526002
and
misdiagnosis
with endometriosis|129103003
is
very common.|260358002|72906007

One cause|421379005|134198009
of misdiagnosis
is
that
when
the woman|224526002
lies|40199007|255576009
down flat|6041008|257564005
on an examination table,|5880005|86407004
all
of the medical signs|74188005|72670004
of the hernia|414403008
disappear
,
but
the woman typically|224526002
has
tenderness|247348008
and
other symptoms|74964007
associated|47429007
with endometriosis|129103003
in a pelvic exam.|35025007

The hernia|414403008
can
typically only
be
detected|260373001
when
symptoms
are
present,|52101004|246105001
so
diagnosis|439401001
requires
positioning|226048001|246449006|229824005
the woman's body|224526002|279495008|224526002|123037004
in a way
that
provokes|410658008

Surgically,|83578000
endometriosis|129103003
can
be
staged|21191007|72589006|371508000|261612004

The process|415178003
is
a complex point system|103360007|246333005
that assesses
lesions
and
adhesions|42685002
in the pelvic organs,|8279000
but
it
is
important to
note
staging assesses physical disease only,|72589006|5880005|64572001|72589006|19388002|64572001
not
the level|258395000|276625007
of pain|22253000
or
infertility.|8619003

A patient|116154003
with Stage I endometriosis|258215001|129103003
may
have
little disease|281411007
and
severe pain,|76948002
while
a patient|116154003
with Stage IV endometriosis|21191007|129103003|371508000|129103003|261612004|129103003
may
have
severe disease|24484000|64572001
and
no pain|22253000
or
vice versa.

In principle
the various stages|256220008|261612004
show
these findings|404684003
:

Endometrioma|116342008|237116001
on the ovary|15497006|83238006|181464007
of any significant size|386134007|277049003
(Approx.

2 cm +|260306008
)
must
be
removed|127485006
surgically because hormonal treatment|83578000|278994005|276239002|83578000|278994005|416118004
alone|105529008
will
not
remove|127485006
the full endometrioma cyst,|261015003|116342008|441457006|261015003|116342008|103552005|261015003|237116001|441457006|261015003|237116001|103552005
which
can
progress|385651009
to acute pain|274663001
from the rupturing|415747007|263862003
of the cyst|441457006|103552005
and
internal bleeding.|260521003|131148009

Endometrioma|116342008|237116001
is
sometimes
misdiagnosed
as ovarian cysts.|79883001

An area|42798000
of research
is
the search
for endometriosis markers.[33]|129103003|264667004

A systematic review|415300000
in 2010
of essentially
all proposed biomarkers
for endometriosis|129103003
in serum,|67922002
plasma|419185008
and
urine|78014005
came
to the conclusion
that none|260413007
of them
have
been
clearly
shown
to
be
of clinical use,|58147004|277889008|58147004|419385000
although
some
appear
to
be
promising.

Another review
in 2011 identified several putative biomarkers|7882003
upon biopsy,|86273004
including|55919000
findings|404684003
of small sensory nerve fibers|255507004|262139008|88545005
or
defectively
expressed ?3 integrin subunit.[34]

The one biomarker|421379005
that
has
been
used|394850002
in clinical practice|58147004
over the last 20 years|258707000
is
CA-125.|103084007

However,
its performance
in diagnosing endometriosis|439401001|129103003
is
low, even|62482003|371880002
though
it
shows
some promise
in detecting more severe disease.|260373001|24484000|64572001

CA-125 levels|103084007|258395000
appear
to
fall|1912002
during endometriosis treatment,|129103003|276239002|129103003|416118004
but
has
not
shown
a correlation
with disease response.[33]|64572001|264667004

It
has
been
postulated
a future diagnostic tool|439401001|86967005|261004008|86967005
for endometriosis|129103003
will
consist
of a panel|261586004
of several biomarkers,|261028005
including|55919000
both
substance concentrations|118556004
and
genetic predisposition.[33]|47708004|264667004

Typical endometriotic lesions|129103003
show
histopathologic features|394597005
similar
to endometrium,|2739003|278867007
namely endometrial stroma,|40749002|254115004
endometrial epithelium,|2739003|31610004|278867007|31610004
and
glands|362884007
that
respond
to hormonal stimuli.|278994005|8927009

Older lesions|70753007
may
display
no glands|362884007
but
hemosiderindeposits
as residual.|65320000

Limited evidence|255469002|18669006
indicates|410535002
that
the use|277889008|419385000
of combined oral contraceptives|346388008
is
associated|47429007
with a reduced risk|260400001|30207005
of endometriosis.[35]|129103003

While
there
is
no cure
for endometriosis,|129103003
in many people menopause|125676002|161712005
(natural|510009
or
surgical|83578000
)
will
abate
the process.|415178003

In patients|116154003
in the reproductive years,|258707000
endometriosis|129103003
is
merely
managed|119270007
:
the goal|410518001
is
to
provide
pain relief,|182970005
to
restrict|263856008
progression|246453008|246450006
of the process,|415178003
and
to
restore
or
preserve|277405005
fertility|397594008|8619003|87727006
where
needed.|410525008|103325001

In younger women|84422007|224526002
with unfulfilled reproductive potential,|30207005
surgical treatment|83578000
attempts
to
remove|127485006
endometrial tissue|2739003|85756007|278867007|85756007
and
preserving|277405005
the ovaries|15497006|83238006
without damaging normal tissue.|37782003|17621005|37782003|258744000|37782003|85756007|37782003|30389008

In general,|60132005
the diagnosis|439401001
of endometriosis|129103003
is
confirmed|59156000
during surgery,|83578000
at which time ablative steps|410669006|398298007
can
be
taken.|419652001

Further steps|46053002|398298007
depend
on circumstances
:
patients|116154003
without infertility|8619003
can
be
managed|119270007
with hormonal medication|278994005|410942007
that
suppress|245780008
the natural cycle|510009|44180009
and
pain medication,|22253000|410942007
while
infertile patients|8619003|116154003
may
be
treated|28995006
expectantly
after
surgery,|83578000
with fertility medication,|397594008|410942007|8619003|410942007|87727006|410942007
or
with IVF.|52637005

Sonography|359659005
is
a method to|260686004|272394005
monitor|13288007
recurrence|246455001
of endometriomas|116342008
during treatments.|276239002

Treatments|276239002
for endometriosis|129103003
in women|224526002
who
do
not
wish
to
become
pregnant|77386006|127362006
include|55919000
:

Procedures|71388002
are
classified|73504009
as

Conservative therapy|281131004
consists
of the excision|118292001|128303001
(called cystectomy|108034003
of the endometrium,|2739003|278867007
adhesions,|42685002
resection|118292001|128303001
of endometriomas,|116342008
and
restoration|260938008
of normal pelvic anatomy|361083003|277113001
as
much as is possible.|242762006|371930009|242762006|60022001|4757001|371930009|4757001|60022001

Laparoscopy,|108191006
besides
being
used|394850002
for diagnosis,|439401001
can
also
be
an option
for surgery.|83578000

It's
considered
a "minimally invasive" surgery|10179008|83578000
because
the surgeon|304292004
makes
very small openings|260358002|255507004|56116003
(incisions|34896006
)
at
(
or
around
)
the belly button|78220002
and
lower portion|261122009|260726005
of the belly.|29823001

A thin telescope-|18043004|277981005
like instrument|57134006
(
the laparoscope|86174004
)
is
placed|257557008|421066005
into one incision,|421379005|34896006
which
allows
the doctor to|309343006
look|386548000
for endometriosis|129103003
using|260676000
a small camera|255507004|14364002
attached|102491009
to the laparoscope.|86174004

Small instruments|255507004|57134006
are
inserted|257867005
through the incisions to|34896006
remove|127485006
the tissue|85756007
and
adhesions.|42685002

Because
the incisions|34896006
are
very small, there|260358002|255507004
will
only
be
small scars|255507004|70582006|255507004|275322007
on the skin|119325001|39937001|181469002
after the procedure.[42]|71388002

Semi-conservative therapy|281131004
preserves|277405005
a healthy appearing ovary,|263775005|15497006|263775005|83238006|263775005|181464007
but
also
increases|260366006
the risk|30207005
of recurrence.[43]|246455001

For patients|116154003
with extreme pain,|12565001|22253000
a presacral neurectomy|44850001
may
be
indicated|410535002
where the nerves|3057000
to the uterus|35039007|181452004
are
cut.|283396008

However,
strong clinical evidence|260404005|58147004|18669006
showed
that presacral neurectomy|44850001
is
more effective|242762006|255403003|242762006|254648000
in pain relief|182970005
if
the pelvic pain|30473006
is
midline|399488007|260528009
concentrated,
and
not
as effective|255403003|254648000
if
the pain|22253000
extends|255590007
to the left|7771000
and
right lower quadrants|255495000
of the abdomen.|277112006|52731004|302553009

This
is
because
the nerves to|3057000
be
transected
in the procedure|71388002
are
innervating
the central|26216008
or
the midline region|399488007|410673009|260528009|410673009
in the female pelvis.|248152002|277113001|248152002|21844003|248152002|229765004|224526002|277113001|224526002|21844003|224526002|229765004

Furthermore,
women|224526002
who
had
presacral neurectomy|44850001
have
higher prevalence|75540009|371879000
of chronic constipation|236069009
not
responding
well|20572008
to medication treatment|18629005
because of the potential injury|30207005
to the parasympathetic nerve|78390006|276146002
in the vicinity
during the procedure.|71388002

After surgical treatment|83578000
of deeply infiltrating endometriosis|47351003|129103003
with colorectal involvement,|264267007|248448006
the endometriosis recurrence rate|129103003|246455001
is
estimated to|414135002
be
10%
(ranging
between 5|264706000|264605009
and
25%
).[44]

Efficacy studies|110465008|224699009
show
that
both
medicinal
and
surgical interventions|83578000
produce
roughly equivalent pain-relief benefits.|9726003|182970005|258726008|182970005

Recurrence|246455001
of pain|22253000
was
found|404684003
to
be
44
and
53 percent|118582008
with medicinal
and
surgical interventions,|83578000
respectively.

Each approach

[45]
it
is

surgery|83578000
can

be
performed|398166005
as a minimally invasive|10179008

reduce|260400001
morbidity

minimize
the risk|30207005

The ESHRE
(European Society|414152003
for Human Reproduction|278412004

guidelines
recommend
that patient self-help groups|116154003|224879000

While
roughly similar
to medicinal interventions|225334002
in treating pain,|28995006|22253000
the efficacy
of surgery|83578000
is
especially significant|386134007
in treating infertility.|28995006|8619003

One study|421379005|110465008|421379005|224699009
has
shown
that surgical treatment|83578000
of endometriosis approximately|129103003|26175008
doubles|1305003
the fecundity|397594008
(pregnancy rate|289908002
).

In-vitro fertilization|55767001

procedures|71388002
are
effective|255403003|254648000
in improving fertility|385633008|397594008|385633008|8619003|385633008|87727006

IVF|52637005
makes

combine|20909006
sperm|6789008

The decision
when
to
apply|410618006|417924000
IVF|52637005
in endometriosis-associated infertility|129103003|47429007|8619003
takes|419652001
into
account
the age|424144002
of the patient,|116154003
the severity|272141005
of the endometriosis,|129103003
the presence|386397008
of other infertility factors,|74964007|8619003
and
the results|394617004
and
duration|103335007

Proper counseling|409063005|265913000
of patients|116154003
with endometriosis|129103003
requires
attention|6769007
to several aspects|261028005
of the disorder.|64572001

Of primary importance|63161005|261424001
is
the initial operative staging|884001|72589006|232714002|72589006
of the disease to|64572001
obtain|398092000
adequate information|51117008|88323005
on which
to base future decisions
about therapy.|276239002

The patient's symptoms|116154003
and
desire
for childbearing dictate appropriate therapy.|276239002

Not
all therapy|276239002
works|261041009
for all patients.|116154003

Some patients|116154003
have
recurrences|246455001
after surgery|83578000
or
pseudo-menopause.|64100000|161712005

In most cases,|398241000|413769002
treatment|276239002|416118004
will
give|419582001
patients significant relief|116154003|386134007|224978009
from pelvic pain|30473006
and
assist|116697009|119265000
them
in achieving pregnancy.[49]|289908002

The underlying process|415178003
that
causes|134198009
endometriosis|129103003
may
not
cease
after surgical|83578000
or
medical intervention.|74188005|225334002

Studies|110465008|224699009
have
shown
that endometriosis|129103003
recurs|246455001
at a rate
of 20
to 40 percent|259031006|118582008
within five years|421820001|258707000
following|255260001
conservative surgery,|83578000
[50]
unless
hysterectomy|236886002
is
performed|398166005
or
menopause|161712005
reached.|282679008

Monitoring|302805002
of patients|116154003
consists
of periodic clinical examinations|81591007|5880005
and
sonography.|359659005

Vaginal childbirth|76784001|169836001|169836001
decreases|260370003
recurrence|246455001
of endometriosis.|129103003

In contrast,
endometriosis recurrence rates|129103003|246455001
have
been
shown
to
be
higher|75540009|371879000
in women|224526002
who
have
not given birth vaginally,|3950001
such as
in Cesarean section.[51]|11466000

Endometriosis|129103003
can
affect|4065008
any female,|248152002|224526002
from premenarche
to postmenopause,|76498008
regardless of race|415229000
or
ethnicity|397731000
or
whether
or
not
they
have
had
children.|410601007|160499008

It
is
primarily
a disease|64572001
of the reproductive years.|258707000

Its prevalence
varies
,
but
6?10%
is
a reasonable number,|410666004|410680006|410666004|410681005
more common|242762006|72906007
in women|224526002
with infertility|8619003
and
chronic pelvic pain|237067000
(35?50%
).[1]|260305007

As an estrogen-dependent process,|61946003|371154000|415178003
it
can
persist
beyond menopause|161712005
and
persists
in
up to 40%|259031006
of patients|116154003
following|255260001
hysterectomy.|236886002

In some cases,|398241000|413769002
it
may
also
begin|255395001
beyond menopause|161712005

it
has
also
been
described
