*Appendicitis|74400008|85189001
*
*
is
a condition|260905004
characterized
by inflammation|257552002
of the appendix.|66754008|181255000

It
is
classified|73504009
as a medical emergency|74188005|25876001
and
many cases|260396001|398241000|260396001|413769002
require
removal|118292001|128303001
of the inflamed appendix,|66754008|181255000
either
by laparotomy|86481000
or
laparoscopy.|108191006

Untreated|25265005
,
mortality|409651001
is
high, mainly|75540009|371879000
because of the risk|30207005
of rupture|415747007
leading|236874000
to peritonitis|48661000
and
shock.|27942005

Reginald Fitz
first
described acute|272118002
and
chronic appendicitis|58997001
in 1886,
[2]|260306008
and
it
has
been
recognized
as one|421379005
of the most common causes|4757001|72906007|134198009
of severe acute abdominal pain worldwide.|24484000|116290004

A correctly
diagnosed|439401001
non-acute form|272118002|246176004
of appendicitis|74400008|85189001
is
known|36692007
as "rumbling appendicitis".[3]|74400008|85189001

The term "pseudoappendicitis"
is
used to|394850002
describe
a condition mimicking appendicitis.|260905004|74400008|260905004|85189001

It
can
be
associated|47429007
with _Yersinia enterocolitica_.[5]|65255000

Pain first,|22253000|255216001|22253000|232714002
vomiting|249497008
next|18769003|255260001
and
fever|386661006
last
has
been
described
as the classic presentation|255301002|246105001|255333006|246105001
of acute appendicitis.|85189001

Since
the innervation|260917002|66332009
of the appendix|66754008|181255000
enters|417985001
the spinal cord|2748008|180959008
at the level T10,|258395000|276625007
the same level|262126009|258395000|262126009|276625007
as the umbilicus|78220002|265800007
(belly button|78220002
)
,
the pain|22253000
begins|255395001
mid-abdomen.

Later,
as
the appendix|66754008|181255000
becomes
more
inflamed
and
irritates
the adjoining abdominal wall,|83908009|181613000
it
tends
to
localize|255471002
over several hours|261028005|258702006
into the right lower quadrant,|255495000
except
in children|410601007|160499008
under three years.|421291004|258707000

This pain|22253000
can
be
elicited|263516000
through various signs|256220008|72670004
and
can
be
severe.|24484000

Signs|72670004
include|55919000
localized findings|255471002|404684003|255471002
in the right iliac fossa.|243963000

The abdominal wall|83908009|181613000
becomes
very sensitive|260358002|83185005
to gentle pressure|279046003|13543005|257893003
(palpation.|113011001

Also,
there
is
severe pain|76948002
on sudden release|255363002|58000006|255363002|68776005|255363002|258760001|255363002|129299003|255363002|115956009
of deep pressure|131197000|279046003|131197000|13543005|131197000|257893003
in the lower abdomen|27033000
(rebound tenderness.|35611005

In case|398241000
of a retrocecal appendix|80114002|264641009
(appendix|66754008|181255000
localized|255471002
behind the cecum,|32713005|181256004
however,
even deep pressure|131197000|279046003|131197000|13543005|131197000|257893003
in the right lower quadrant|255495000
may
fail
to
elicit|263516000
tenderness|247348008
(silent appendix|263872000|66754008|263872000|181255000
)
,
the reason|410666004
being
that
the cecum,|32713005|181256004
distended|255381004
with gas,|308698004|74947009
protects
the inflamed appendix|66754008|181255000
from the pressure.|279046003|13543005|257893003

Similarly,
if
the appendix|66754008|181255000
lies|40199007|255576009
entirely
within the pelvis,|277113001|21844003|229765004
there
is
usually
complete|255594003
absence|2667000|418560003
of abdominal rigidity.|72300008

In such cases,|398241000|413769002
a digital rectal examination|410007005|410006001
elicits|263516000
tenderness|247348008
in the rectovesical pouch.|85481009|261416006

Coughing causes|272039006|134198009
point
tenderness|247348008
in this area|42798000
(McBurney's point
and
this
is
the least painful way to|276139006|22253000|263796003|22253000
localize|255471002
the inflamed appendix.|66754008|181255000

If
the abdomen|277112006|52731004|302553009
on palpation|113011001
is
also involuntarily
guarded|250072004
(rigid|16046003|261026009
)
,
there
should
be
a strong suspicion|260404005|22927000
of peritonitis,|48661000
requiring
urgent surgical intervention.[6]|103391001|83578000

On the basis|418836005
of experimental evidence,|18669006
acute appendicitis|85189001
seems
to
be
the end result|261782000|394617004|422117008|394617004
of a primary obstruction|63161005|26036001|261424001|26036001
of the appendix lumen|66754008|113342003|66754008|342806003|66754008|398252006|181255000|113342003|181255000|342806003|181255000|398252006
(
the
inside space
of a tubular structure|95568003|13336003
).

Once this obstruction|26036001
occurs|272120004
,
the appendix subsequently|66754008|181255000
becomes
filled
with mucus|49909006
and
swells,|423666004
increasing|260369004
pressures|279046003|13543005
within the lumen|113342003|342806003|398252006
and
the walls|224727009
of the appendix,|66754008|181255000
resulting|42752001
in thrombosis|118927008
and
occlusion|25272006|26036001|257885003|263823007
of the small vessels,|27915009|340264000
and
stasis|19685008
of lymphatic flow.|83555006

Rarely,|103356009
spontaneous recovery|50289004
can
occur|272120004
at this point.

As the former progresses,|9130008|385651009
the appendix|66754008|181255000
becomes
ischemic|255426005
and
then necrotic.|6574001

As bacteria|409822003
begin|255395001
to
leak|87952002
out
through the dying walls,|399069006|224727009
pus|11311000|119323008
forms|246176004
within
and
around the appendix|66754008|181255000
(suppuration|41034006
).

The end result|261782000|394617004|422117008|394617004
of this cascade
is
appendiceal rupture|47693006
(
a 'burst appendix'|255331008|66754008|255331008|181255000
)
causing peritonitis,|23981006|48661000
which
may
lead|88488004
to septicemia|105592009
and
eventually death.|419620001|268923008

The causative agents|362944004
include|55919000
foreign bodies,|125670008
trauma,
intestinal worms,|261093006|27601005|261093006|26089000
lymphadenitis,|19471005
and
,
most commonly,
calcified
fecal deposits|39477002|46595003
known|36692007
as appendicoliths
or
fecaliths[9]|89158005
The occurrence|272120004
of obstructing fecaliths|263821009|89158005
has
attracted attention|6769007
since
their presence|386397008
in patients|116154003
with appendicitis|74400008|85189001
is
significantly higher|75540009|371879000
in developed
than
in developing countries,|223369002
[10]
and
an appendiceal fecalith|286609007
is
commonly
associated|47429007
with complicated appendicitis.|418171008

Also,
fecal stasis|39477002|19685008
and
arrest|397829000|6155003
may
play|300776002
a role,
as
demonstrated
by a significantly lower number|261122009|410680006|261122009|410681005
of bowel movements|111989001
per week|258705008|259038000
in patients|116154003
with acute appendicitis|85189001
compared
with healthy controls.|263775005|31509003

The occurrence|272120004
of a fecalith|89158005
in the appendix|66754008|181255000
seems
to
be
attributed|246061005
to a right-sided fecal retention reservoir|24028007|39477002|36850000|257687008|264180000|39477002|36850000|257687008
in the colon|263977005|302508007
and
a prolonged transit time.|255224006|398101002|410669006

From epidemiological data,
it
has
been
stated|398070004
that diverticular disease|63532004
and
adenomatous polyps|82375006
were
unknown|261665006
and
colon cancer|363406005|269533000
exceedingly rare|84638005|103356009
in communities|133928008
exempt
from appendicitis.|74400008|85189001

Also,
acute appendicitis|85189001
has
been
shown
to
occur|272120004
antecedent
to cancer|363346000|372087000
in the colon|263977005|302508007
and
rectum.|34402009|181261002

Several studies|261028005|110465008|261028005|224699009
offer|410527000
evidence|18669006
that
a low fiber intake|62482003|116272000|62482003|400293002|62482003|87028007|62482003|37202001|371880002|116272000|371880002|400293002|371880002|87028007|371880002|37202001
is
involved|248448006
in the pathogenesis|303109001
of appendicitis.|74400008|85189001

This
is
in accordance
with the occurrence|272120004
of a right-sided fecal reservoir|24028007|39477002|257687008|264180000|39477002|257687008
and
the fact
that dietary fiber|116272000
reduces|260400001
transit time.[20]|398101002|410669006

Diagnosis|439401001
is
based|418836005
on patient history|116154003|116154003|392521001
(symptoms
)
and
physical examination|5880005
backed|123961009|255551008|281213008|302552004|77568009
by an elevation|103720008|255456001
of neutrophilic white blood cells.|116712007|767002|116712007|52501007|414850009|767002|414850009|52501007

Histories|392521001
fall|1912002
into two categories,|420797005
typical
and
atypical.|112231000

Typical appendicitis usually|74400008|85189001
includes|55919000
abdominal pain beginning|21522001|255395001
in the region|410673009
of the umbilicus|78220002|265800007
for several hours,|261028005|258702006
associated|47429007
with anorexia,
nausea|422587007
or
vomiting.|249497008

The pain then "settles"|22253000|128719006
into the right lower quadrant|255495000
(
or
the left lower quadrant|255480002
in patients|116154003
with situs inversus totalis,|24614000
where tenderness|247348008
develops.

A commonly used acronym|394850002
for diagnosis|439401001
is
PALF
:
pain,|22253000
anorexia,
leukocytosis,|414478003
and
fever.|386661006

Atypical histories|112231000|112231000|392521001
lack|41277001
this typical progression|246453008|246450006
and
may
include|55919000
pain|22253000
in the right lower quadrant|255495000
as an initial symptom.|884001|232714002

Atypical histories often|112231000|70232002|112231000|392521001|70232002
require
imaging|363679005|278395004
with ultrasound|359659005
and/or
CT scanning.|77477000

A pregnancy test|74036000
is
vital|260410005
in all women|224526002
of child bearing age,|410601007|106970005|424144002|410601007|81827009|424144002|410601007|398209006|424144002|160499008|106970005|424144002|160499008|81827009|424144002|160499008|398209006|424144002
as
ectopic pregnancies|34801009
and
appendicitis|74400008|85189001
present|52101004|246105001
similar symptoms.

The consequences|103332005
of missing
an ectopic pregnancy|34801009
are
serious,|42745003
and
potentially life threatening.|224130005

Furthermore
the general principles|60132005
of approaching abdominal pain|21522001
in women|224526002
(
in so much|223528007
that
it
is
different|263735002
from the approach
in men|339947000
)
should
be
appreciated.

Increased pain|35105006|22253000|260366006|22253000
on palpation|113011001
with finger|7569003|302541005
in right Petit triangle|24028007|278828001
(
can
be
a positive Shchetkin-Bloomberg's sign|258758003|72670004|10828004|72670004
) -

of the pressure|279046003|13543005|257893003
causes|134198009
the severe pain|76948002
on the site|10546003
indicating|410535002
positive Blumberg's sign|258758003|72670004|10828004|72670004
and
peritonitis.[23]|48661000|264657009

Increased pain|35105006|22253000|260366006|22253000
on palpation|113011001
at the right iliac region|37117007
as patient|116154003
lies|40199007|255576009
on his/
her left side|7771000
compared to
when
patient|116154003
was
on supine position.|40199007

Increased pain|35105006|22253000|260366006|22253000
in the right lower quadrant|255495000
with coughing.[24]|272039006

From the history|392521001
given|419582001
,
the appearance|386548000|255412001
of pain|22253000
in the epigastric region|27947004
or
around the stomach|69695003|181246003
at the beginning|255395001
of disease|64572001
with a subsequent shift|255260001|9546005
to the right iliac region.|37117007

This sign,|72670004
developed
in
and
popular
in southwest England,|223664003
describes
a firm swish|20583004|421805007
of the examiner?s index|419205000

from xiphoid sternum|56873002|302522007
to first|255216001|232714002
the left|7771000
and
then
the right iliac fossa.|243963000

A positive Massouh sign|258758003|72670004|10828004|72670004
is
a grimace|39960009
of the patient|116154003
upon a right sided|24028007|264180000
(
and
not left|7771000
)
sweep,
because
initial stage appendicitis usually|884001|21191007|74400008|884001|21191007|85189001|884001|371508000|74400008|884001|371508000|85189001|884001|261612004|74400008|884001|261612004|85189001|232714002|21191007|74400008|232714002|21191007|85189001|232714002|371508000|74400008|232714002|371508000|85189001|232714002|261612004|74400008|232714002|261612004|85189001
causes|134198009
localised irritation|255471002|257553007
of the well-innervated peritoneum.|20572008|15425007

If
an inflamed appendix|66754008|181255000
is
in contact|52101004|11723008|52101004|70862002|18720000|11723008|18720000|70862002
with the obturator internus,|82115007|245025008
spasm|45352006
of the muscle|91727004
(
called
the obturator sign|6292008
can
be
demonstrated
by flexing|9964006
and
internal rotation|257913003
of the hip.|29836001|85710004

This maneuver
will
cause|23981006|134198009
pain|22253000
in the hypogastrium.|11708003

Psoas sign|77069005
or
"Obraztsova's sign"|72670004
is
right lower-quadrant pain|301754002
that
is
produced
with
either
the passive extension|255536004
of the patient's right hip|116154003|287579007|116154003|91776005
(patient lying|116154003|40199007|116154003|255576009
on left side,|7771000
with knee|304679005|49076000|361291001|72696002
in flexion|9964006
)
or
by the patient's active flexion|116154003|55561003|9964006
of the right hip|287579007|91776005
while
supine.|40199007

The pain|22253000
elicited|263516000
is
due to inflammation|257552002
of the peritoneum|15425007
overlying|255547006
the iliopsoas muscles|68455001
and
inflammation|257552002
of the psoas muscles|36278009
themselves.

Straightening out
the leg|61685007|30021000|182281004|362793004
causes|134198009
pain|22253000
because
it
stretches|386781001
these muscles,|91727004
while
flexing|9964006
the hip|29836001|85710004
activates
the iliopsoas|68455001|181668001
and
therefore also
causes|134198009
pain.|22253000

Continuous deep palpation starting|255238004|51558006|255395001|255238004|51558006|385652002
from the left iliac fossa upwards|243964006
(counterclockwise
along the colon|263977005|302508007
)
may
cause|23981006|134198009
pain|22253000
in the right iliac fossa,|243963000
by pushing bowel contents|420620005|261093006|276824008
towards the ileocaecal valve|23153004
and
thus
increasing|260369004
pressure|279046003|13543005|257893003
around the appendix.[25]|66754008|181255000

Increased pain|35105006|22253000|260366006|22253000
in the right iliac region|37117007
as patient|116154003
lies|40199007|255576009
on his/
her left side.|7771000

Most people|125676002
suspected|415684004
of
having
appendicitis|74400008|85189001
would
be
asked
to do
a blood test.|252275004

Half
of the time,|410669006
the blood test|252275004
is
normal,|17621005|258744000
so
it
is
not
that useful
in diagnosing appendicitis.|439401001|74400008|439401001|85189001

Two forms|420797005|246176004
of blood tests|252275004
are
commonly
done
:
Full blood count (FBC),|26604007
also
known|36692007
as complete blood count (CBC),|26604007
is
an inexpensive
and
commonly requested blood test.|385644000|252275004|385644000

It
involves|248448006
measuring|258104002|263571004
the blood|87612001|119273009
for its richness|224166006
in red blood cells,|14089001|41898006|258759006|126242007
as well as
the number|410680006|410681005
of the various white blood cell constituents|256220008|52501007|312297002
in it.

The number|410680006|410681005
of white cells|52501007
in the blood|87612001|119273009
is
usually less
than 10,000 cells|4421005
per cubic millimeter.|258774008

An abnormal rise|263654008
in the number|410680006|410681005
of white blood cells|767002|52501007
in the blood|87612001|119273009
is
a crude indicator
of infection
or
inflammation|257552002
going
on
in the body.|279495008|123037004

Such
a rise
is
not specific|69658003
to appendicitis|74400008|85189001
alone.|105529008

If
it
is
abnormally
elevated|75540009
,
with a good history|20572008|20572008|392521001
and
examination findings|271906008
pointing
towards appendicitis,|74400008|85189001
the likelihood|2931005
of
having
the disease|64572001
is
higher.|75540009|371879000

In pregnancy,|289908002
elevation|103720008|255456001
of white blood cells|767002|52501007
may
be
normal,|17621005|258744000
without any infection present.|52101004|246105001

C-reactive protein (CRP)|61425002|55235003
is
an acute-phase response protein|91309004
produced
by the liver|10200004|181268008
in response
to any infection
or
inflammatory process|415178003
in the body.|279495008|123037004

Again,
like the FBC,|26604007
it
is
not
a specific test.|69658003|269814003|69658003|69658003|272393004

It
is
another crude marker
of infection
or
inflammation.|257552002

Inflammation|257552002
at ANY site|10546003
can
lead|88488004
to a rise
in CRP.|128200000

A significant rise|386134007
in CRP,|128200000
with corresponding signs|72670004
and
symptoms
of appendicitis,|74400008|85189001
is
a useful indicator
in the diagnosis|439401001
of appendicitis.|74400008|85189001

If
the CRP|128200000
continues|255238004
to
be
normal|17621005|258744000
after 72 hours|123028004
of the onset|77374008
of pain,|22253000
the appendicitis likely|74400008|2931005|85189001|2931005
will
resolve
on its own
without intervention.|225334002

A worsening CRP|230993007|128200000|231877006|128200000
with good history|20572008|20572008|392521001
is
a sure signal
of impending perforation|71033007|263837003
or
rupture|415747007
and
abscess formation.|128477000|11798007|128477000|255277001

A urine test|167217005
in appendicitis|74400008|85189001
is
usually normal.|17621005|258744000

It
may
,
however,
show
blood|87612001|119273009
if
the appendix|66754008|181255000
is
rubbing
on the bladder,|89837001|302512001
causing|23981006
irritation.|257553007

It
is
important to
rule|10828004
out
an ectopic pregnancy|34801009
in women|224526002
of childbearing age.|424144002

Appendicitis|74400008|85189001
in children|410601007|160499008
is
common enough to|72906007
merit
special attention.|67995009|6769007

Because of the health|263775005
risks|30207005
of exposing children|24932003|410601007|24932003|160499008
to radiation,|30821001|82107009|108290001
many medical societies|74188005
recommend
that
in confirming|59156000
a diagnosis|439401001
with children|410601007|160499008
the ultrasound|359659005
is
a preferred first choice|225773000|255216001|225773000|232714002
with x-rays|52250000|168537006
being
a legitimate
follow-up|308273005
when
warranted.

CT scan|77477000
is
more accurate|242762006|263656005
than ultrasound|359659005
for the diagnosis|439401001
of appendicitis|74400008|85189001
in adults|133936004
and
adolescents.|133937008

CT scan|77477000
has
a sensitivity|35209006|365705006
of 94%,
specificity|69658003
of 95%.

Ultrasonography|359659005
had
an overall sensitivity|35209006|365705006
of 86%,
a specificity|69658003
of 81%.[29]

In 10%
of patients|116154003
with appendicitis,|74400008|85189001
plain abdominal X-ray|60654006
may
demonstrate
hard formed feces|75295004|35810008
in the lumen|113342003|342806003|398252006
of the appendix|66754008|181255000
(fecolith
).

It
is
agreed
that
the finding|404684003
of Fecolith
in the appendix|66754008|181255000
on X-ray|52250000|168537006|363680008
alone|105529008
is
a reason to|410666004
operate
to
remove|127485006
the appendix,|66754008|181255000
because of the potential to|30207005
cause|23981006|134198009
worsening symptoms.|230993007|231877006

In this respect,
a plain abdominal X-ray|60654006
may
be
useful
in the diagnosis|439401001
of appendicitis,|74400008|85189001
though
plain abdominal X- ray|60654006
is
no longer|255511005
requested routinely|385644000
in suspected cases|398241000|413769002|415684004|398241000|415684004|413769002
of appendicitis.|74400008|85189001

An abdominal X-ray|60654006
may
be
done
with a barium enema|265068003
contrast|263543005
to
diagnose|439401001
appendicitis.|74400008|85189001

Barium enema|265068003
is
whitish fluid|32457005|33463005|255765007
that
is
passed
up
into the rectum to|34402009|181261002
act
as a contrast.

It
will
usually
fill
the whole|260232004
of the large bowel.|14742008

In normal appendix,|17621005|66754008|17621005|181255000|258744000|66754008|258744000|181255000
the lumen|113342003|342806003|398252006
will
be
present|52101004|246105001
and
the barium fills|426728000
it
up
and
is
seen
when
the X-ray film|52250000|168537006|363680008
is
shot.|28289002

In appendicitis,|74400008|85189001
the lumen|113342003|342806003|398252006
of the appendix|66754008|181255000
will
not
be
visible|24054004
on the barium film.|426728000

Ultrasonography|359659005
and
Doppler sonography|268447006|359659005
provide
useful means to|255586005
detect|260373001
appendicitis,|74400008|85189001
especially
in children,|410601007|160499008
and
shows
free fluid collection|41699000
in the right iliac fossa,|243963000
along
with a visible appendix|24054004|66754008|24054004|181255000
without blood flow|58190003
in color Doppler.|263714004|268447006

In some cases|398241000|413769002
(15% approximately|26175008
)
,
however,
ultrasonography|359659005
of the iliac fossa|8412003|182341009
does
not
reveal|263857004
any abnormalities|276654001
despite the presence|386397008
of appendicitis.|74400008|85189001

This
is
especially true|31874001
of early appendicitis|264499004|74400008|264499004|85189001
before the appendix|66754008|181255000
has
become
significantly
distended|255381004
and
in adults|133936004
where larger amounts|255509001|107651007|263768009|107651007
of fat|271590003
and
bowel gas|261093006|308698004|261093006|74947009
make
actually
seeing|281004000
the appendix|66754008|181255000
technically difficult|52925006
.

Despite these limitations,|246175000
sonographic|359659005
imaging|363679005|278395004
in experienced hands|85562004
can
often|70232002
distinguish
between appendicitis|74400008|85189001
and
other diseases|74964007|64572001
with very similar symptoms,|260358002
such as inflammation|257552002
of lymph nodes|59441001
near the appendix|66754008|181255000
or
pain originating|22253000
from other pelvic organs|74964007|8279000
such as the ovaries|15497006|83238006
or
fallopian tubes.|414982008

Where
it
is
readily available, CT scan|103328004|77477000
has
become
frequently|70232002
used|394850002
,
especially
in adults|133936004
whose diagnosis|439401001
is
not obvious
on history|392521001
and
physical examination.|5880005

Concerns
about radiation,|30821001|82107009|108290001
however,
tend
to
limit|255469002
use|277889008|419385000
of CT
in pregnant women|255409004
and
children.|410601007|160499008

A properly performed CT scan|398166005|77477000
with modern equipment|246137000
has
a detection rate
(sensitivity|35209006|365705006
)
of over 95%,|21481007
and
a similar specificity.|69658003

Signs|72670004
of appendicitis|74400008|85189001
on CT scan|77477000
include|55919000
lack|41277001
of oral contrast|260548002
(oral dye|260548002|61789006
)
in the appendix,|66754008|181255000
direct visualization|255589003
of appendiceal enlargement|66754008|56246009|66754008|118452000|66754008|442021009|181255000|56246009|181255000|118452000|181255000|442021009
(greater|263768009
than 6 mm
in cross-sectional diameter|65145006|62083003|81827009
)
,
and
appendiceal wall enhancement|66754008|224727009|418393006|181255000|224727009|418393006
with IV contrast
(IV dye|61789006
).

The inflammation|257552002
caused|23981006|134198009
by appendicitis|74400008|85189001
in the surrounding peritoneal fat|355648006|15425007|271590003|355648006|264143006|271590003
(so called "fat stranding"|223528007|271590003
)
can
also
be
observed
on CT,
providing
a mechanism to|257544000
detect|260373001
early appendicitis|264499004|74400008|264499004|85189001
and
a clue
that appendicitis|74400008|85189001
may
be
present|52101004|246105001
even
when
the appendix|66754008|181255000
is
not well|20572008
seen.

Thus,
diagnosis|439401001
of appendicitis|74400008|85189001
by CT
is
made more difficult|52925006
in very thin patients|260358002|18043004|116154003
and
in children,|410601007|160499008
both
of whom
tend
to
lack|41277001
significant fat|386134007|271590003
within the abdomen.|277112006|52731004|302553009

The utility|225927009
of CT scanning|77477000
is
made
clear|263707001
,
however,
by the impact|134293005
it
has
had
on negative appendectomy rates.|260385009|80146002

For example,
use|277889008|419385000
of CT
for diagnosis|439401001
of appendicitis|74400008|85189001
in Boston,
MA
has
decreased|1250004|260400001|260371004
the chance
of finding|404684003
a normal appendix|17621005|66754008|17621005|181255000|258744000|66754008|258744000|181255000
at surgery|83578000
from 20%
in the pre-CT era|236874000|272113006
to only 3%|50607009|420295001
according to data
from the Massachusetts General Hospital.|224066008|60132005|224066008|60132005|285201006

A number|410680006|410681005
of clinical|58147004
and
laboratory-based scoring systems|261904005|278061009|246333005|261904005|418836005|278061009|246333005
have
been
devised
to
assist|116697009|119265000
diagnosis.|439401001

The most widely|4757001
used|394850002
is
Alvarado score.|278061009

A score|278061009
below 5|264706000|264605009
is
strongly
against a diagnosis|439401001
of appendicitis,|74400008|85189001
[30]
while
a score|278061009
of 7
or
more
is
strongly predictive
of acute appendicitis.|85189001

In patients|116154003
with an equivocal score|42425007|278061009
of 5
or
6,
a CT scan|77477000
is
used to further|394850002|46053002
reduce|260400001
the rate
of negative appendicectomy.|260385009|80146002

Tzanakis scoring|278061009
:
Tzanakis
and
colleagues,
in 2005
published
a simplified system,|246333005
now
called
the Tzanakis
scoring|278061009
system|246333005
for appendicitis,|74400008|85189001
to
aid|246088000
the diagnosis|439401001
of appendicitis.|74400008|85189001

It
incorporates
the presence|386397008
of four variables|421534005|255372005
made up|255532002|353734004
of specific signs|69658003|72670004
and
symptoms

the presence|386397008
of appendicitis.|74400008|85189001

The definitive diagnosis|261002007|439401001|261002007
is
based|418836005
on pathology.|394595002

The histologic findings|263540008
of appendicits
are
neutrophils|116712007
in the muscularis propria.|86915006

Periappendicits,
inflammation|257552002
of tissues|85756007
around the appendix,|66754008|181255000
is
often|70232002
found|404684003
in conjunction with other abdominal pathology.[31]|74964007|277112006|394595002|264664006

Acute appendicitis|85189001
is
typically
managed|119270007
by surgery however|83578000
in uncomplicated cases antibiotics|263914008|398241000|255631004|263914008|413769002|255631004
are
both
effective|255403003|254648000
and
safe.

While
antibiotics|255631004
are
effective|255403003|254648000
for treating uncomplicated appendicitis 20%|28995006|263914008|74400008|28995006|263914008|85189001
of people|125676002
had
a recurrence|246455001
within a year|258707000|259039008
and
required eventual appendectomy.[32]|80146002

Pain medications|22253000|410942007
(
such as morphine|373529000|442759006
do
not
appear
to
affect|4065008
the accuracy|263656005
of the clinical diagnosis|39154008
of appendicitis|74400008|85189001
and
therefore
should
be
given|419582001
early|264499004
in the persons|125676002
care.

Historically there
were
concerns
among some general surgeons|78703002
that analgesics|373265006
would
affect|4065008
the clinical exam|58147004|225886003
in children|410601007|160499008
and
thus
some
recommended
that
they
not
be
given|419582001
until the surgeon|304292004
in question|42425007
was
able to|371150009
examine|64049009
the person|125676002
for themselves.[33]|264667004

The surgical procedure|83578000
for the removal|118292001|128303001
of the appendix|66754008|181255000
is
called
an appendicectomy.|80146002

Laparoscopic removal|108191006|118292001|108191006|128303001|118292001|128303001
(
via three small incisions|421291004|255507004|34896006
with a camera to|14364002
visualize|255374006
the area|42798000
of interest|225469004
in the abdomen|277112006|52731004|302553009
)
seem
to
have
some advantages
over an open procedures especially|56116003|71388002
in young females|84422007|248152002
and
the obese.[34]|414915002

Laparotomy|86481000
is
the traditional type|263901007|261664005
of surgery|83578000
used|394850002
for treating appendicitis.|28995006|74400008|28995006|85189001

This procedure|71388002
consists
in the removal|118292001|128303001
of the infected appendix|66754008|181255000
through a single larger incision|125681006|255509001|34896006|125681006|263768009|34896006|50607009|255509001|34896006|50607009|263768009|34896006
in the lower right area|261122009|24028007|42798000
of the abdomen.|277112006|52731004|302553009

The incision|34896006
in a laparotomy|86481000
is
usually 2-3 inches|258677007
long.|255511005

This type|261664005
of surgery|83578000
is
used also|394850002
for visualizing|255374006
and
examining structures|64049009
inside the abdominal cavity|52731004|361294009
and
it
is
called exploratory laparotomy.|74770008

During a traditional appendectomy procedure,|263901007|80146002
the patient|116154003
is
placed|257557008|421066005
under general anesthesia to|50697003
keep
the muscles completely|91727004
relaxed|15166001
and
to
keep
the patient|116154003
unconscious.|418107008

The incision|34896006
is
two|420797005
to three inches|421291004|258677007
(76 mm
)
long|255511005
and
it
is
made
in the right lower abdomen,|24028007|27033000
several inches|261028005|258677007
above the hip bone.|28254004

Once the incision|34896006
opens|56116003
the abdomen cavity|52731004|361294009
and
the appendix|66754008|181255000
is
identified,|7882003
the surgeon|304292004
removes|127485006
the infected tissue|85756007
and
cuts|283396008
the appendix|66754008|181255000
from the surrounding tissue.|355648006|85756007

After the surgeon inspects carefully|304292004
and
closely
the infected area|42798000
and
there
are
no signs|72670004
that surrounding tissues|355648006|85756007
are
damaged|37782003
or
infected,
he
will
start|255395001
closing|29179001
the incision.|34896006

This means|255586005
sewing
the muscles|91727004
and
using|260676000
surgical staples|386014009
or
stitches
to
close|29179001
the skin|119325001|39937001|181469002
up.

In order to
prevent
infections
the incision|34896006
is
covered|255334000
with a sterile bandage.|261029002|63995005|15296000|63995005

The entire procedure|255503000|71388002|260232004|71388002
does
not
last
longer|255511005
than an hour|258702006|286551008
if
complications|116223007
do
not
occur.|272120004

The newer method to|7147002|260686004|7147002|272394005
treat|395077000
appendicitis|74400008|85189001
is
the laparoscopic surgery.|108191006|83578000|83578000

This surgical procedure|83578000
consists
of making three|421291004
to four incisions|421534005|34896006
in the abdomen,|277112006|52731004|302553009
each 0.25
to 0.5 inches|260316000|258677007
(6.3|419268000
to 13 mm
)
long.|255511005

This type|261664005
of appendectomy|80146002
is
made
by inserting|257867005|421532009
a special surgical tool|67995009|83578000|86967005
called
laparoscope|86174004
into one|421379005
of the incisions.|34896006

The laparoscope|86174004
is
connected
to a monitor|13288007
outside the patient's body|116154003|279495008|116154003|123037004
and
it
is
designed to
help
the surgeon to|304292004
inspect
the infected area|42798000
in the abdomen.|277112006|52731004|302553009

The other two incisions|74964007|420797005|34896006
are
made
for the specific removal|69658003|118292001|69658003|128303001
of the appendix|66754008|181255000
by
using|260676000
surgical instruments.|37759000

Laparoscopic surgery also|108191006|83578000|83578000
requires
general anesthesia|50697003
and
it
can
last
up to two hours.|420797005|258702006

The latest methods|260383002|260686004|260383002|272394005
are
NOTES
appendectomy|80146002
pioneered
in Coimbatore,
India|223600005
where there
is
no incision|34896006
on the external skin[37]|261074009|119325001|261074009|39937001|261074009|181469002
and
SILS|24253004
(Single incision laparoscopic Surgery|125681006|34896006|108191006|83578000|125681006|34896006|83578000|50607009|34896006|108191006|83578000|50607009|34896006|83578000
)
where a single 2.5 cm incision|125681006|34896006|50607009|34896006
is
made to
perform|398166005
the surgery.|83578000

The treatment|276239002|416118004
begins|255395001
by keeping
the patient|116154003
from eating|48263008
or
drinking|160573003|30953006
in preparation|225106003
for surgery.|83578000

An intravenous drip|226898001|255560000|226898001
is
used to|394850002
hydrate
the patient.|116154003

Antibiotics|255631004
given|419582001
intravenously
such as cefuroxime|372833007
and
metronidazole|372602008
may
be
administered|418283001
early to|264499004
help
kill bacteria|248007002|409822003
and
thus
reduce|260400001
the
spread|410677005
of infection
in the abdomen|277112006|52731004|302553009
and
postoperative complications|385486001
in the abdomen|277112006|52731004|302553009
or
wound.|13924000

Equivocal cases|42425007|398241000|42425007|413769002
may
become
more difficult to|242762006|52925006
assess
with antibiotic treatment|255631004|276239002|255631004|416118004
and
benefit
from serial examinations.|5880005

If
the stomach|69695003|181246003
is
empty
(
no food|255620007
in the past six hours|410513005|422218008|258702006
)
general anaesthesia|50697003
is
usually
used.|394850002

Otherwise,
spinal anaesthesia|231249005
may
be
used.|394850002

Once the decision to
perform|398166005
an appendectomy|80146002
has
been
made
,
the preparation procedure|443425001
takes|419652001
more
or
less
one|421379005
to two hours.|420797005|258702006

Meanwhile,
the surgeon|304292004
will
explain
the surgery procedure|83578000
and
will
present|52101004|246105001
the risks|30207005
that
must
be
considered
when
performing|398166005
an appendectomy.|80146002

With all surgeries there|83578000
are
certain risks|17162000|30207005
that
must
be
evaluated
before performing|398166005
the procedures.|71388002

However,
the risks|30207005
are
different|263735002
depending
on the state|398070004
of the appendix.|66754008|181255000

If
the appendix|66754008|181255000
has
not
ruptured|415747007|263862003
,
the complication rate|116223007|263718001
is
only about 3%|50607009|420295001
but
if
the appendix|66754008|181255000
has
ruptured|415747007|263862003
,
the complication rate|116223007|263718001
rises
to almost 59%.

The most usual complications|4757001|116223007
that
can
occur|272120004
are
pneumonia,|205237003
hernia|414403008
of the incision,|34896006
thrombophlebitis,|64156001
bleeding|131148009
or
adhesions.|42685002

Recent evidence|6493001|18669006
indicates|410535002
that
a delay
in obtaining surgery|398092000|83578000
after admission|32485007
results|394617004
in no measurable difference|263735002
in patient outcomes.[39]|116154003|394617004

The surgeon|304292004
will
also
explain
how long|255511005
the recovery process|415178003
should
take.|419652001

Abdomen hair|277112006|386045008|277112006|119326000|52731004|386045008|52731004|119326000|302553009|386045008|302553009|119326000
is
usually
removed|127485006
in order to
avoid
complications|116223007
that
may
appear
regarding
the incision.|34896006

In most
of the cases patients|398241000|116154003|413769002|116154003
experience
nausea|422587007
or
vomiting|249497008
which
requires
specific medication|69658003|410942007
before surgery.|83578000

Antibiotics|255631004
along
with pain medication|22253000|410942007
may
also
be
administrated
prior to appendectomies.|80146002

Hospital lengths|410668003|285201006|410668003
of stay typically range
from a few hours|57176003|258702006
to a few days,|57176003|258703001
but
can
be
a few weeks|57176003|258705008
if
complications|116223007
occur.|272120004

The recovery process|415178003
may
vary
depending
on the severity|272141005
of the condition,|260905004
if
the appendix|66754008|181255000
had
ruptured|415747007|263862003
or
not
before
surgery.|83578000

Appendix surgery recovery|66754008|83578000|181255000|83578000
is
generally
a lot
faster|16985007|277748003
if
the appendix|66754008|181255000
did
not
rupture.|415747007

It
is
important
that patients|116154003
respect
their doctor's advice|309343006|420227002
and
limit|255469002
their physical activity|48761009
so
the tissues|85756007
can
heal|298005009
faster.|16985007|277748003

Recovery
after an appendectomy|80146002
may
not
require
diet changes|41829006|243326001|41829006|263703002
or
a lifestyle change.|60134006|243326001|60134006|263703002

After surgery|83578000
occurs|272120004
,
the patient|116154003
will
be
transferred|129347002
to an postanesthesia care unit|386390005|258666001
so
his
or
her vital signs|61746007|46680005
can
be
closely
monitored|302805002|13288007
to
detect|260373001
anesthesia-|399097000|394577000|33653009
and/or
surgery-related complications.|83578000|272151006|116223007|83578000|262094002|116223007

Pain medication|22253000|410942007
may
also
be
administered|418283001
if necessary.

After patients|116154003
are
completely awake,|248218005
they
are
moved|384598002|370125004
into a hospital room to|285201006
recover.|74822006

Most individuals|125676002|385435006
will
be
offered|410527000
clear|263707001
liquids|33463005
the day|258703001|259032004
after the surgery,|83578000
then
progress|385651009
to a regular diet|41829006|36823005
when
the intestines|261093006
start|255395001
to
function|246464006
properly.

Patients|116154003
are
recommended
to sit up|282921005
on the edge|57183005
of the bed|229772003
and
walk|129006008
short distances|359530003|246132006|367450005|246132006
for several|261028005
times a day.|258703001|259032004

Moving
is
mandatory
and
pain medication|22253000|410942007
may
be
given|419582001
if necessary.

Full recovery|261015003
from appendectomies|80146002
takes|419652001
about four|421534005
to six weeks,|422218008|258705008
but
can
be
prolonged|255224006
to
up to eight weeks|421825006|258705008
if
the appendix|66754008|181255000
had
ruptured.|415747007|263862003

Most appendicitis patients|74400008|116154003|85189001|116154003
recover|74822006
easily|36203004
with surgical treatment,|83578000
but
complications|116223007
can
occur|272120004
if treatment|276239002|416118004
is
delayed
or
if peritonitis|48661000
occurs.|272120004

Recovery time|410669006
depends
on age,|424144002
condition,|260905004
complications,|116223007
and
other circumstances,|74964007
including|55919000
the amount|107651007
of alcohol consumption,|160573003
but
usually
is
between 10
and
28 days.|258703001

For young children|84422007|410601007|84422007|160499008
(
around 10 years old|258707000|70753007
)
,
the recovery
takes|419652001
three weeks.|421291004|258705008

The real possibility
of life-threatening peritonitis|224130005|48661000
is
the reason|410666004
why
acute appendicitis warrants speedy evaluation|85189001|85189001|386053000
and
treatment.|276239002|416118004

The patient|116154003
may
have
to
undergo
a medical evacuation.|74188005|122461007

Appendectomies|80146002
have
occasionally
been
performed|398166005
in emergency conditions|25876001|260905004
(i.e.,|42146005|22971001
outside of a proper hospital|285201006
)
,
when
a timely medical evaluation|74188005|74188005|386053000
was
impossible.

Typical acute appendicitis|85189001
responds
quickly
to appendectomy|80146002
and
occasionally
will
resolve
spontaneously.

If appendicitis|74400008|85189001
resolves
spontaneously,
it
remains
controversial
whether
an elective interval appendectomy|103390000|174045003
should
be
performed|398166005
to
prevent
a recurrent episode|263853000
of appendicitis.|74400008|85189001

Atypical appendicitis|5596004
(
associated|47429007
with suppurative appendicitis|42640003
)
is
more difficult to|242762006|52925006
diagnose|439401001
and
is
more
apt
to
be
complicated|255302009
even
when
operated
early.|264499004

In
either
condition,|260905004
prompt diagnosis|439401001
and
appendectomy|80146002
yield
the best results|394617004
with full recovery|261015003
in two|420797005
to four weeks usually.|421534005|258705008

Mortality|409651001
and
severe complications|24484000|116223007
are
unusual
but
do
occur|272120004
,
especially
if
peritonitis|48661000
persists
and
is
untreated.|25265005

Another entity
known|36692007
as appendicular lump|66754008|300848003|181255000|300848003
is
talked about quite often.|70232002|87335007|70232002|286376008|70232002

It
happens
when
appendix|66754008|181255000
is
not
removed|127485006
early|264499004
during infection
and
omentum|261142000
and
intestine|261093006
get
adherent
to it
forming|35810008
a palpable lump.|103357000|300848003

During this period,|259037005
operation|83578000
is
risky|30207005
unless
there
is
pus formation|11311000|11798007|11311000|255277001|119323008|11798007|119323008|255277001
evident|18669006
by fever|386661006
and
toxicity
or
by USG.

Medical management|74188005|413454004|74188005|119270007
treats|395077000
the condition.|260905004

An unusual complication|116223007|263718001
of an appendectomy|80146002
is
"stump appendicitis"|38033009|74400008|38033009|85189001
:
inflammation|257552002
occurs|272120004
in the remnant appendiceal stump|441850003
left|7771000
after a prior incomplete appendectomy.[41]|236874000|255599008|80146002|236874000|255609007|80146002

Appendicitis|74400008|85189001
is
most common|4757001|72906007
between the ages|424144002
of 5
and
40.[43]|259031006

While
appendectomy|80146002
is
a standard surgical procedure,|83578000
its cost
has
been
found|404684003
to
vary
considerably,
particularly
in the United States.|223688001

A 2012 study|110465008|224699009
from the University of California,|224871002|224043007|224871002|25997004
