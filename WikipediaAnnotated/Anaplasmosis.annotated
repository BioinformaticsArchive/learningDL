*Anaplasmosis|13906002
*
*
is
a disease|64572001
caused|23981006|134198009
by a rickettsial parasite|62065006|37763007|115178001|37763007
of ruminants,
_Anaplasma_ spp.|3351007

The organism|410653004
occurs|272120004
in the red blood cells|14089001|41898006|258759006|126242007
and
is
transmitted|60117003|258150004
by natural means|510009|255586005
through a number|410680006|410681005
of haematophagous species|69658003
of ticks.|106831000

It
can
also
be
transmitted|60117003|258150004
iatrogenically
by the use|277889008|419385000
of surgical, dehorning,|83578000|112843009
castration,|236334001
and
tattoo instruments|57134006
and
hypodermic needles|88959008
that
are
not
disinfected
between uses.|277889008|419385000

Although
the term
is
often|70232002
associated|47429007
with animal infection,|387961004
it
is
also
used|394850002
to
describe
infection
in humans.[1]|278412004

The organism|410653004
can
go
through a complete lifecycle|255594003
in the gut|122865005
of certain species|17162000|69658003
of ticks|106831000
but
the flies|367378007
appear
to
be
only
a mechanical vector,|261018001|260529001
thus,
not
as important
in maintaining|385630006
the disease|64572001
in any given area.|42798000

The disease|64572001
causes|134198009
severe anemia|24484000|271737000
and
wasting
in infected adult cattle.|133936004

Young cattle|84422007
and
most other ruminants|74964007
will
not
show
clinical signs|58147004|72670004
if
infected
but
may
serve
as carriers.|47461006

Since
the organism "|410653004
hides|6080000|421332005
"
from the body's immune system|278195005|255386009|91689009|255386009|279495008|116003000|123037004|116003000
in red blood cells,|14089001|41898006|258759006|126242007
it
is
difficult|52925006
if
not impossible
for an infection to
be
totally
cleared.|84989007

As the immune response wanes,|35024006
the organism again|410653004
builds
up
and
the host relapses.|263855007

In the United States,|223688001
anaplasmosis|13906002
is
notably
present|52101004|246105001
in the south
and
west
where the tick
hosts
_Dermacentor_ spp.|70372009

are
found.|404684003

Although
vaccines|398827000
have
been
developed
,
none|260413007
are
currently available|15240007|103328004
in the United States.|223688001

Early|264499004
in the 20th century,
this disease|64572001
was
considered
one|421379005
of major economic consequence|255603008|103332005
in the western United States.|223688001

In the 1980s
and
1990s,
control|31509003
of ticks|106831000
through new acaricides|7147002|24686008
and
practical treatment|276239002|416118004
with prolonged-action antibiotics,|255224006|129264002|255631004
notably tetracycline,|372809001|16355005|282831004
has
led|88488004|236874000
to the point
where the disease|64572001
is
no longer|255511005
considered
a major problem.|255603008|55607006

Cases|398241000|413769002
of coinfection
with tick-borne microorganisms|106970005|264395009|81827009|264395009|398209006|264395009
are
being
increasingly
reported|229059009|223458004
in the last decade,
[2][3][4] perhaps
explaining
the variable manifestations|255372005|250255003|255372005|251190009
and
clinical responses|58147004
noted
in some patients|116154003
with tick-transmitted diseases.|60117003|64572001|258150004|64572001

In such clinical settings,|58147004
laboratory testing|269814003
for coinfection
is
indicated to|410535002
ensure
that appropriate antimicrobial treatment|250428009|276239002|250428009|416118004
is
given.|419582001

In 2005,
_Anaplasma ovis_|46208006
was
found|404684003
in reindeer populations|71087001|385436007
in Mongolia.|223575007

This pathogen|264418008
and
its associated syndrome|47429007
(
characterized
by lethargy,|214264003
fever|386661006
and
pale mucous membranes|398979000|313268005|301888000|313268005|274643008|313268005|371262000|313268005
)
was
previously only
observed
in wild sheep|255392003
and
goats|125097000|388249000
in the region,|410673009
and
is
the first observed event|255216001|272379006|232714002|272379006
of _A.

ovis_|388254009
in reindeer.|71087001

In Australia,|223621005
bovine anaplasmosis,|13906002
caused|23981006|134198009
by _Anaplasma marginale_,|19038003
is
only
found|404684003
in the northern
and
eastern parts|260726005
of Australia|223621005
where the cattle tick|88012004|74706003
is
present.|52101004|246105001

It
was
probably
introduced|127487003
as early|264499004
as 1829
by cattle
from Indonesia|223589002
infested
with the cattle tick _Boophilus microplus_.[6]|88012004|74706003|74706003|74706003

Anaemia|271737000
may
be
severe|24484000
and
result|394617004
in cardiovascular changes|113257007|243326001|113257007|263703002
such as an increase|260366006
in heart rate.|364075005

Haematuria|53298000
may
occur|272120004
due to the lysis|371757000|239551005
of red blood cells.|14089001|41898006|258759006|126242007

General systemic signs|60132005|31099001|72670004
such as diarrheoa,
anorexia
and
weight loss|89362005
may
also
be
present.|52101004|246105001

A blood smear|87612001|119273009
stained|397165007|127790008
with Giemsa|373646006
should
be
observed
for identification|286672002|7882003
of infected red blood cells|14089001|41898006|258759006|126242007
and
will
allow
definitive diagnosis.[7]|261002007|439401001|261002007

Treatment usually|276239002|416118004
involves|248448006
a prescription|260885003
of doxycycline|372478003
or
a similar class|258391009
of antibiotics.|255631004

Oxytetracycline|372675006
and
imidocarb|373558002
have
also
been
shown
to
be
effective.|255403003|254648000

Supportive therapy|243114000
such as blood products|410652009
and
fluids|32457005|33463005
may
be
necessary.[7]

Vaccines|398827000
against anaplasmosis|13906002
are
available.|103328004

Carrier animals|47461006|387961004|29679002|387961004
should
be
eliminated
from flocks.|419668007

Tick control|31509003
may
also
be
useful
although
it
can
be
difficult to|52925006
implement.[7]

On July 30,
2009,
David Letterman
announced
that
he
had
been
infected
with anaplasmosis.|13906002

He
believes
he
was
most likely|4757001|2931005
bitten|3404009|25272006
by an infected tick
while
camping|10496000
with his 5-year-old son|264706000|258707000|70753007|65616008|264706000|259039008|70753007|65616008|264605009|258707000|70753007|65616008|264605009|259039008|70753007|65616008
