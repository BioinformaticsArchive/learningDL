*Fungemia|434532004
*
*
is
the presence|386397008
of fungi|414561005
or
yeasts|412534006
in the blood.|87612001|119273009

It
is
most commonly|4757001
caused|23981006|134198009
by _Candida_ species|372381007
(also
known|36692007
as
*
*Candidemia|432261003
*
*,
*
*Candedemia
*
*,
and
*
*Invasive Candidiasis|10179008|78048006

,
but
can
be
caused|23981006|134198009
by other fungi|74964007|414561005
as well,|20572008
including|55919000
_Saccharomyces_,|27069008
_Aspergillus_|2429008
and
_Cryptococcus_.|89912005

It
is
most commonly|4757001
seen
in immunosuppressed
or
immunocompromised patients|370391006
with severe neutropenia,|24484000|165517008
oncology patients,|3428006|116154003
or
in patients|116154003
with intravenous catheters.|303728004

Recently,|6493001
it
has
been
suggested
the otherwise immunocompetent patients|35194002|116154003
taking|419652001
infliximab|386891004
may
be
at a higher risk|15508007
for fungemia.|434532004

The diagnosis|439401001
is
complicated,|255302009
as
routine blood cultures|50811001|30088009
have
poor sensitivity.|11403006|35209006|11403006|365705006|255351007|35209006|255351007|365705006

Treatment|276239002|416118004
involves|248448006
use|277889008|419385000
of antifungals,|373219008
e.g.|258795003

fluconazole|387174006
or
amphotericin.|372643008

The three most important risk factors|421291004|80943009

The most commonly known pathogen|4757001|36692007|264418008
is
_Candida albicans_,|20849004|411818003
causing|23981006
roughly 70%
of fungemias,|434532004
followed|367409002
by _Candida glabrata_|444877006
with 10%,
_Aspergillus_|2429008
with 1%|260305007
and
_Saccharomyces_|27069008
as the fourth most common._[citation|29970001|72906007
needed|410525008|103325001
_] However,
the frequency|260864003|272123002
of infection
by _C.

glabrata_,
_Saccharomyces boulardii_,|27069008
_Candida tropicalis_,|47885008

)
_
and
_[C.

parapsilosis]
(/wiki/Candida_parapsilosis|61302002
)
_
is
increasing,|260369004
perhaps because significant use|386134007|277889008|386134007|419385000
of fluconazole|387174006
is
common|72906007
or
due to increase|260366006
in antibiotic use.|255631004|277889008|255631004|419385000

Symptoms
can
range
from mild|255604002
to extreme, often|12565001|70232002
described
as extreme flu-like symptoms.|12565001|315642008

Pain,|22253000
mental disorders,|74732009
chronic fatigue,|90734009|84229001
infections,
are
a few|57176003
of the long list|255511005
of associated symptoms|102483000
with Fungemia.|434532004

Skin infections|108365000
can
include|55919000
persistent
or
unhealing wounds|13924000
and
lesions,
sweating|161857006
,
itching|424492005
,
unusual discharge|307488001|58000006
or
drainage|307488001|122462000
