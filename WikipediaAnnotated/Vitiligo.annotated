is
a condition|260905004
that
causes|134198009
depigmentation|23006000
of sections|62083003|118630004
of skin.|119325001|39937001|181469002

It
occurs|272120004
when
melanocytes,|9683001
the cells|4421005
responsible|394851003
for skin pigmentation,|38962007|370172004
die|419620001|399069006|419099009
or
are
unable to|371151008
function.|246464006

The cause|134198009
of vitiligo|56727007
is
unknown|261665006
,
but
research
suggests
that
it
may
arise|68727004
from autoimmune, genetic, oxidative stress,|263680009|3950001|262188008|263680009|255395001|262188008
neural,|3057000|256864008
or
viral causes.|134198009

The incidence worldwide
is
less
than 1%.|260305007

The most common form|4757001|72906007|246176004
is
non-segmental vitiligo,|403268000
which
tends
to
appear
in symmetric patches,|18772005|36875001
sometimes
over large areas|255509001|42798000
of the body.|279495008|123037004

The most notable symptom|4757001
of vitiligo|56727007
is
depigmentation|23006000
of patches|36875001
of skin|119325001|39937001|181469002
that
occurs|272120004
on the extremities.|66019005|2592007

Although
patches|36875001
are
initially small,|884001|255507004
they often enlarge|70232002|260376009|70232002|118452000
and
change shape.|243326001|107644003|243326001|246176004|243326001|300842002|263703002|107644003|263703002|246176004|263703002|300842002

When
skin lesions|95324001
occur|272120004
,
they
are
most prominent|4757001|4657009
on the face,|89545001|302549007
hands|85562004
and
wrists.|8205005

Depigmentation|23006000
is
particularly noticeable
around body orifices,|279495008|264114003|123037004|264114003
such as the mouth,|74262004|123851003|21082005|181220002
eyes,|81745001
nostrils,|1797002
genitalia
and
umbilicus.|78220002|265800007

Some
lesions
have
hyperpigmentation|49765009
around the edges.|57183005

Patients|116154003
who
are
stigmatised
for their condition|260905004
may
experience
depression|35489007|366979004|255339005
and
similar mood disorders.[6]|46206005

There
are
a number|410680006|410681005
of treatments|276239002
for vitiligo.|56727007

Treatment options generally|276239002|416118004
fall|1912002
into four groups|421534005|261586004|421534005|160481000
:
[7]

Exposing|24932003
the skin|119325001|39937001|181469002
to UVB light|56242006|371268001
from UVB lamps|34160005
is
the most common treatment|4757001|72906007|276239002|4757001|72906007|416118004
for vitiligo.|56727007

The treatments|276239002
can
be
done
at home|261770009
with a domestic UVB lamp|261770009|34160005
or
in a clinic.|35971002|257585005

It
is
important to
control|31509003
the exposure time,|71677004|410669006|24932003|410669006
so
that
the skin|119325001|39937001|181469002
will
not burn|125666000
from over exposure.|21481007|71677004|21481007|24932003

The UVB lamp|34160005
should
have
a timer|22251003
that turns|282987006
off the lamp.|34160005

Normally
a small lamp|255507004|34160005
is
needed|410525008|103325001
if
the spot|23840004
is
small.|255507004

Treatment|276239002|416118004
can
take|419652001
a few weeks|57176003|258705008
if
the spots|271807003|285305004
are
on the neck|45048000|302550007
and
face|89545001|302549007
and
if
they
existed
not more
than 3 years.|260313008|258707000

If
the spots|271807003|285305004
are
on the hands|85562004
and
legs|30021000
and
have
been
there more
than 3 years,|260313008|258707000
it
can
take|419652001
a few months.|57176003|258706009

In a clinic|35971002|257585005
the treatments|276239002
are
done
2?3|260306008
times a week,|258705008|259038000
and
at home|261770009
every day,|69620002
which
makes
the home treatments|261770009|276239002
more effective|242762006|255403003|242762006|254648000
.

If
the spots|271807003|285305004
are
on a large area|255509001|42798000
of the body,|279495008|123037004
full body treatment|261015003|279495008|276239002|261015003|279495008|416118004|261015003|123037004|276239002|261015003|123037004|416118004
in a clinic|35971002|257585005
or
hospital|285201006
will
be
needed.|410525008|103325001

Both
UVB broadband
and
UVB narrowband lamps|34160005
can
be
used.|394850002

However
these treatments|276239002
are
unreliable
at best._[citation
needed|410525008|103325001
_] There
is
no treatment|276239002|416118004
that totally
repigments
the skin.|119325001|39937001|181469002

Adding
a psoralen,|419047007
a photosensitizer,|373212004
or
an immunomodulant[10]
that
increases|260366006
the effect|253861007
of the UV light,|41355003
can
aid|246088000
in partial repigmentation.|255609007

Studies|110465008|224699009
have
shown
that immunomodulator creams|427067006|255621006|372558009|255621006
such as Protopic
and
Elidel also
cause|23981006|134198009
repigmentation
in some cases,|398241000|413769002
when
used|394850002
with UVB narrowband treatments.|276239002

A 1997 report|229059009|223458004
suggests
that combining vitamin B12|89780004|419382002|20909006|419382002
and
folic acid|63718003|104660009
supplements|373453009
with sun exposure|49926000|71677004|49926000|24932003
caused|23981006|134198009
repigmentation
in 52%
of cases.[13]|398241000|413769002

Ultraviolet light|41355003
(UVA treatments|276239002
are
normally
carried|288345009
out
in a hospital clinic.|310390009

Psoralen|419047007
and
ultraviolet A light|41355003
(PUVA treatment|276239002|416118004
involves|248448006
taking
a drug|410942007
which
increases|260366006
the skin's sensitivity|7952008
to ultraviolet light.|41355003

The skin|119325001|39937001|181469002
is
then
exposed|24932003
to high doses|261829003
of ultraviolet A light.|41355003

Treatment|276239002|416118004
is
required
twice a week|258705008|259038000
for 6?12 months|260274009|258706009
or
longer.|255511005

Because of the high doses|261829003
of UVA
and
psoralen,|419047007
PUVA
may
cause|23981006|134198009
side effects
such as sunburn-type reactions|23346002|261664005|263851003
or
skin freckling.[7]|119325001|72298008|39937001|72298008|181469002|72298008

Narrowband ultraviolet B (UVB) phototherapy|415770004|31394004
is
now
used|394850002
more commonly|242762006
than PUVA
as
it
is
less
damaging|37782003
to the skin.|119325001|39937001|181469002

As
with PUVA,
treatment|276239002|416118004
is
carried out twice weekly|288345009|229800002
in a clinic|35971002|257585005
or
every day|69620002
at home,|261770009
and
there
is
no need to|410525008|103325001
use|277889008|419385000
psoralen.[7]|419047007

In October 1992,
a scientific report|229059009|223458004
was
published
of successfully transplanting melanocytes|263903005|9683001|24486003|9683001
to vitiligo affected areas,|56727007|247591002|42798000|56727007|248448006|42798000
effectively
repigmenting
the region.|410673009

The procedure|71388002
involved|248448006
taking|419652001
a thin layer|18043004
of pigmented skin|370172004|46690002
from the patient's gluteal region.|116154003

Melanocytes|9683001
were
then
separated out|13184001|263869007
to a cellular suspension|4421005|7946007|4421005|37595005|4421005|385655000
that
was
expanded|70955005
in culture.|252398009|61594008

The area to|42798000
be
treated|28995006
was
then
denuded
with a dermabrader
and
the melanocytes|9683001
graft|260667007|24486003|119561005
applied.|410618006

Between 70
and
85 percent|118582008
of patients|116154003
experienced
nearly
complete|255594003
repigmentation
of their skin.|119325001|39937001|181469002

The longevity|111951006
of the repigmentation
differed
from person|125676002
to person.[15]|125676002

In mild cases,|255604002|398241000|255604002|413769002
vitiligo patches|56727007|36875001
can
be
hidden|6080000
with makeup
or
other cosmetic camouflage solutions.|74964007|81024003|8537005|74964007|261513001|8537005

If
the affected person|247591002|125676002|248448006|125676002
is
pale-skinned,|398979000
the patches|36875001
can
be
made
less visible|276139006|24054004|263796003|24054004
by avoiding
both
sunlight|49926000
and
the tanning|60386007
of unaffected skin.[16]|119325001|39937001|181469002

The traditional treatment|263901007|276239002|263901007|416118004
is
the application|410618006
of corticosteroid cream.[17]

In cases|398241000|413769002
of extensive|41118005
vitiligo|56727007
the option
to
de-pigment|65863008
the unaffected skin|119325001|39937001|181469002
with topical drugs|410942007|359540000|410942007
like monobenzone,|414760009
mequinol|422343004
or
hydroquinone|387422001
may
be
considered
to
render
the skin|119325001|39937001|181469002
an even colour.|263714004

The removal|118292001|128303001
of all
the skin pigment|36938005|370172004|46690002
with monobenzone|414760009
is
permanent|6934004
and
vigorous.

Sun-safety|49926000
must
be
adhered|102491009
to
for life to|224130005
avoid
severe sun burn|24484000|23346002
and
melanomas.|372244006

Depigmentation|23006000
takes|419652001
about a year to|258707000|259039008
complete.[7]|255594003

In non-segmental vitiligo (NSV),|403268000
there
is
usually
some
form|246176004
of symmetry|18772005
in the location|246267002
of the patches|36875001
of depigmentation.|23006000

New patches also|7147002|36875001
appear
over time|410669006
and
can
be
generalized|60132005
over large portions|255509001|260726005
of the body|279495008|123037004
or
localized|255471002
to a particular area.|42798000

Vitiligo|56727007
where little pigmented skin remains|370172004|46690002
is
referred|439980006
to
as
_vitiligo universalis_.|56727007

NSV
can
come
about
at any age,|424144002
unlike segmental vitiligo,|403268000
which
is
far more prevalent|46053002
in teenage years.[5]|22396007|258707000

Classes|258391009
of non-segmental vitiligo|403268000
include|55919000
:

Segmental vitiligo (SV)|403268000
differs
in appearance,|386548000|255412001
etiology|134198009
and
prevalence
from associated illnesses.|47429007|39104002

Its treatment|276239002|416118004
is
different|263735002
from that
of NSV.

It
tends
to
affect|4065008
areas|42798000
of skin|119325001|39937001|181469002
that
are
associated|47429007
with dorsal roots|25938006
from the spine|421060004|44300000|243930007
and
is
most often unilateral.|4757001|70232002|66459002

It
spreads|410677005
much more rapidly|242762006|418694008|4757001|418694008
than NSV
and
,
without treatment,|276239002|416118004
it
is
much more stable/ static in course|242762006|58158008|257390007|288524001|4757001|58158008|257390007|288524001
and
is
not
associated|47429007
with auto-immune diseases.|41266007

It
is
a very treatable condition|260358002|260905004
that
responds
to topical treatment.[5]|276239002|416118004|359540000|276239002|359540000|416118004

Vitiligo|56727007
on lighter skin|75926004|119325001|75926004|39937001|75926004|181469002

Vitiligo|56727007
on darker skin|255419005|119325001|255419005|39937001|255419005|181469002

Conditions|260905004
with similar symptoms
include|55919000
:

Vitiligo|56727007
is
a disorder|64572001
characterized
by patchy loss|10027005
of skin pigmentation|38962007|370172004
due to immune attacks|255386009|216299002
on melanocytes.|9683001

Although
there
is
no significant proof|386134007|229796008
or
evidence,|18669006
many doctors|309343006
believe
that
it
can
be
caused|23981006|134198009
by defects|6920004
in many genes_[citation|67271001
needed|410525008|103325001
_].

Variations|40885006
in genes|67271001
that
are
part|260726005
of the immune system|116003000
or
part|260726005
of melanocytes|9683001
have
both
been
associated|47429007
with vitiligo.|56727007

The immune system genes|116003000|67271001
are
associated|47429007
with other autoimmune disorders.|74964007|85828009

In one case,|421379005|398241000
the gene TYR,|67271001|45394009|67271001|418246001
which
makes
the melanocyte|9683001
more susceptible|242762006|131196009
to the immune system|116003000
in vitiligo,|56727007
also
makes
the melanocyte|9683001
more susceptible|242762006|131196009
to the immune system|116003000
in the skin cancer malignant melanoma.|93655004|21594007|93655004|363346000|93655004|372087000

So
people|125676002
with vitiligo|56727007
caused|23981006|134198009

A genomewide association study|263534001|110465008|263534001|224699009|272151006|110465008|272151006|224699009
found|404684003
10 independent susceptibility loci|371153006|76522002|371153006|118588007
for generalized vitiligo,|403269008
responsible|394851003
for 7.4%
of the genetic risk.|3950001|30207005|255395001|30207005

Some patients|116154003
had
vitiligo alone|56727007|105529008
;
others|74964007
had
generalized vitiligo|403269008
with other autoimmune diseases.|74964007|85828009

Most loci
were
associated|47429007
with
both
forms.|246176004

(
The exception
was
PTPN22,
which
was
only
associated|47429007
with generalized vitiligo.|403269008

In the MHC region,|410673009
which
controls|54776003|31509003
the immune system,|116003000
major association signals|255603008|263534001|255603008|272151006
were
identified|7882003
in the class I gene region|258392002|67271001|410673009
(
between HLA-|47038001
A
and
HLA-HGC9|47038001

and
class II gene region|258393007|67271001|410673009
(
between HLA-DRB1|47038001
and
HLA-DQA1|47038001
).

Outside the MHC region,|410673009
association signals|263534001|272151006
were
identified|7882003
near RERE,
PTPN22,
LPP,
IL2RA,
GZMB,
UBASH3A
and
C1QTNF6 genes,|67271001
which
are
associated|47429007
with other autoimmune diseases.|74964007|85828009

TYR|45394009|418246001
encodes
tyrosinase,|23696008|45394009
which
is
not
a component|246093002
of the immune system,|116003000
but
is
an enzyme|90668006
of the melanocyte|9683001
that
catalyzes
melanin biosynthesis,|59094002|11798007
and
a major autoantigen|255603008|65150000
in generalized vitiligo.|403269008

The major alleles|255603008|9109004
of TYR|45394009|418246001
are
associated|47429007
with vitiligo,|56727007
and
the minor alleles|410599005|9109004|255606000|9109004
are
associated|47429007
with malignant melanoma.|372244006|93655004

The transcriptional profile|10589004
of melanocytes|9683001
from vitiligo patients|56727007|116154003
have
been
studied.|110465008|224699009

Oligonucleotide microarrays|23243007
containing|42504009
approximately 16,000 unique genes|26175008|67271001
were
used|394850002
to
analyse
mRNA expression|69908008|10012005
in melanocytes|9683001
from vitiligo patients|56727007|116154003
and
age-matched healthy controls.|424144002|33336008|263775005|31509003

In total,|258755000|255619001
859 genes|67271001
were
identified|7882003
as differentially
expressed.[19]

Vitiligo|56727007
is
sometimes
associated|47429007
with autoimmune|263680009
and
inflammatory diseases,|128139000
[20] commonly thyroid overexpression|69748006|61020000
and
underexpression.

A study|110465008|224699009
comparing
656 people|125676002
with
and
without vitiligo|56727007
in 114 families|35359004
found|404684003
several mutations|261028005|55446002
(single-nucleotide polymorphisms|125681006|71211001|50334000|50607009|71211001|50334000
in the NALP1 gene.|67271001

The NALP1 gene,|67271001
which
is
on chromosome 17|45201007
located
at 17p13,
is
on a cascade
that
regulates
inflammation|257552002
and
cell death,|4421005|419620001|4421005|268923008|362837007|419620001|362837007|268923008
including|55919000
myeloid|255391005
and
lymphoid cells,|56972008
which
are
white cells|52501007
that
are
part|260726005
of the immune response.|35024006

NALP1
is
expressed
at high levels|75540009|258395000|371879000|258395000
in T cells|57184004
and
Langerhan cells,|76322003
white blood cells|767002|52501007
that
are
involved|248448006
in skin autoimmunity.|119325001|4301008|39937001|4301008|181469002|4301008

Polymorphisms|50334000
of CD4
were
shown
to
be
associated|47429007
with the vitiligo|56727007
and
other autoimmune diseases|74964007|85828009
like type I Diabetes Mellitus.[21]|46635009

Among the inflammatory products
of NALP1
are
caspase 1|130666007
and
caspase 7,
which
activate
the inflammatory cytokine interleukin-1?.|75777003|116722001|75777003|50762005

Interleukin-1?|116722001|50762005
is
expressed
at high levels|75540009|258395000|371879000|258395000
in patients|116154003
with vitiligo.|56727007

There
are
compounds|62105006
which
inhibit|61511001
caspase
and
interleukin-1?,|116722001|50762005
and
so|223528007
might
be
useful drugs|410942007
for vitiligo|56727007
and
associated autoimmune diseases.|47429007|85828009

In one|421379005
of the mutations,|55446002
the amino acid leucine|52518006|412424004
in the NALP1 protein|88878007
was
replaced|282089006|370124000
by histidine|60260004
(Leu155-
>
His
).

The original protein|19535007|88878007
and
sequence|72633008
is
highly|75540009
conserved
in evolution,
and
found|404684003
in humans,|278412004
chimpanzee,|1480007|389223000
rhesus monkey,|72941006
and
bush baby,|389053001
which means|255586005
that
it
is
an important protein|88878007
and
an alteration
is
likely to|2931005
be
harmful.
