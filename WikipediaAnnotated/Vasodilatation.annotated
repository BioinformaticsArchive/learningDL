When
blood vessels|59820001
dilate|255381004
,
the flow
of blood|87612001|119273009
is
increased|35105006|260366006
due to a decrease|260400001|260370003
in vascular resistance.|88619007

Therefore,
dilation|25322007|71025006|363105001
of arterial blood vessels|4635002|59820001|51114001|59820001|263954005|59820001
(mainly
the arterioles|28225005
)
causes|134198009
a decrease|260400001|260370003
in blood pressure.|75367002|392570002|386536003

The response
may
be
intrinsic|260521003|255406006
(
due to local processes|255470001|415178003
in the surrounding tissue|355648006|85756007
)
or
extrinsic|261074009|255400000
(
due to hormones|87568004
or
the nervous system.|25087005|278196006

Additionally,
the response
may
be
localized|255471002
to a specific organ|69658003|410653004
(
depending
on the metabolic needs|410525008|103325001
of a particular tissue,|85756007
as
during strenuous exercise|61686008
)
,
or
it
may
be
systemic|31099001
(
seen
throughout the entire systemic circulation.|255503000|31099001|413854007|260232004|31099001|413854007

Drugs|410942007
that
cause|23981006|134198009
vasodilation|91081006
are
termed
*
*vasodilators|372787008
*
*.

The primary function|63161005|246464006|261424001|246464006
of vasodilation|91081006
is
to
increase|260366006
blood flow|58190003
in the body|279495008|123037004
to tissues|85756007
that
need|410525008|103325001
it most.

This
is
often|70232002
in response
to a localized need|255471002|410525008|255471002|103325001
of oxygen,|24099007
but
can
occur|272120004
when
the tissue|85756007
in question|42425007
is
not
receiving
enough glucose|67079006|72191006
or
lipids|70106000
or
other nutrients.|74964007|226355009

Localized tissues|255471002|85756007
utilize
multiple ways to|260396001
increase|260366006
blood flow|58190003
including|55919000
releasing vasodilators,|129299003|372787008
primarily adenosine,|35431001
into the local instersitial fluid|255470001|32457005|255470001|33463005|255470001|255765007|255470001
which
diffuses|19648000
to capillary beds|20982000|229772003|255416003|229772003
provoking|410658008
local vasodilation.|255470001|91081006

Some physiologists|78841004
have
suggested
it
is
the lack|41277001
of oxygen|24099007
itself which
causes|134198009
capillary beds to|20982000|229772003|255416003|229772003
vasodilate
by the smooth muscle hypoxia|122447002|389086002
of the vessels|59820001
in the region.|410673009

This latter hypothesis
is
posited
due to the presence|386397008
of precapillary sphincters in capillary beds.|20982000|229772003|255416003|229772003

Neither
of these approaches|103379005
to the mechanism|257544000
of vasodilation|91081006
is
mutually exclusive
of the other.[2]|74964007

Vasodilation directly|91081006
affects|4065008
the relationship|272151006
between mean arterial pressure,|6797001
cardiac output|82799009
and
total peripheral resistance (TPR).|386530009

Vasodilation|91081006
occurs|272120004
in the time phase|410669006|21191007
of cardiac systole|80891009|111973004
while
vasoconstriction|32318003
follows|367409002
in the opposite time phase|410669006|21191007
of cardiac diastole.|80891009|90892000

Mathematically,
cardiac output|82799009
(blood flow|58190003
measured|258104002
in volume|118565006|419569009
per unit time|258666001|410669006
)
is
computed
by multiplying|421206002
the heart rate|364075005
(
in beats
per minute|258701004|255507004|286549009|356624006
)
and
the stroke volume|90096001
(
the volume|118565006|419569009
of blood|87612001|119273009
ejected
during ventricular systole|8997002
).

TPR
depends
on several factors,|261028005
including|55919000
the length|410668003
of the vessel,|59820001
the viscosity|78949001
of blood|87612001|119273009
(
determined
by hematocrit|28317006|365616005
and
the diameter|81827009
of the blood vessel.|59820001|361097006

The latter
is
the most important variable|4757001|255372005
in determining resistance,|30714006
with the TPR changing|243326001|263703002
by the fourth power|29970001|33300005
of the radius.|62413002|181940002|131190003

An increase|260366006
in either
of these physiological components|1360005|246093002
(cardiac output|82799009
or
TPR
)
cause|23981006|134198009
a rise
in the mean arterial pressure.|6797001

Vasodilation|91081006
works|261041009
to
decrease|260400001|260370003
TPR
and
blood pressure|75367002|392570002|386536003
through relaxation
of smooth muscle cells|122447002|4421005
in the tunica media|61695000
layer
of large arteries|3222005
and
smaller arterioles.[3]|263796003|28225005|255507004|28225005

Vasodilation|91081006
occurs|272120004
in superficial blood vessels|26283006|59820001
of warm-blooded animals
when
their ambient environment|276339004
is
hot|264018002
;
this process|415178003
diverts
the flow
of heated blood|88999006|87612001|88999006|119273009
to the skin|119325001|39937001|181469002
of the animal,|387961004
where heat|88999006
can
be
more easily|242762006|36203004
released|68776005|129299003
into the atmosphere.|304607008

The opposite physiological process|1360005|415178003
is
vasoconstriction.|32318003

These processes|415178003
are
naturally
modulated|261019009
by local paracrine agents|255470001|260872001
from endothelial cells|45709008
(e.g.|258795003

nitric oxide,|409378005
bradykinin,|56448008
potassium ions|88480006|48006008
and
adenosine,|35431001
as well as
an organism's autonomic nervous system|410653004|72167002
and
adrenal glands,|23451007
both
of which
secrete
catecholamines|34582008
such as norepinephrine|45555007
and
epinephrine,|387362001
respectively.

Vasodilation|91081006
is
the result|394617004
of relaxation
in smooth muscle|122447002
surrounding|355648006
the blood vessels.|59820001

This relaxation,
in turn,|282987006
relies
on removing|127485006
the stimulus|8927009
for contraction,|78558002
which
depends
on intracellular calcium ion concentrations|83167003|5540006|48006008|82742001
and
,
consequently,
phosphorylation|363262008
of the light chain|56242006|46666003|371268001|46666003
of the contractile protein myosin.|12140005|88878007|23038005

Thus,
vasodilation mainly|91081006
works|261041009
either
by lowering intracellular calcium concentration|261122009|83167003|5540006|82742001
or
the dephosphorylation
of myosin.|23038005

This
includes|55919000
stimulation|122545008
of myosin light chain phosphatase|130507005
and
induction|16404004
of calcium symporters|5540006
and
antiporters
that pump calcium ions|44668000|5540006|48006008
out of the intracellular compartment.|83167003

This
is
accomplished
through reuptake
of ions|48006008
into the sarcoplasmic reticulum|24961002
via exchangers
and
expulsion|118636005
across the plasma membrane.|53982002

There
are
three main intracellular stimuli|421291004|63161005|83167003|8927009
that
can
result|394617004
in the vasodilation|91081006
of blood vessels.|59820001

The specific mechanisms to|69658003|257544000
accomplish
these effects|253861007
vary
from vasodilator|372787008
to vasodilator.|372787008

PDE5 inhibitors|407313002
and
potassium channel openers|88480006|255592004
can
also
have
similar results.|394617004

Compounds|62105006
that
mediate|73510009
the above mechanisms|261183002|257544000
may
be
grouped|255504006
as endogenous|73979006
and
exogenous.|261074009|51352008

The vasodilating action|129264002
of activation
of beta-2 receptors|52095000|116647005|260989008|116647005
(
such as
by noradrenaline|45555007|35214005
)
appears
to
be
endothelium-independent.[9]|27168002|371153006

Whereas
it
is
recognized
that
that
the sympathetic nervous system|68365008|362484004
plays|300776002
an expendable role
in vasodilation,|91081006
it
is
one|421379005
of the mechanisms|257544000
by which
it
can
be
accomplished.

The spinal cord|2748008|180959008
has
both
vasodilation|91081006
and
vasoconstriction nerves.|32318003|3057000

The neurons|47220008
that
control|31509003
vascular vasodilation|59820001|91081006
originate
in the hypothalmus.

Some sympathetic stimulation|122545008
of arterioles|28225005
in skeletal muscle|127954009|244716004
is
mediated|73510009
by epinephrine|387362001
acting
on ?-adrenergic receptors|59208001
of arteriolar smooth muscle|28225005|122447002|337724002|122447002
which
would
be
mediated|73510009
by cAMP pathways
as mentioned above.

However,
it
has
been
shown
that knocking out|282750008
this sympathetic stimulation|122545008
plays|300776002
little|281411007|255507004
to no role
in
whether skeletal muscle|127954009|244716004
is
able to|371150009
receive
sufficient oxygen even|51117008|24099007
at high levels|75540009|258395000|371879000|258395000
of exertion,|19487008
so
it
is
believed
that
this particular method|260686004|272394005
of vasodilation|91081006
is
of little import
to human physiology.[10]|278412004|1360005

In cases|398241000|413769002
of emotional distress,|224977004
this system|246333005
may
activate
,
resulting|42752001
in fainting|271594007
due to decreased blood pressure|45007003
from vasodilation,|91081006
which
is
referred to|439980006
as
vasovagal syncope.[11]|398665005

Cold-induced vasodilation (CIVD)|285686007|16404004|91081006|82272006|16404004|91081006|84162001|16404004|91081006
occurs|272120004
after cold exposure,|40537000
possibly to|60022001
reduce|260400001
the risk|30207005
of injury.

It
can
take|419652001
place|257557008|421066005
in several locations|261028005|246267002
in the human body,|279495008|281189005
but
is
observed most often|70232002
in the extremities.|66019005|2592007

The fingers|7569003|259052003
are
especially common|72906007
because
they
are
exposed|24932003
most often.|4757001|70232002

When
the fingers|7569003|259052003
are
exposed|24932003
to cold vasoconstriction|285686007|32318003|82272006|32318003|84162001|32318003
occurs|272120004
first to|255216001|232714002
reduce|260400001
heat loss,|88999006
but
also
results|394617004
in strong cooling|260404005
of the fingers.|7569003|259052003

Approximately five to|26175008|421820001
ten|23067006|420258001
minutes|258701004|255507004|356624006
after the start|255395001
of the cold exposure|40537000
of the hand,|85562004|302539009
the blood vessels|59820001
in the finger tips|312543003
will
suddenly
vasodilate.

This
is
probably
caused|23981006|134198009
by a sudden decrease|255363002|260400001|255363002|260370003
in the release|58000006|68776005|258760001|129299003|115956009
of neurotransmitters|35069000
from the sympathetic nerves|90456006|181098007
to the muscular coat|91727004|228224007|263816006|228224007
of the arteriovenous anastomoses|36686001|46196009
due to local cold.|255470001|285686007|255470001|82272006|255470001|84162001

The CIVD
increases|260366006
blood flow|58190003
and
subsequently
the temperature|105723007|246508008
of the fingers.|7569003|259052003

It
is
likely to|2931005
help
improve|385425000|3442003|385633008
manual performance.|87982008

A new phase|7147002|21191007
of vasoconstriction|32318003
follows|367409002
the vasodilation,|91081006
after
which the process|415178003
repeats|27582007
itself.

This
is
called
the hunting reaction.|263851003

Experiments
have
revealed|263857004
that
the hunting reaction|263851003
is
not
the only possible response|50607009|371930009|50607009|60022001|420295001|371930009|420295001|60022001
to immersion|19674006
of the finger|7569003|302541005
in cold water,|285686007|11713004|285686007|119318008|82272006|11713004|82272006|119318008|84162001|11713004|84162001|119318008
but
it
does
constitute
the majority
of the possible reactions.[12]|371930009|263851003|60022001|263851003

Other suggested vasodilators|74964007|372787008
or
vasodilating factors
include|55919000
:

Vasodilators|372787008
are
used|394850002
to
treat|395077000
conditions|260905004
such as hypertension,|38341003
where
the patient|116154003
has
an abnormally high blood pressure,|38341003
as well as
angina,|225566008
congestive heart failure,|42343007
erectile dysfunction|397803000
and
where
maintaining|385630006
a lower blood pressure|45007003
reduces|260400001
the patient's risk|116154003|30207005
of developing other cardiac problems.|80891009|55607006

Flushing|271811009
may
be
a physiological response|1360005
to vasodilators.|372787008

A phosphodiesterase inhibitor,|373692009
works|261041009
to
increase|260366006
blood flow|58190003
in the penis|18911002|265793009
through vasodilation.|91081006

It
may
also
be
used|394850002
to
treat|395077000
pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH).|26174007
