*lymphoedema|234097001
*
*
in British English,|297487008|25804004
also
known|36692007
as
*
*lymphatic obstruction|83555006|26036001
*
*,
is
a condition|260905004
of localized fluid retention|255471002|43498006
and
tissue swelling|85756007|423666004|85756007|442672001
caused|23981006|134198009
by a compromised lymphatic system.|89890002

The lymphatic system|89890002
returns|7528007
the interstitial fluid|32457005|33463005|255765007
to the thoracic duct|1732005
and
then
to the bloodstream,
where it
is
recirculated
back
to the tissues.|85756007

Tissues|85756007
with lymphedema|234097001
are
at risk|410519009
of infection.

Symptoms
may
include|55919000
severe fatigue,|24484000|84229001
a heavy swollen limb|410712002|442672001|66019005|410712002|442672001|243996003
or
localized fluid accumulation|255471002|17672001
in other body areas,|74964007|279495008|42798000|74964007|123037004|42798000
including|55919000
the head|69536005|302548004
or
neck,|45048000|302550007
discoloration|47415006
of the skin|119325001|39937001|181469002
overlying|255547006
the lymphedema,|234097001
and
eventually deformity|276654001|127560004|417893002
(elephantiasis.

Lymphedema|234097001
should
not
be
confused|286933003
with edema arising|423666004|68727004
from venous insufficiency,|20696009
which
is
_
not_ lymphedema.|234097001

However,
untreated venous insufficiency|25265005|20696009
can
progress|385651009
into a combined venous/lymphatic disorder|89780004|29092000|111590001|89780004|263925004|111590001
which
is
treated|28995006
the same way|262126009
as lymphedema.|234097001

Presented|246105001
here
is
an extreme case|12565001|398241000
of severe unilateral hereditary lymphedema|24484000|66459002|254199006
which
had
been
present|52101004|246105001
for 25 years|258707000
without treatment|276239002|416118004

Lymphedema|234097001
affects|4065008
approximately 140 million people worldwide.[1]|26175008|125676002

Lymphedema|234097001
may
be
inherited|255404009
(primary|63161005|261424001
)
or
caused|23981006|134198009
by injury
to the lymphatic vessels|83555006
(secondary|2603003|81170007
).

It
is
most frequently|4757001|70232002
seen
after lymph node dissection,|58347006
surgery|83578000
and/or
radiation therapy,|108290001
in which
damage|37782003
to the lymphatic system|89890002
is
caused|23981006|134198009
during the treatment|276239002|416118004
of cancer,|363346000|372087000
most notably breast cancer.|254837009|254838004

In many patients|116154003
with cancer,|363346000|372087000
this condition|260905004
does
not
develop
until months|258706009
or
even years|258707000
after therapy|276239002
has
concluded.

Lymphedema|234097001
may
also
be
associated|47429007
with accidents
or
certain diseases|17162000|64572001
or
problems|55607006
that
may
inhibit|61511001
the lymphatic system|89890002
from functioning properly.|246464006

In tropical areas|42798000
of the world,
a common cause|72906007|134198009
of secondary lymphedema|28590005
is
filariasis,|105706003
a parasitic infection.|17322007

It
can
also
be
caused|23981006|134198009
by a compromising
of the lymphatic system|89890002
resulting|42752001
from cellulitis.|128045006

While
the exact cause|134198009
of primary lymphedema|254199006|77123007|400158000
is
still unknown,|261665006
it generally
occurs|272120004
due to poorly|556001
developed
or
missing lymph nodes|59441001
and/or
channels|255592004
in the body.|279495008|123037004

Lymphedema|234097001
may
be
present|52101004|246105001
at birth,|3950001
develop
at the onset|77374008
of puberty|18991001
(praecox|235246008
)
,
or
not
become
apparent
for many years|258707000
into adulthood|41847000
(tarda|263895009
).

In men,|339947000
lower-limb primary lymphedema|61685007|254199006|61685007|77123007|61685007|400158000|182281004|254199006|182281004|77123007|182281004|400158000
is
most common,|4757001|72906007
occurring|272120004
in one|421379005
or
both legs.|30021000

Some cases|398241000|413769002
of lymphedema|234097001
may
be
associated|47429007
with other vascular abnormalities.|74964007|59820001|276654001

Secondary lymphedema|28590005
affects|4065008
both
men|339947000
and
women.|224526002

In women,|224526002
it
is
most prevalent|4757001
in the upper limbs|53120007
after breast cancer surgery|408469009|363346000|408469009|372087000|254837009|83578000|254838004|83578000
and
lymph node dissection,|58347006
occurring|272120004
in the arm|40983000|53120007|182245002|302538001
on the side|182353008
of the body|279495008|123037004
in which
the surgery|83578000
is
performed.|398166005

In Western countries,|223369002
secondary lymphedema|28590005
is
most commonly|4757001
due to cancer treatment.|363346000|276239002|363346000|416118004|372087000|276239002|372087000|416118004

Between 38|264670000
and
89%
of breast cancer patients|254837009|116154003|254838004|116154003
suffer
from lymphedema|234097001
due to axillary lymph node dissection|234262008
and/or
radiation.|30821001|82107009|108290001

Unilateral lymphedema|66459002|234097001
occurs|272120004
in
up to 41%
of patients|116154003
after gynecologic cancer.|74570005|363346000|74570005|372087000

For men,|339947000
a 5-66% incidence|264706000|264605009
of lymphedema|234097001
has
been
reported|229059009|223458004
in patients|116154003
treated|28995006
with incidence
depending
on
whether staging|72589006
or
radical removal|32948009|118292001|32948009|128303001|255612005|118292001|255612005|128303001
of lymph glands|59441001
was
done
in addition|260364009
to radiotherapy.[1][5][6]|419815003|108290001

Head|69536005|302548004
and
neck lymphedema|45048000|234097001|302550007|234097001
can
be
caused|23981006|134198009
by surgery|83578000
or
radiation therapy|108290001
for tongue|21974007|181226008
or
throat cancer.|54066008|363346000|54066008|372087000|49928004|363346000|49928004|372087000|264231000|363346000|264231000|372087000

It
may
also
occur|272120004
in the lower limbs|61685007
or
groin|255575008
after surgery|83578000
for colon,|263977005|302508007
ovarian|15497006|83238006|181464007
or
uterine cancer,|371973000
in which removal|118292001|128303001
of lymph nodes|59441001
or
radiation therapy|108290001
is
required.

Surgery|83578000
or
treatment|276239002|416118004
for prostate,|263847000|181422007
colon|263977005|302508007
and
testicular cancers|363449006
may
result|394617004
in secondary lymphedema,|28590005
particularly
when
lymph nodes|59441001
have
been
removed|127485006
or
damaged.|37782003

The onset|77374008
of secondary lymphedema|28590005
in patients|116154003
who
have
had
cancer surgery|363346000|83578000|372087000|83578000
has
also
been
linked
to aircraft flight|21753002
(likely|2931005
due to decreased cabin pressure|29165009
).

For cancer survivors,|363346000|372087000
therefore,
wearing
a prescribed
and
properly fitted compression garment|91175000|71173004|272180002|91175000|263720003|272180002
may
help
decrease swelling|260400001|423666004|260400001|442672001|260370003|423666004|260370003|442672001
during air travel.|417696007|420008001

Some cases|398241000|413769002
of lower-limb lymphedema|61685007|234097001|182281004|234097001
have
been
associated|47429007
with the use|277889008|419385000
of tamoxifen,|373345002
due to the blood clots|75753009
and
deep vein thrombosis (DVT)|128053003|404223003
that
can
be
caused|23981006|134198009
by this medication.|410942007

Resolution
of the blood clots|75753009
or
DVT|128053003
is
needed|410525008|103325001
before lymphedema treatment|234097001|276239002|234097001|416118004
can
be
initiated.

Lymph|38000004
is
formed|35810008
from the fluid|32457005|33463005|255765007
that filters|116250002
out of the blood circulation to|87612001|413854007|119273009|413854007
nourish
cells.|4421005

This fluid returns|32457005|7528007|33463005|7528007|255765007|7528007|7528007
through venous capillaries|29092000|20982000|263925004|20982000
to the blood circulation|87612001|413854007|119273009|413854007
through the force|285653008
of osmosis|47410001
in the venous blood|53130003
;
however,
a portion|260726005
of the fluid|32457005|33463005|255765007
which
contains|42504009
proteins,|88878007
cellular debris,|4421005|257159000
bacteria,|409822003
etc.

must
return|7528007
through the lymphatic collection system to|89890002
maintain|385630006
tissue fluid balance.|85756007|251856003

The collection
of this prelymph fluid|32457005|33463005|255765007
is
carried out|288345009
by the initial lymph collectors|884001|38000004|232714002|38000004
which
are
blind-ended epithelial-lined vessels|385656004|50009006|59820001|422117008|50009006|59820001|385656004|50009006|59820001|422117008|50009006|59820001
with fenestrated openings|56116003
that
allow
fluids|32457005|33463005
and
particles
as large|255509001
as cells to|4421005
enter.|417985001

Once
inside the lumen|113342003|342806003|398252006
of the lymphatic vessels,|83555006
the fluid|32457005|33463005|255765007
is
guided|106384005|303479009
along increasingly larger vessels,|42586008
first|255216001|232714002
with rudimentary valves to
prevent
backflow,
which later
develop
into complete valves|255594003
similar
to the venous valve.|72139006

Once the lymph|38000004
enters|417985001
the fully
valved
lymphatic vessels,|83555006
it
is
pumped|44668000
by a rhythmic peristaltic-|272121000|28423000
like action|129264002
by smooth muscle cells|122447002|4421005
within the lymphatic vessel walls.|83555006|224727009|279089004|224727009

This peristaltic action|28423000|129264002
is
the primary driving force,|63161005|129060000|63161005|129060000|285653008|261424001|129060000|261424001|129060000|285653008
moving
lymph|38000004
within its vessel walls.|59820001|224727009

The regulation
of the frequency|260864003|272123002
and
power|33300005
of contraction|78558002
is
regulated
by the sympathetic nervous system.|68365008|362484004

The movement|255324009
of lymph|38000004
can
also
be
influenced
by the pressure|279046003|13543005|257893003
of nearby muscle contraction,|12140005
arterial pulse pressure,|87179004
and
the vacuum|81547007
created
in the chest cavity|43799004
during respiration,|258162000
but
these passive forces
contribute
only
a minor percentage|410599005|118582008|255606000|118582008
of lymph transport.|38000004|57188001|38000004|360300001

The fluids|32457005|33463005
collected
are
pumped|44668000
into continually larger vessels|42586008
and
through lymph nodes,|59441001
which
clean|228402009
out debris|255529000|257159000
and
police
the fluid|32457005|33463005|255765007
for potential threats|30207005
from dangerous microbes.|264395009

The lymph|38000004
ends|261782000
its journey
in the thoracic duct,|1732005
where
it
re-enters|228877007|417985001
the blood circulation.|87612001|413854007|119273009|413854007

Assessment|386053000
of the lower extremities|61685007
begins|255395001
with a visual inspection|255374006|32750006
of the legs.|30021000

Color,|263714004
presence|386397008
of hair,|386045008|119326000
visible veins,|24054004|29092000
size|277049003
of the legs|30021000
and
any
sores|247348008|279074008|410713007
or
ulcerations|429040005
should
be
noted.

Lack|41277001
of hair|386045008|119326000
may
indicate|410535002
an arterial circulation problem.|51114001|413854007|55607006|263954005|413854007|55607006

If
swelling|423666004|442672001
is
observed,
the calf circumference|53840002|74551000|244015008|74551000
should
be
measured|258104002
with a tape measure.|51791000

This measurement|272391002
can
be
compared
to future measurements to|272391002
see|281004000
if
the swelling|423666004|442672001
is
getting
better.|3442003

Determine
if elevating|75540009
the legs|30021000
makes
the swelling|423666004|442672001
go
away.

Pressure|279046003|13543005|257893003
should
be
applied|410618006
with the fingertips|312543003
over the ankle to|70258002|108371006|361292008
determine
the degree|258395000|246173007
of swelling.|423666004|442672001

The assessment|386053000
should
also
include|55919000
a check|360160009
of the popliteal, femoral, posterior tibial,|255580004|421235005|255551008|12611008
and
dorsalis pedis pulses.|421811005

When
checking|360160009
the femoral pulse,|67316000
feel|285854004
for the inguinal nodes|255575008|255288007|255575008|263820005
and
determine
if
they
are
enlarged.|260376009|118452000

Enlargement|56246009|118452000|442021009
of the nodes|255288007|263820005
lasting
more
than three weeks|421291004|258705008
may
indicate|410535002
infection
or
some other disease process|74964007|64572001|415178003
requiring
further medical attention.[8]|46053002|74188005|6769007

The diagnosis|439401001
or
early detection|264499004
of lymphedema|234097001
is
difficult.|52925006

The first signs|276131009
may
be
subjective observations|255362007
such as "
my arm feels|40983000|285854004|53120007|285854004|182245002|285854004|302538001|285854004
heavy"|410712002
or
"I|42146005|22971001
have
difficulty|371157007
these days|258703001
getting
rings on and off|257380004
my fingers".|7569003|259052003

These
may
be
symptomatic|264931009
of early stage|264499004|21191007|264499004|371508000|264499004|261612004
of lymphedema|234097001
where accumulation
of lymph|38000004
is
mild|255604002
and
not detectable
by any difference|263735002
in arm volume|40983000|118565006|40983000|419569009|53120007|118565006|53120007|419569009|182245002|118565006|182245002|419569009|302538001|118565006|302538001|419569009
or
circumference.|74551000

As lymphedema|234097001
develops
further,|46053002
definitive diagnosis|261002007|439401001|261002007
is
commonly
based|418836005
upon an objective measurement|410518001|272391002|260224007|272391002
of differences|263735002
between the affected|247591002|248448006
or
at-risk limb|410519009|66019005|410519009|243996003
at the opposite unaffected limb,|66019005|243996003
e.g.|258795003

in volume|118565006|419569009
or
circumference.|74551000

Unfortunately,
there
is
no generally
accepted|385645004
worldwide criterion
of difference|263735002
definitively diagnostic|439401001|261004008
,
although
a volume difference|118565006|263735002|419569009|263735002
of 200 ml|259035002
between limbs|66019005
or
a 4-cm difference|260308009|263735002
(
at a single measurement site|125681006|397987002|50607009|397987002
or
set intervals|385673002
along the limb|66019005|243996003
)
is
often|70232002
used.|394850002

Recently,|6493001
the technique|272394005
of bioimpedance measurement|272391002
(
which
measures|246445000|367346004
the amount|107651007
of fluid|32457005|33463005|255765007
in a limb|66019005|243996003
)
has
been
shown
to
have
greater sensitivity|263768009|35209006|263768009|365705006
than these existing methods,|260686004|272394005
and
holds|421139008
promise
as a simple diagnostic|13673007|439401001|13673007|261004008
and
screening tool.|20135006|86967005

Impedance analysers specifically|246263003|80617005
designed
for this purpose|363675004
are
now commercially available.|103328004

Whether primary|63161005|261424001
or
secondary, lymphedema|28590005
develops
in stages,|261612004
from mild|255604002
to severe.|24484000

Methods|260686004|272394005
of staging|72589006
are
numerous|260396001
and
inconsistent|260380004
across the globe.|81745001|244486005

Systems|246333005
of staging lymphedema range|72589006|234097001
from three|421291004
to
as
many
as eight stages.|421825006|261612004

A staging system|246231009
was
described
in 2007
by Lee,
Morgan|304616007
and
Bergan[10]
and
endorsed
by the American Society
of Lymphology._[citation
needed|410525008|103325001

This system|246333005
provides
a clear technique|263707001|272394005
which
can
be
employed|224363007
by clinical|58147004
and
laboratory assessments|261904005|386053000
to more accurately|242762006
diagnose|439401001
and
prescribe therapy|276239002
for lymphedema,|234097001
as well as
obtain|398092000
measurable outcomes.|394617004

In this improved version,|385425000|22303008|3442003|22303008
four stages|421534005|261612004
are
identified|7882003
(I-IV|42146005|22971001
).

Clear descriptors|263707001|272099008
of symptoms
and
clinical presentation|58147004|246105001
must
be
established|263748003|385645004
at the assessment|386053000
by the physician to|309343006
prescribe
interventions,|225334002
monitor efficacy|13288007
and
support|9096001|243114000
medical necessity.|74188005

Physicians|309343006
and
researchers
can
use|277889008|419385000
additional laboratory assessments,|260364009|261904005|386053000
such as bioimpedance,
MRI,|113091000
or
CT,
to
build
on the findings|404684003
of a clinical assessment|58147004|386053000
(physical evaluation|5880005|5880005|386053000|19388002|19388002|386053000
).

From this,
results|394617004
of therapy|276239002
can
be
accurately
be
determined
and
reported|229059009|223458004
in documentation,|23745001
as well as
in research.

Risk|30207005
and
latency|44104002
is
a different measurement.|263735002|272391002

The most common method|4757001|72906007|260686004|4757001|72906007|272394005
of staging|72589006
was
defined
by the Fifth|32088001
WHO Expert Committee
on Filariasis|105706003
:
[11][12]

Lymphedema|234097001
can
also
be
categorized
by its severity|272141005
(usually
referenced
to a healthy extremity|263775005|66019005
)
:

Treatment|276239002|416118004
for lymphedema|234097001
varies
depending
on the severity|272141005
of the edema|423666004
and
the degree|258395000|246173007
of fibrosis|263756000
of the affected limb.|247591002|66019005|247591002|243996003|248448006|66019005|248448006|243996003

Most people|125676002
with lymphedema|234097001
follow|367409002|421939007
a daily regimen|69620002
of treatment|276239002|416118004
as
suggested
by their physician|309343006
or
certified lymphedema therapist.|234097001

The most common treatments|4757001|72906007|276239002
for lymphedema|234097001
are
a combination|89780004
of manual compression lymphatic massage,|87982008|71173004|83555006|387854002|87982008|263720003|83555006|387854002
compression garments|71173004|272180002|263720003|272180002
or
bandaging.|182555002

Complex decongestive physiotherapy|103360007|91251008
is
an empiric system|246333005
of lymphatic massage,|83555006|387854002
skin care,|225360001
and
compressive garments.|272180002

Although
a combination treatment program|89780004|276239002|89780004|416118004
may
be
ideal,
any
of the treatments|276239002
can
be
done
individually.

Elastic compression garments|71173004|272180002|263720003|272180002
are
worn
by persons|125676002
with lymphedema|234097001
on the affected limb|247591002|66019005|247591002|243996003|248448006|66019005|248448006|243996003
following|255260001
complete decongestive therapy to|255594003|276239002
maintain|385630006
edema reduction.|183328002

Inelastic garments|272180002
have
also
been
shown
to
provide
containment
and
reduction.|58294000|260400001|289928003

Compression pump technology|71173004|44668000|263720003|44668000
utilizes
a multi-chambered pneumatic sleeve|260396001
with overlapping cells to|24846002|4421005
promote
movement|255324009
of lymph fluid.|38000004

Pump therapy|44668000|276239002
may
be
used|394850002
in addition|260364009
to other treatments|74964007|276239002
such as compression bandaging|413899004
and
manual lymph drainage.|229487007

In many cases,|398241000|413769002
pump therapy|44668000|276239002
may
help
soften fibrotic tissue|35828005|263756000|85756007
and
therefore potentially
enable|225791005
more efficient lymphatic drainage.|242762006|260375008|234303003

Compression bandaging,|413899004
also called wrapping,|262318008
is
the application|410618006
of several layers|261028005
of padding|257889009
and
short-stretch bandages|359530003|122546009|63995005|367450005|122546009|63995005
to the involved areas.|248448006|42798000

Short-stretch bandages|359530003|122546009|63995005|367450005|122546009|63995005
are
preferred|225773000
over long-stretch bandages|255511005|122546009|63995005
(
such as those normally
used|394850002
to
treat|395077000
sprains|384709000
)
,
as
the long-stretch bandages|255511005|122546009|63995005
cannot
produce
the proper therapeutic tension necessary to safely|262202000|53489000
reduce|260400001
lymphedema|234097001
and
may
in fact end|261782000|422117008
up producing
a tourniquet effect.|38141007|253861007

During activity,|48761009|55561003|258745004|257733005
whether exercise|61686008
or
daily activities,|69620002|257733005
the short-stretch bandages|359530003|122546009|63995005|367450005|122546009|63995005
enhance
the pumping action|44668000|129264002
of the lymph vessels|83555006
by providing increased resistance|35105006|30714006|260366006|30714006
for them to
push|420620005
against.

This encourages lymphatic flow|83555006
and
helps
to
soften|35828005
fluid-swollen areas.|32457005|442672001|42798000|33463005|442672001|42798000|255765007|442672001|42798000|442672001|42798000

A Stanford University medical study|224871002|74188005|110465008|224871002|74188005|224699009
showed
patients|116154003
receiving
the combined modalities of manual lymph drainage (MLD)|89780004|229487007
with complete decongestive therapy (CDT)|255594003|276239002
and
pneumatic pumping|44668000
had
a greater overall reduction|263768009|58294000|263768009|260400001|263768009|289928003
in limb volume|66019005|118565006|66019005|419569009|243996003|118565006|243996003|419569009
than patients|116154003
receiving
only MLD/CDT.|50607009|229487007|255594003|276239002|420295001|229487007|255594003|276239002

In extremely rare cases,|84638005|398241000|84638005|413769002|103356009|398241000|103356009|413769002
compression pumps|71173004|44668000|263720003|44668000
may
cause|23981006|134198009
additional swelling|260364009|423666004|260364009|442672001
in the lower torso region|261122009|262225004
when
used|394850002
on persons|125676002
with significant lower extremity lymphedema.|386134007|403385000

CDT
is
a primary tool|63161005|86967005|261424001|86967005
in lymphedema management|234097001|413454004|234097001|119270007
consisting
of manual manipulation|87982008|129408000
of the lymphatic ducts,|181767004
[14] short-stretch compression bandaging,|335353000
therapeutic exercise,|229065009
and
skin care.|225360001

The technique|272394005
was
pioneered
by Emil Vodder
in the 1930s
for the treatment|276239002|416118004
of chronic sinusitis|40055000
and
other immune disorders.|74964007|41266007

Initially,|884001
CDT
involves|248448006
frequent visits|70232002
to a certified therapist
with a doctor's prescription.|309343006|260885003

Once the lymphedema|234097001
is
reduced,|260400001
increased patient participation|35105006|225330006|260366006|225330006
is
required
for ongoing care,|255238004
along
with the use|277889008|419385000
of elastic compression garments|71173004|272180002|263720003|272180002
and
nonelastic directional flow foam garments.|255512003|421166008|272180002|260672003|421166008|272180002

Manual manipulation|87982008|129408000
of the lymphatic ducts|181767004
consists
of gentle,
rhythmic massaging|272121000|387854002
of the skin to|119325001|39937001|181469002
stimulate
the flow
of lymph|38000004
and
its return|7528007
to the blood circulation system.|87612001|113257007|119273009|113257007

In the blood?s passage|87612001|255592004|119273009|255592004
through the kidneys,|64033007|17373004
the excess fluid|423666004|21639008
is
filtered out|116250002|258648006
and
eliminated
from the body|279495008|123037004
through urination.|28278009

The treatment|276239002|416118004
is
very gentle|260358002
and
a typical session
will
involve|248448006
drainage|307488001|122462000
of the neck,|45048000|302550007
trunk,|22943007|262225004
and
involved extremity|248448006|66019005
(
in
that order
)
,
lasting
approximately 40|26175008|259031006
to 60 minutes.|258701004|255507004|356624006

CDT
is
generally effective|255403003|254648000
on nonfibrotic lymphedema|234097001
and
less effective|276139006|255403003|276139006|254648000|263796003|255403003|263796003|254648000
on more fibrotic legs,|242762006|263756000|30021000
although
it
has
been
shown
to
help
break up fibrotic tissue.|255532002|263756000|85756007|353734004|263756000|85756007

Several effective surgical procedures|261028005|255403003|83578000|261028005|254648000|83578000
exist
to
provide
long-term solutions|8537005
for patients|116154003
who
suffer
from lymphedema.|234097001

Prior to any lymphedema surgery,|234097001|83578000
patients typically|116154003
have
been
treated|28995006
by a physical therapist|36682004
trained|118629009|62193008
in providing lymphedema treatment|234097001|276239002|234097001|416118004
for initial conservative treatment|884001|276239002|884001|416118004|232714002|276239002|232714002|416118004
of their lymphedema.|234097001

CDT,
MLD|396338004
and
compression bandaging|413899004
are
all helpful components|246093002
of conservative lymphedema treatment.|234097001|276239002|234097001|416118004

With the possibilities
of advanced microsurgical techniques,|86005002|272394005
lymph vessels|83555006
can
be
sutured|408099007|29684008
and
used|394850002
as grafts,|24486003
a well-known technique|20572008|36692007|272394005
in vascular surgery.|408463005

A locally
interrupted|261017006
or
obstructed lymphatic pathway,|263821009|83555006
mostly
after
resection|118292001|128303001
of lymph nodes,|59441001
can
be
reconstructed
by a bypass
using|260676000
lymphatic vessels.|83555006

These vessels|59820001
are
specialized|67995009
to
drain|32712000
lymph|38000004
by active pumping forces.|55561003|44668000

These grafts|24486003
are
connected
with main lymphatic collectors|63161005|83555006
in front|255549009
and
behind the obstruction.|26036001

The technique|272394005
is
mostly
used|394850002
in arm edemas|102558002
after treatment|276239002|416118004
of mammary carcinomas|254838004
and
in unilateral edemas|66459002|423666004
of lower extremities|61685007
after resection|118292001|128303001
of lymphnodes|59441001
and
radiation.|30821001|82107009|108290001

The method|260686004|272394005
was
developed
experimentally
at the Institute|385437003
of Experimental Surgery,|83578000
the Ludwig Maximilians University (LMU)|224871002
in Munich.

It
was
introduced|127487003
as treatment|276239002|416118004
in 1980
by Prof.

Ruediger Baumeister.[15]

The method|260686004|272394005
is
proved to|277025001
be
effective.|255403003|254648000

Follow-up studies|308273005|110465008|308273005|224699009
showed
significant reduction|386134007|58294000|386134007|260400001|386134007|289928003
of volume|118565006|419569009
of the extremities even 10 years|66019005|258707000|2592007|258707000
after surgery.[17]|83578000

The patients,|116154003
who
had
been
previously
treated|28995006
with
both
MLD|396338004
and
compression therapy,|263720003
gained|35105006|255396000|260366006|260369004|398092000
significant improvements|386134007
in quality|263496004
of life|224130005
after
being
treated|28995006
with lymphatic vessel grafting.|83555006|24486003|83555006|119561005|279089004|24486003|279089004|119561005

Lymphoscintigraphic investigations|169167001|386053000
at the Clinic|35971002|257585005
of Nuclear Medicine|394649004|373205008|371572003
at LMU
showed
a lasting enhancement|418393006
of lymphatic transport|83555006|57188001|83555006|360300001
after grafting.[19]|24486003|119561005

The patency|56116003
of lymphatic grafts|83555006|24486003
have
been
demonstrated
by the Institute|385437003
for Clinical Radiology|58147004|394914008|58147004|58147004|363680008
after
more
than 12 years,|258707000
using|260676000
indirect lymphography|255541007|42687005
and
MRI lymphography.|113091000|42687005

Vascularized lymph node transfers|255451006|59441001|302265009|255451006|181756000|302265009
can
be
an effective method|255403003|260686004|255403003|272394005|254648000|260686004|254648000|272394005
for the treatment|276239002|416118004
of lymphedema|234097001
of the arm|40983000|53120007|182245002|302538001
and
upper extremity.|53120007

Lymph nodes|59441001
are
harvested
from the groin area|255575008|42798000
with their supporting artery|9096001|51114001|9096001|11527006|243114000|51114001|243114000|11527006
and
vein|29092000|181367001
and
moved|384598002|370125004
to the axilla|422543003|361288001|362732006
(armpit|422543003|361288001
).

Microsurgeons
use|277889008|419385000
specialized microsurgical techniques to|67995009|272394005|272394005
reconnect
the artery|51114001|11527006
and
vein|29092000|181367001
to new blood vessels|7147002|59820001
in the axilla to|422543003|361288001|362732006
provide
vital support|260410005|9096001|260410005|243114000
to the lymph nodes|59441001
while
they
develop
their own blood supply|87612001|425398004|119273009|425398004
over the first few weeks|255216001|258705008|232714002|258705008
after surgery.|83578000

The newly transferred lymph nodes then|129347002|59441001
serve
as a conduit|257281002
or
filter|116250002|258648006
to
remove|127485006
the excess lymphatic fluid|423666004|83555006|21639008|83555006
from the arm|40983000|53120007|182245002|302538001
and
return|7528007
it
to the body's natural circulation.|279495008|510009|413854007|123037004|510009|413854007

This technique|272394005
of lymph node|59441001|181756000
transfer|129347002|302265009|129005007
usually
is
performed|398166005
together with a DIEP flap breast reconstruction.|425650004|256683004|33496007

This
allows
for both
the simultaneous treatment|79970003|276239002|79970003|416118004
of the arm lymphedema
and
the creation|410615009
of a breast|76752008|181131000
in one surgery.|421379005|83578000

The lymph node transfer|59441001|302265009|181756000|302265009
removes|127485006
the excess lymphatic fluid to|423666004|83555006|21639008|83555006
return|7528007
form|246176004
and
function|246464006
to the arm.|40983000|53120007|182245002|302538001

In selected cases,|398241000|413769002
the lymph nodes|59441001
may
be
transferred|129347002
as a group|261586004|160481000|389109008
with their supporting artery|9096001|51114001|9096001|11527006|243114000|51114001|243114000|11527006
and
vein,|29092000|181367001
but
without the associated abdominal tissue|47429007|277112006|85756007
for breast reconstruction.|33496007

Lymph node transfers|59441001|302265009|181756000|302265009
are
most effective|4757001|255403003|4757001|254648000
in patients|116154003
whose extremity circumference|66019005|74551000
reduces|260400001
significantly
with compression wrapping,|71173004|262318008|263720003|262318008
indicating|410535002
most
of the edema|423666004
is
fluid.|32457005|33463005|255765007

Lymphaticovenous anastomosis (LA)|41796003|257741005
can
be
an effective|255403003|254648000
and
long-term solution|8537005|77899000
for extremity lymphedema,|66019005|234097001
and
many patients|260396001|116154003
have
results|394617004
which range
from a moderate improvement|6736007
to an almost
complete|255594003
resolution
of the problem.|55607006

LAs|417431007
are
most effective|4757001|255403003|4757001|254648000
in patients|116154003
whose extremity circumference|66019005|74551000
reduces|260400001
significantly
with compression wrapping,|71173004|262318008|263720003|262318008
indicating|410535002
most
of the edema|423666004
is
fluid.|32457005|33463005|255765007

Patients|116154003
who
do
not
respond
to compression|71173004|263720003
are
less likely to|276139006|2931005|263796003|2931005
fare
well|20572008
with LA,
as
a greater amount|263768009|107651007
of their increased extremity volume|35105006|66019005|118565006|35105006|66019005|419569009|260366006|66019005|118565006|260366006|66019005|419569009

of obstructive lymphedema|263821009|234097001
in the extremities.|66019005|2592007

In 2003,
Dr.|309343006

Isao Koshima,
a pioneer
in the field|52101004|255798002|18720000|255798002

with his colleagues,
vastly
improved|385425000|3442003
the surgery|83578000
with supermicrosurgical techniques|272394005
and
established|263748003|385645004
the new standard|7147002
in reconstructive microsurgery.|10724008

an effective lymphedema treatment|255403003|234097001|276239002|255403003|234097001|416118004|254648000|234097001|276239002|254648000|234097001|416118004
without recurrence.|246455001

Long-term followup|308273005
(11 ? 13 years|258707000
)
of patients|116154003
with lymphedema|234097001
showed
no recurrence|246455001
of swelling.|423666004|442672001

Lymphatic liposuction|83555006|302441008
when
combined|89780004
with controlled compression therapy|31509003|263720003
was
more effective|242762006|255403003|242762006|254648000
than controlled compression therapy alone to|31509003|263720003|105529008
reduce|260400001
lymphedema.[33][34]|234097001|264667004

Lymphatic liposuction|83555006|302441008
has
been
refined
in recent years|6493001|258707000
by
using|260676000
vibrating cannulae|12150006
which
are
finer|3082000
and
more effective|242762006|255403003|242762006|254648000
than previous equipment.|9130008|246137000

In addition,|260364009
the introduction|107733003
of the tourniquet|38141007
and
tumescent technique|442672001|272394005
has
led|88488004|236874000
to minimized blood loss.[1][35]|131148009|250771004

Lymphatic liposuction (LL)|83555006|302441008
uses|277889008|394850002|260676000|419385000
specialized techniques|67995009|272394005|272394005
that
differ
from conventional liposuction procedures|255333006|302441008
which
requires
specialized training.|67995009|118629009|118629009

This surgical procedure|83578000
is
an effective method|255403003|260686004|255403003|272394005|254648000|260686004|254648000|272394005
of reducing|260400001
the size|277049003
and
stiffness|271587009
of the affected extremity.|247591002|66019005|248448006|66019005

However,
LL
is
generally
followed|367409002
by use|277889008|419385000
of compression garments to|71173004|272180002|263720003|272180002
prevent
a recurrence|246455001
of the lymphedema.|234097001

Low-level laser therapy (LLLT)|229565001
was
cleared|84989007
by the
US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)|255620007|18629005
for the treatment|276239002|416118004
of lymphedema|234097001
in November 2006.[36]

According to the
US National Cancer Institute,|363346000|385437003|372087000|385437003

Studies|110465008|224699009
suggest
that low-level laser therapy|229565001
may
be
effective|255403003|254648000
in reducing lymphedema|260400001|234097001
in a clinically meaningful way
for some women.|224526002

Two cycles|420797005|44180009
of laser treatment|122456005|276239002|122456005|416118004|38586004|276239002|38586004|416118004
were
found|404684003
to
be
effective|255403003|254648000
in reducing|260400001
the volume|118565006|419569009
of the affected arm,|247591002|40983000|247591002|53120007|247591002|182245002|247591002|302538001|248448006|40983000|248448006|53120007|248448006|182245002|248448006|302538001
extracellular fluid,|55450009
and
tissue hardness|85756007|72505002
in approximately one-third|26175008|421379005|70905002
of patients|116154003
with postmastectomy lymphedema|234097001
at 3 months posttreatment.|260313008|258706009

Suggested rationales|410666004
for laser therapy|229565001
include|55919000
a potential decrease|30207005|260400001|30207005|260370003
in fibrosis,|263756000
stimulation|122545008
of macrophages|58986001
and
the immune system,|116003000
and
a possible role|371930009|60022001
in encouraging lymphangiogenesis.[37][38]|264670000

In 2008,
an NIH study|110465008|224699009
revealed|263857004
early diagnosis|264499004|439401001|264499004
of lymphedema in breast cancer patients|234097001|254837009|116154003|234097001|254838004|116154003
(stage 0|261613009
in the article
)
associated|47429007
with an early intervention,|423637002
a compression sleeve|71173004|263720003
and
gauntlet
for one month,|421379005|258706009|421379005|259036001
led|88488004|236874000
to a return|7528007
to preoperative baseline status.|262068006|263490005

In a five-year followup,|421820001|258707000|308273005|421820001|259039008|308273005
patients|116154003
remained
at their preoperative baseline,|262068006
suggesting
preclinical detection
of lymphedema|234097001
can
halt
if
not
reverse
its progression.|246453008|246450006

When
the lymphatic impairment|83555006|40226000
becomes
so great|223528007|255509001|223528007|263768009
that
the lymph fluid|38000004
exceeds
the lymphatic system's ability to|89890002|371150009
transport|57188001|360300001
it,
an abnormal amount|263654008|107651007
of protein-rich fluid collects|88878007|224166006|32457005|88878007|224166006|33463005|88878007|224166006|255765007|88878007|224166006
in the tissues|85756007
of the affected area.|247591002|42798000|248448006|42798000

Left|7771000
untreated,|25265005
this stagnant, protein-rich fluid|88878007|224166006|32457005|88878007|224166006|33463005|88878007|224166006|255765007|88878007|224166006
causes|134198009
tissue|85756007
channels|255592004
to
increase|260366006
in size|277049003
and
number,|410680006|410681005
reducing|260400001
the availability|103328004
of oxygen.|24099007

This
interferes|78235001
with wound healing|298005009
and
provides
a rich culture medium|224166006|421955000
for bacterial growth|88458008
that
can
result|394617004
in infections
:
cellulitis,|128045006
lymphangitis,|1415005
lymphadenitis,|19471005
and
in severe cases,|24484000|398241000|24484000|413769002
skin ulcers.|46742003

It
is
vital|260410005
for lymphedema patients to|234097001|116154003
be
aware|312012004
of the symptoms
of infection
and
to
seek
treatment|276239002|416118004
at the first signs,|276131009
since
recurrent infections|255227004
or
cellulitis,|128045006
in addition|260364009
to their inherent danger,
further|46053002
damage|37782003
the lymphatic system|89890002
and
set up|255532002|353734004
a vicious circle.|354652004

In rare cases,|84638005|398241000|84638005|413769002|103356009|398241000|103356009|413769002
lymphedema|234097001
can
lead|88488004
to a form|246176004
of cancer|363346000|372087000
called
lymphangiosarcoma,|403986008
although
the mechanism|257544000
of carcinogenesis
is
not
understood.|66216009

Lymphedema-associated lymphangiosarcoma|234097001|47429007|403986008
is
called Stewart-Treves syndrome.|62497000

Lymphangiosarcoma most frequently|403986008|70232002
occurs|272120004
in cases|398241000|413769002
of long-standing lymphedema.|255511005|10904000|234097001

The incidence
of angiosarcoma|403977003
is
estimated to|414135002
be
0.45%
in patients|116154003
living|224130005|419749002
5 years|264706000|258707000|264605009|258707000
after radical mastectomy.|384723003

Lymphedema|234097001
is
also
associated|47429007
with a low grade form|246176004
of cancer|363346000|372087000
called
retiform hemangioendothelioma|403982005
(
a low grade angiosarcoma|403977003
).[41]

Since
lymphedema|234097001
is
disfiguring,
causes|134198009
difficulties|371157007
in daily living|69620002
and
can
lead|88488004
to lifestyle|60134006
becoming
severely|24484000
limited|255469002
,
it
may
also
result|394617004
in psychological distress.|60224009|69328002
