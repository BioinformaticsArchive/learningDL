*Hypertrichosis|399939002|271607001
*
*
(also
called
*
*Ambras syndrome
*
*
)
is
an abnormal amount|263654008|107651007
of hair growth|88911008
on the body|279495008|123037004
;[1][2] extensive cases|303183002|41118005|398241000|303183002|41118005|413769002
of hypertrichosis|399939002|271607001
have
informally
been
called
*
*werewolf syndrome
*
*,
[3]|260313008
because
the appearance|386548000|255412001
is
similar
to the mythological werewolf.

The two distinct types|420797005|261664005
of hypertrichosis|399939002|271607001
are
generalized|60132005
hypertrichosis,|399939002|271607001
which
occurs|272120004
over the entire body,|255503000|279495008|255503000|123037004|260232004|279495008|260232004|123037004
and
localized hypertrichosis,|255471002|399939002|255471002|271607001
which
is
restricted|263856008
to a certain area.|17162000|42798000

Hypertrichosis|399939002|271607001
can
be
either
congenital|6160004|255399007
(present|52101004|246105001
at birth|3950001
)
or
acquired later in life.|255396000|260383002|224130005

The excess growth|260378005
of hair|386045008|119326000
occurs|272120004
in areas|42798000
of the skin|119325001|39937001|181469002
with the exception
of androgen-dependent hair|66349002|371154000|386045008|66349002|371154000|119326000
of the pubic area,|11708003
face,|89545001|302549007
and
axillary regions.[5]|422543003

Several circus sideshow performers|261028005|106323001
in the 19th
and
early 20th centuries,|264499004
such as Julia Pastrana,
had
hypertrichosis.|399939002|271607001

Many
of them
worked|261041009
as freaks
and
were
promoted
as
having
distinct human|278412004
and
animal traits.|387961004

The first recorded case|255216001|398241000|232714002|398241000
of hypertrichosis|399939002|271607001
was
Petrus Gonsalvus
of the Canary Islands.|223365008

This
was
documented|397934002
by Altrovandus
in the late 15th century|260383002
and
published
in his text Montrorum Historia cum Paralipomenis historiae omnium animalium|20401003
published
in 1642.

He
noted two daughters,|420797005|66089001
a son,|65616008
and
a grandchild|86372007
in Gonzales' family|35359004
all
had
hypertrichosis.|399939002|271607001

Altrovandus
dubbed
them the Ambras family,|35359004
after
the Ambras Castle|224641008
near Innsbruck,
where
portraits
of the family|35359004
were
found.|404684003

During the next 300 years,|18769003|258707000|255260001|258707000
about 50 cases|398241000|413769002
were
observed.

The scientist Rudolf Virchow|308027003
described
a form|246176004
of hypertrichosis|399939002|271607001
accompanied
by gingival hyperplasia|441798003
in 1873.[7]

Two methods|420797005|260686004|420797005|272394005
of classification|73504009
are
used|394850002
for hypertrichosis.|399939002|271607001

One divides|421379005|422033008
them
into
either
generalized|60132005
versus
localized hypertrichosis,|255471002|399939002|255471002|271607001
while
the other divides|74964007|422033008
them
into congenital|6160004|255399007
versus
acquired.[1][9]|255396000

Congenital forms|6160004|246176004|255399007|246176004
of hypertrichosis|399939002|271607001
are
caused|23981006|134198009
by genetic mutations,|55446002
and
are
extremely rare,|84638005|103356009
unlike acquired forms.|255396000|246176004

Congenital hypertrichosis|201163007|56797000
is
always
present|52101004|246105001
at birth.[3]|3950001

Congenital hypertrichosis lanuginosa|201163007
is
noticeable
at birth,|3950001
with the infant completely|418119000
covered|255334000
in thin lanugo hair.|247546006|247524003|18043004|247524003

In normal circumstances,|17621005|258744000
lanugo hair|247524003
is
shed
before birth|3950001
and
replaced|282089006|370124000
by vellus hair|89714002|319720006
;
however,
in a person|125676002
with congenital hypertrichosis lanuginosa,|201163007
the lanugo hair|247524003
remains
after birth.|237679004|3950001|288563008|3950001

The palms|107631008
of the hands,|85562004
soles|57999000
of the feet,|56459004|259051005
and
mucous membranes|313268005
are
not
affected.|247591002|248448006

As the person ages,|125676002|424144002
the lanugo hair|247524003
may
thin,|18043004
leaving|7771000|90737002
only limited areas|50607009|255471002|420295001|255471002
of hypertrichosis.[7]|399939002|271607001

Congenital generalized hypertrichosis|201163007|60132005|56797000|60132005
causes|134198009
males to|248153007
exhibit
excessive facial|260378005|89545001
and
upper body hair,|128262006|386045008|128262006|119326000
whereas
women|224526002
exhibit
less severe asymmetrical hair distribution.|276139006|24484000|4128009|386045008|255464007|276139006|24484000|4128009|119326000|255464007|263796003|24484000|4128009|386045008|255464007|263796003|24484000|4128009|119326000|255464007

The palms,|107631008
soles,|57999000
and
mucous membranes|313268005
are
not
affected.[1]|247591002|248448006

Congenital terminal hypertrichosis|201163007|42796001|56797000|42796001
is
characterized
by the presence|386397008
of fully
pigmented|300597003
terminal hair|41376008|319813006
that
covers|255334000
the entire body.|255503000|279495008|255503000|123037004|260232004|279495008|260232004|123037004

This condition|260905004
is
usually
accompanied
by gingival hyperplasia.|441798003

This form|246176004
is
most responsible|4757001|394851003
for the term "werewolf syndrome"
because of the thick, dark hair|48610005|255419005
that
appears.

People|125676002
with this condition|260905004
are
sometimes
performers|420158005
at circuses|285083000|396826001
because of their unusual appearance.[3]|386548000|255412001

Congenital circumscribed hypertrichosis|201163007|355648006|56797000|355648006
is
associated|47429007
with the presence|386397008
of thick vellus hair|48610005
on the upper extremities.|53120007

Circumscribed|355648006
signifies
this type|261664005
of hypertrichosis|399939002|271607001
is
restricted|263856008
to certain parts|17162000|260726005
of the body,|279495008|123037004
in this case,|398241000
the extrasensory surfaces|410678000
of the upper extremities.|53120007

Hairy elbow syndrome,|386045008|127949000|386045008|16953009|386045008|76248009|119326000|127949000|119326000|16953009|119326000|76248009
a type|261664005
of congenital circumscribed hypertrichosis,|201163007|355648006|56797000|355648006
shows
excessive growth|260378005
on
and
around the elbows.|127949000

This type|261664005
of hypertrichosis|399939002|271607001
is
present|52101004|246105001
at birth,|3950001
becomes
more prominent|242762006|4657009
during aging,|248280005
and
regresses
at puberty.[11]|18991001

Congenital localized hypertrichosis|201163007|255471002|56797000|255471002
is
a localized increase|255471002|260366006
in hair density|386045008|125146005|119326000|125146005
and
length.[4]|410668003

Nevoid hypertrichosis|201161009
may
be
present|52101004|246105001
at birth|3950001
or
appear
later in life.|224130005

It
features
an isolated area|46651001|42798000
of excessive terminal hair|260378005|41376008|260378005|319813006
and
is
usually
not
related|272151006|262094002
to any other diseases.[3][12]|74964007|64572001

Acquired hypertrichosis|255396000|399939002|255396000|271607001
appears
after birth.|237679004|3950001|288563008|3950001

The multiple causes|260396001|134198009
include|55919000
the side effects
of drugs,|410942007
associations|263534001
with cancer,|363346000|372087000
and
possible links|371930009|60022001
with eating disorders.|72366004

Acquired forms|255396000|246176004
can
usually
be
reduced|260400001
with various treatments.|256220008|276239002

Acquired hypertrichosis lanuginosa
is
characterized
by rapid growth|255358001
of lanugo hair,|247524003
particularly
on the face.|89545001|302549007

Hair also|386045008|119326000
appears
on the trunk|22943007|262225004
and
armpits,|422543003
while
palms|107631008
and
soles|57999000
are
unaffected.

The excess hair|271607001
is
commonly
referred|439980006
to
as
malignant|21594007
down.

This hair|386045008|119326000
is
very fine|260358002|3082000
and
unpigmented.[14]

Acquired|255396000
generalized hypertrichosis commonly|60132005|399939002|60132005|271607001
affects|4065008
the cheeks,|60819002
upper lip,|11681001|245776003
and
chin.|30291003|362632004

This form also|246176004
affects|4065008
the forearms|14975008
and
legs,|30021000
but
is
less common|276139006|72906007|263796003|72906007
in these areas.|42798000

Another deformity|276654001|127560004|417893002
associated|47429007
with acquired generalized hypertrichosis|255396000|60132005|399939002|255396000|60132005|271607001
is
multiple hairs|260396001|386045008
occupying
the same follicle.|262126009|24162005|262126009|67290009

It
may
also
include|55919000
abnormal hair growth patterns|85305001|272135003
as
what happens
to the eyelashes|85803001
in a condition|260905004
known|36692007
as trichiasis.|60332004

Oral minoxidil treatments|260548002|387272001|276239002
for hypertension|38341003
are
known|36692007
to
cause|23981006|134198009
this condition.|260905004

Topical minoxidil|387272001|359540000|387272001
used|394850002
for alopecia|278040002
causes|134198009
hair growth|88911008
in the areas|42798000
where it
is
applied,|410618006
however
this hair|386045008|119326000
disappears
shortly
after
discontinuing|410546004|421286000
the use|277889008|419385000
of topical minoxidil.[15]|387272001|359540000|387272001

Acquired|255396000
patterned hypertrichosis|272135003|399939002|272135003|271607001
is
an increase|260366006
in hair growth|88911008
in a pattern formation.|272135003|11798007|272135003|255277001

It
is
similar
to acquired generalized hypertrichosis|255396000|60132005|399939002|255396000|60132005|271607001
and
is
a sign|72670004
of internal malignancy.[5]|260521003|363346000|260521003|372087000

Acquired|255396000
localized hypertrichosis|255471002|399939002|255471002|271607001
is
an increase|260366006
in hair density|386045008|125146005|119326000|125146005
and
length|410668003
often secondary|70232002|2603003|70232002|81170007
to irritation|257553007
or
trauma.

This form|246176004
is
restricted|263856008
to certain areas|17162000|42798000
of the body.|279495008|123037004

Hypertrichosis|399939002|271607001
is
often mistakenly|70232002
classified|73504009
as hirsutism.|399939002

Hirsutism|399939002
is
a type|261664005
of hypertrichosis|399939002|271607001
exclusive
to women|224526002
and
children,|410601007|160499008
resulting|42752001
from an excess|260378005
of androgen-sensitive hair growth.|247536009|83185005

Patients|116154003
with hirsutism exhibit patterns|399939002|272135003
of adult male hair growth.|133936004|248153007|88911008

Chest|261179002
and
back hair|386045008|119326000
are
often|70232002
present|52101004|246105001
on women|224526002
with hirsutism.[17]|399939002

Hirsutism|399939002
is
both congenital|6160004|255399007
and
acquired.|255396000

It
is
linked
to excessive male hormones|246194005|248153007
in women,|224526002
thus symptoms
may
include|55919000
acne,|88616000|11381005
deepening
of the voice,
irregular menstrual periods,|80182007
and
the formation|11798007|255277001
of a more masculine body shape.|242762006|279495008|107644003|242762006|279495008|246176004|242762006|279495008|300842002|242762006|123037004|107644003|242762006|123037004|246176004|242762006|123037004|300842002

Increases|260366006
in androgen|66349002
(male hormone) levels|248153007|365774006
are
the primary cause|63161005|23981006|63161005|134198009|261424001|23981006|261424001|134198009
of most hirsutism cases.|399939002|398241000|399939002|413769002

If
caused|23981006|134198009
by increased levels|35105006|258395000|260366006|258395000
of androgens,|66349002
it
can
be
treated|28995006
with medications|410942007
that
reduce|260400001
androgen levels.|407709006

Some birth control pills|423938009|5935008
and
spironolactone|387078006
reduce|260400001
androgen levels.[17]|407709006

The primary characteristic|63161005|261424001
of all
forms|246176004
of hypertrichosis|399939002|271607001
is
excess hair.|271607001

Hair|386045008|119326000
in hypertrichosis|399939002|271607001
is
usually longer|255511005
than
expected
[9]
and
may
consist
of any hair type|386045008|261664005|119326000|261664005
(lanugo,|247524003
vellus,
or

Congenital hypertrichosis lanuginosa|201163007
may
be
caused|23981006|134198009
by a mutation|55446002
on the 8q chromosome|91272006
;[1] however,|260305007
it
could
also
be
possibly|60022001
the result|394617004
of a spontaneous genetic mutation|5054005|55446002
rather than
inheritance.|246071007

This form|246176004

the skin.[20]|119325001|39937001|181469002

Congenital generalized hypertrichosis|201163007|60132005|56797000|60132005
has
a dominant pattern|272135003
of inheritance|246071007
and
has
been
linked
to chromosome x24-q27.1.|46507000

An affected female|247591002|248152002|247591002|224526002|248448006|248152002|248448006|224526002

Congenital generalized hypertrichosis terminalis|201163007|60132005|56797000|60132005
is
thought to|88952004
be
caused|23981006|134198009
by genetic changes|55446002
on chromosome 17|45201007

in the addition|260364009
or
removal|118292001|128303001
of millions
of nucleotides.|71211001

The gene MAP2K6|67271001
may
be
a factor contributing
to this condition.|260905004

This condition|260905004
may
also
be
due to the change|243326001|263703002

also
linked
to metabolic disorders,|30390004

congenital circumscribed,|6160004|355648006|255399007|355648006
localized|255471002

and
nevoid hypertrichosis|201161009
is

A number|410680006|410681005
of mechanisms|257544000
can
lead|88488004
to hypertrichosis.|399939002|271607001

One cause|421379005|134198009
involves|248448006
areas|42798000
of the skin|119325001|39937001|181469002
that
are
transforming
from the small vellus type|255507004|261664005
to the larger terminal type.|255509001|42796001|261664005|263768009|42796001|261664005

This change normally|243326001|263703002
occurs|272120004
during adolescence,|22396007
when
vellus hair follicles|67290009|89714002|24162005|89714002|67290009|319720006|24162005|319720006|67290009
in the underarms|422543003
and
groin|255575008
grow
into terminal hair follicles.|41376008|24162005|41376008|67290009|319813006|24162005|319813006|67290009|42796001|67290009

Hypertrichosis|399939002|271607001
involves|248448006
this same type|262126009|261664005
of switching,
but
in areas|42798000
that
do
not normally
produce
terminal hair.|41376008|319813006

The mechanisms|257544000
for this switch
are
poorly|556001
understood.[1]|66216009

Another mechanism|257544000
involves|248448006
a change|243326001|263703002
in the hair cycle.|386045008|44180009|119326000|44180009

There
are
three stages|421291004|261612004
of the hair cycle|386045008|44180009|119326000|44180009
:
the anagen phase|21191007
(hair growth|88911008
)
,
the catagen phase|21191007
(hair follicle death|67290009|419620001|67290009|268923008|280830006|419620001|280830006|268923008
)
,
and
the telogen phase|21191007
(hair shedding|386045008|119326000
).

If
the anagen phase|21191007
increases|260366006
beyond what
is
normal|17621005|258744000
;
that region|410673009
of the body|279495008|123037004
will
experience
excessive hair growth.[9]|399939002|271607001

Hypertrichosis|399939002|271607001
is
diagnosed clinically|439401001
via the occurrence|272120004
of hair|386045008|119326000
in excess|260378005
of what
is
expected
for age,|424144002
sex,|258139002|365952006|263495000|70256003|57312000
and
ethnicity|397731000
in areas|42798000
that
are
not androgen-sensitive.|66349002|83185005

The excess|260378005
can
be
in the form|246176004
of excessive length|260378005|410668003
or
density|125146005
and
may
consist
of any hair type|386045008|261664005|119326000|261664005
(lanugo,|247524003

terminal.[19]|42796001

There
is
no cure
for any congenital forms|6160004|246176004|255399007|246176004
of hypertrichosis.|399939002|271607001

The treatment|276239002|416118004
for acquired hypertrichosis|255396000|399939002|255396000|271607001
is
based|418836005
on attempting to
address|397635003
the underlying cause.|134198009

Acquired forms|255396000|246176004
of hypertrichosis|399939002|271607001
have
a variety
of sources,|260753009
and
are
usually
treated|28995006
by removing|127485006
the factor causing hypertrichosis,|23981006|399939002|23981006|271607001
e.g.|258795003

a medication|410942007
with undesired side-effects.

All hypertrichosis,|399939002|271607001
congenital|6160004|255399007
or
acquired,|255396000
can
be
reduced|260400001
through hair removal.|1449002

Hair removal treatments|1449002|276239002
are
categorized
into two principal subdivisions|420797005|63161005|394853000|420797005|302311007|394853000
:
temporary removal|14803004|118292001|14803004|128303001
and
permanent removal.|6934004|118292001|6934004|128303001

Treatment|276239002|416118004
may
have
adverse effects
by causing scarring,|23981006|23981006|275322007
dermatitis,|182782007
or
hypersensitivity.[3]|421961002|421369008

Temporary hair removal|14803004|1449002
may
last
from several hours|261028005|258702006
to several weeks,|261028005|258705008
depending
on the method|260686004|272394005
used.|394850002

These procedures|71388002
are
purely cosmetic.|81024003|261513001

and
produce
results|394617004
that last several hours|258702006
to several days.|261028005|258703001

Epilation methods,|1449002|260686004|1449002|272394005

lasting
several days|261028005|258703001
to several weeks.[28]|261028005|258705008

Permanent hair removal|6934004|1449002
uses|277889008|394850002|260676000|419385000
chemicals,|441900009
energy|248272003

of hair removal|1449002
on
hairs|386045008

Laser|122456005|38586004
cannot
treat|395077000
white hair.|297993006

The Laser|122456005|38586004
targets
the melanin color|59094002|263714004
in the lower 1/3|261122009
of the hair follicle,|67290009|280830006

however,
the generalized form|60132005|246176004
