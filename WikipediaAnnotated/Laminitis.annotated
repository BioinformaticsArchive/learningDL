*Laminitis|370479001
*
*
is
a disease|64572001
that
affects|4065008
the feet|56459004|259051005
of ungulates.

It
is
best known|20572008|36692007|3442003|36692007
in horses|35354009
and
cattle.

Clinical signs|58147004|72670004
include|55919000
lameness,|16973004|275520000
inflammation,|257552002
and
increased temperature|386661006
in the hooves.|18060009

Laminitis|370479001
is
characterized
by inflammation|257552002
of the digital laminae|261006005|88446008|82680008|88446008
of the hoof,|18060009|410026002
and
severe cases|24484000|398241000|24484000|413769002
with outwardly visibly clinical signs|58147004|72670004
are
known|36692007
by the colloquial term _founder_.|44066000

The digital laminae|261006005|88446008|82680008|88446008
are
responsible|394851003
for suspension|7946007|37595005|385655000
of the axial skeleton|6834003
of the animal|387961004
within the hooves|18060009
of ungulates,
and
act
as shock absorbers|27942005
during locomotion.

In horses there|35354009
are
about 600 pairs
of interleaved laminae|88446008
:
the epidermal laminae|55988001|88446008
attached|102491009
to the hoof wall|20692006
and
the dermal laminae|119325001|88446008|39937001|88446008|181469002|88446008
attached|102491009
to the coffin bone|370672003|410030004
(
a.k.
a.

PIII,
P3,
the third phalanx,|70905002|28641004|70905002|73696005
pedal bone,|56459004|272673000|56459004|3138006|56459004|90780006|56459004|128530007
or
distal phalanx|299711006
).[1]|260305007

Laminitis literally means inflammation|370479001|255586005|257552002
of the laminae,|88446008
and
while
it
remains
controversial
whether
this
is
the primary mechanism|63161005|257544000|261424001|257544000
of disease,|64572001
evidence|18669006
of inflammation|257552002
occurs|272120004
very early|260358002|264499004
in some instances
of the disease.[2]|64572001

Laminitis|370479001
is
characterized
by a 'compromise
in the interaction'
of the Laminae|88446008
between the hoof wall|20692006
and
the coffin bone,|370672003|410030004
the mechanism|257544000
of which
remains
unclear
and
is
currently|15240007
the subject
of much research.

Laminitis|370479001
can
be
either
mechanical|261018001
or
systemic.|31099001

Mechanical laminitis starts|261018001|370479001|255395001
when
the hoof wall|20692006
is
pulled away|303370007
from the bone|272673000|3138006|90780006|128530007
or
lost,
as
a result|394617004
of external influences.|261074009

Mechanical laminitis|261018001|370479001
can
occur|272120004
when
a horse habitually paws,|35354009|95936004|388441000|95936004|388445009|95936004
is
ridden
or
driven|129060000|247750002
on hard surfaces|72505002|410678000
(
or
loses
laminar function,|88446008|246464006
due to an injury
or
pathologies|394595002
affecting|247591002|248448006
the hoof wall|20692006
).

Systemic laminitis|31099001|370479001
is
usually bilateral|51440002
(
on two feet|420797005|56459004|420797005|259051005
)
and
though
it
can
affect|4065008
any number|410680006|410681005
of feet,|56459004|259051005
it
is
most common|4757001|72906007
in the front feet.|255549009|56459004|255549009|259051005

At present there|52101004|246105001
are
three primary hypotheses|421291004|63161005|421291004|261424001
for the mechanism|257544000
that results|394617004
in laminar failure.|88446008|76797004

Systemic Laminitis|31099001|370479001
can
lead|88488004
to rotation|70433009
or
sinking|47044002
and
this in turn|282987006
may
lead|88488004
to abscesses,|128477000
within the hoof capsule,|18060009|385049006|18060009|428641000|410026002|385049006|410026002|428641000
that
can
be
severe|24484000
and
very painful.|260358002|22253000

Depending
upon the severity|272141005
at the onset|77374008
of the pathology,|394595002
there
may
be
no movement|255324009
of the coffin bone,|370672003|410030004
rotation only,|70433009
sinking|47044002
only
or
a combination|89780004
of
both
rotation|70433009
and
sinking,|47044002
to varying extents.|255590007

Normally,
the front|255549009
of the third phalanx|70905002|28641004|70905002|73696005
is
parallel
to the hoof wall|20692006
and
its lower surface|261122009|410678000
should
be
roughly
parallel
to the ground surface.|15537006|410678000

A single severe laminitic episode|229803000|24484000
or
repeated less severe episodes|27582007|24484000|272128006
can
,
depending
upon the degree|258395000|246173007
of separation|16640008|160788005
of dermal|119325001|39937001|181469002
and
epidermal laminae,|55988001|88446008
lead|88488004
to
either
*
*Rotation|70433009
*
*
or
*
*Sinking|47044002
*
*
of the pedal bone,|56459004|272673000|56459004|3138006|56459004|90780006|56459004|128530007
both
of which
result|394617004
in anatomical changes|36298004|243326001|36298004|263703002
in the position|246449006
of the coffin bone|370672003|410030004
with visible separation|24054004|16640008|24054004|160788005
of the laminae colloquially|88446008
known|36692007
as
*
*founder|44066000
*
*.

Rotation|70433009
occurs|272120004
when
the damage|37782003
to the laminae|88446008
is
less severe|276139006|24484000|263796003|24484000
and
it
will
show
up mainly
in the toe area|29707007|42798000|302547009|42798000
of the foot.|56459004|259051005|302545001

The degree|258395000|246173007
of rotation|70433009
may
be
determined
by severity|272141005
of the initial attack|884001|217315002|884001|216299002|232714002|217315002|232714002|216299002
or
by
how
soon laminitis|370479001
is
detected|260373001
and
how soon actions|129264002
are
taken|419652001
to
treat|395077000
the horse.|35354009|388441000|388445009

A combination|89780004
of forces
(
e.g.
,
the tension|53489000
of the deep digital flexor tendon|131197000|261006005|77685001|131197000|261006005|330518008|131197000|82680008|77685001|131197000|82680008|330518008
and
the weight|27113001|272102008|39857003
of the horse|35354009|388441000|388445009
)
result|394617004
in the deep digital flexor tendon,|131197000|261006005|77685001|131197000|261006005|330518008|131197000|82680008|77685001|131197000|82680008|330518008
literally pulling|303370007
the dorsal face|255551008|89545001|255551008|302549007
of the coffin bone away|370672003|410030004
from the inside of the hoofwall,|260521003
which
allows
the coffin bone|370672003|410030004
to rotate.|263861005

There
are
also ligaments|52082005
attaching|102491009
the collateral cartilages|397406000|61496007
to the digit,|82680008|361367007
primarily
in the palmar portion|21547004|260726005|107631008|260726005
of the foot,|56459004|259051005|302545001
possibly|60022001
contributing
to a difference|263735002
in support|9096001|243114000
from front|255549009
to
back.

It
is
also
theorized
that
the body weight|27113001|39857003
of the animal|387961004
contributes
to rotation|70433009
of the coffin bone.|370672003|410030004

Rotation|70433009
results|394617004
in an obvious misalignment|399898009
between PII
(
the short pastern bone|370730008
)
and
PIII
(
the coffin bone|370672003|410030004
).

If rotation|70433009
of the third phalanx|70905002|28641004|70905002|73696005
continues|255238004
,
its tip|233445008
can
eventually
penetrate|53568006
the sole|57999000
of the foot.|56459004|259051005|302545001

Sinking|47044002
is
less common|276139006|72906007|263796003|72906007
and
much more severe.|242762006|24484000|4757001|24484000

It
results|394617004
when
there
is
a significant failure|386134007|76797004
of the interdigitation
between the sensitive|83185005
and
insensitive laminae|88446008
around the entire perimeter|255503000|392540007|255503000|131191004|260232004|392540007|260232004|131191004
of the hoof.|18060009|410026002

The destruction|64597002
of the sensitive laminae|83185005|88446008
results|394617004
in the hoof wall|20692006
becoming
separated|13184001|263869007
from the rest|258157001
of the hoof.|18060009|410026002

Pus|11311000|119323008
may
leak|87952002
out
at the white line|413773004|50009006|185984009|50009006|371251000|50009006
or
at the coronary band.|5695009

In extreme cases|12565001|398241000|12565001|413769002
this event|272379006
allows
the tip|233445008
to eventually
penetrate|53568006
the sole|57999000
of the foot.|56459004|259051005|302545001

Penetration|53568006
of the sole|57999000
is
not inherently fatal|399166001
;
many horses|260396001|35354009
have
been
returned|7528007
to service|224930009
by aggressive treatment|61372001|276239002|61372001|416118004|276239002|416118004
by a veterinarian|106290006
and
farrier,|308321006
but
the treatment|276239002|416118004
is
time-consuming, difficult|410669006|52925006
and
expensive.

It
is
generally
agreed
that
a severe "sinker"|24484000
warrants
the gravest prognosis|91071007|20481000
and
may
,
depending
upon many factors,
including|55919000
the quality|263496004
of after care,|413467001
age|424144002
of the horse,|35354009|388441000|388445009
diet|41829006
and
nutrition,|87276001|384759009
skill,
knowledge|225795001
and
ability|371150009
of the attending veterinarian|106290006
and
farrier|308321006
(s|288495006
)
,
lead|88488004
to euthanasia|28631002
of the patient.|116154003

Laminitis|370479001
has
multiple causes,|260396001|134198009
some
of which commonly
co-occur.|272120004

These causes|134198009
can
be
grouped|255504006
into broad categories.|90522003

The inflammatory molecule histamine|290005005|54235008
has
also
been
hypothesized
as a causative agent|362944004
of laminitis.|370479001

However,
contradictory evidence|18669006
has
demonstrated
that
the role
of histamine|54235008
in laminitis|370479001
has
not
been
conclusively
established.[6]|263748003|385645004

Commonly
known|36692007
as
*
*road founder|272510001|44066000
*
*,
this
occurs|272120004
when
horses|35354009
with long toes|255511005|29707007
are
worked|261041009
extensively
on hard ground.|72505002

The long toes|255511005|29707007
and
hard ground together|72505002
contribute
to delayed
*
*breakover
*
*
and
hence mechanical separation|261018001|16640008|261018001|160788005
of the laminae|88446008
at the toe.|29707007|302547009

Historically
this
was
seen
in carriage horses.|35354009

These horses|35354009
were
bred
for heavy bodies|410712002|279495008|410712002|123037004
and
long slim legs|299222009
with relatively small hooves|255507004|18060009
;
their hooves|18060009
were
trimmed|8378006
for long toes|255511005|29707007
(to
make
them
lift|360304005|258141001
their feet|56459004|259051005
higher,|75540009|371879000
enhancing
their stylish "action"|129264002
)
;
and
they
were
worked|261041009
at speed
on hard roads.|72505002|272510001

Road founder|272510001|44066000
is
also
seen
in overweight animals,|238131007|387961004
particularly
when
hooves|18060009
are
allowed
to
grow
long|255511005
:
classic examples|255333006
are
ponies|3997000
on pasture board
in spring,
and
pregnant mares.[7]|77386006|127362006

in the lower limbs|61685007
of a horse|35354009|388441000|388445009
depends
in part|260726005
on the horse|35354009|388441000|388445009
moving
about.

Lack|41277001
of sufficient movement,|51117008|255324009
alone|105529008
or
in combination|89780004
with other factors,|74964007
can
cause|23981006|134198009
*
*stagnant anoxia|29658002
*
*,
which in turn|282987006
can
cause|23981006|134198009
laminitis.[7]|370479001

A horse favoring|35354009|388441000|388445009
an injured leg|61685007|30021000|182281004|362793004
will
both
severely|24484000
limit|255469002
its movement|255324009
and
place|257557008|421066005
greater weight|263768009|27113001|263768009|272102008|263768009|39857003

This sometimes
leads|88488004|236874000
to
*
*static laminitis|257390007|370479001
*
*,
particularly
if
the animal|387961004
is
confined

is
the 2006 Kentucky Derby winner Barbaro.[8]|224062005

Early diagnosis|264499004|439401001|264499004
is
essential|34325006
to effective treatment.|255403003|276239002|255403003|416118004|254648000|276239002|254648000|416118004

However,
early outward signs|264499004|255543005|72670004
may
be
fairly non-specific.|10003008

Careful physical examination typically|5880005
is
diagnostic,|439401001|261004008
but
radiographs|168537006
are
also very useful.|260358002

A lateral-medial radiograph|49370004|255561001|168537006

In venography,|4970003
a contrast agent|407935004

Rapid diagnosis|255358001|439401001|255358001
of laminitis|370479001
is
often difficult|70232002|52925006

With modern therapies,|276239002
most laminitics
will
be

completely
recover|74822006

if
treated|28995006

live|419749002

In laminitis cases,|370479001|398241000|370479001|413769002
a clear distinction|263707001
must

made
between the acute situation,|272118002
starting|255395001|385652002
at the onset|77374008
of a laminitis attack|370479001|217315002|370479001|216299002

be
either
stable|58158008

unstable|263922001

of vital importance,|260410005
when
choosing
a treatment protocol.|276239002|258049002|416118004|258049002

There

re-establish|228877007|263748003
proper spatial orientation|311552005
of P3
within the hoof capsule,|18060009|385049006|18060009|428641000|410026002|385049006|410026002|428641000
to
ensure
the best long-term prospects|20572008|3442003
for the horse.|35354009|388441000|388445009

With correct trimming|8378006
and
,
as
necessary,
the application|410618006
of orthotics,
one|421379005
can
effect|253861007
this re-orientation.|228877007|43173001|228877007|311552005

However,
this attempt
at re-orientation|228877007|43173001|228877007|311552005
is
not always completely effective.|255403003|254648000

Successful treatment|182985004
for any type|261664005
of founder|44066000
must
necessarily
involve|248448006
stabilization|115979005
of the bony column|263686003
by some means.|255586005

Stabilization|115979005
can
take|419652001
many forms|246176004
but
most
include|55919000
trimming|8378006
the hoof to|18060009|410026002
facilitate
"
break
over"|21481007
and
trimming|8378006
the heels to|76853006
ensure
frog pressure.|47843009|279046003|47843009|13543005|47843009|257893003|107226004|279046003|107226004|13543005|107226004|257893003

While
some horses|35354009
stabilize|409051000
if left barefooted,|7771000
some veterinarians|106290006
believe
that
the most successful methods|4757001|385669000|260686004|4757001|385669000|272394005
of treating founder|28995006|44066000
involve|248448006
positive stabilisation|258758003|115979005|10828004|115979005
of the distal phalanx,|299711006
by mechanical means,|261018001|255586005
e.g.
,
shoes,|43983001
pads,|421823004
polymeric support,|412155002|9096001|412155002|243114000
etc.

Steps|398298007
taken|419652001
to
stabilize|409051000
the bony column gain maximum effect|263686003|398303009|253861007
when
combined|89780004
with steps|398298007
that
will
reduce|260400001
the pulling force|303370007|303370007|285653008
of the deep digital flexor tendon|131197000|261006005|77685001|131197000|261006005|330518008|131197000|82680008|77685001|131197000|82680008|330518008
on the coffin bone.|370672003|410030004

The application|410618006
of external orthotic devices|261074009|224898003
to the foot|56459004|259051005|302545001
in a horse|35354009|388441000|388445009
with non-displaced laminitis|263739008|370479001
and
once displacement|286668001|263739008|276626008
has
occurred|272120004
is
widespread.|85333001

Most approaches|103379005
attempt
to
shift|9546005
weight away|27113001|272102008|39857003
from the laminae|88446008
and
onto secondary weight-bearing structures,|2603003|249981005|81170007|249981005
while
sparing
the sole|57999000

A dorsal hoof wall resection|255551008|20692006|118292001|255551008|20692006|128303001
may
help
in certain conditions|17162000|260905004
after consultation|11429006
with an experienced veterinarian|106290006
and
farrier team.|308321006

If decreased bloodflow distal|21762000|46053002
to the coronary plexus|280515006
is
seen
on a venogram,|4970003
or
when
a laminar wedge|88446008|255296002
forms|246176004
between P3
and
the hoof wall,|20692006
preventing|116699007
the proper re-attachment|228877007|1431002
(interdigitation
of the laminae,|88446008
this procedure|71388002
may
be
beneficial.

When
the coffin bone|370672003|410030004
is
pulled away|303370007
from the hoofwall,
the remaining laminae|88446008
will
tear.|415747007|40431001|312608009

This
may
lead|88488004
to abscesses|128477000
within the hoof capsule|18060009|385049006|18060009|428641000|410026002|385049006|410026002|428641000
that
can
be
severe|24484000
and
very painful,|260358002|22253000
as well as
a mass|300848003|118538004
of disorganized tissue|85756007
called
a laminar|88446008
(
or
lamellar
)
wedge.[17]|255296002

Because
the rotation|70433009
of P3
is
exacerbated|162473008|410661009
by continued pull|255238004|303370007
on the deep digital flexor tendon,|131197000|261006005|77685001|131197000|261006005|330518008|131197000|82680008|77685001|131197000|82680008|330518008
one approach|421379005
to therapy|276239002
has
been
to
cut|283396008
this tendon,|13024002|256667004
either
in the cannon region|410673009
or
in the pastern region.|78756000

While
this technique|272394005
has
been
criticized
as
being
unsuccessful|385671000
and
invasive,|10179008
its advocates
claim
that
it
is
too often|70232002
used|394850002
in cases|398241000|413769002
which
are
too far|46053002
advanced.|86005002

Advocates
claim
that
by cutting|70302008|410717008
the tendon|13024002|256667004
at the right time,|24028007|410669006
mechanical de-rotation|261018001|224046004|70433009|261018001|223637004|70433009
of P3
is
possible,|371930009|60022001
which
can
allow
time|410669006
for the new laminar attachments to|7147002|88446008|1431002
form.[18]|246176004

As an alternative
to the deep digital flexor tenotomy,|131197000|261006005|122484000|131197000|261006005|78545003|131197000|82680008|122484000|131197000|82680008|78545003
Botulinum type A toxin|419254007|261664005|404909007|261664005
has
been
infused
into the body|279495008|123037004
of the deep digital flexor muscle.|131197000|261006005|91727004|131197000|82680008|91727004

This theoretically
allows
for the same de-rotation|262126009|224046004|70433009|262126009|223637004|70433009
as the tenotomy procedure,|78545003
but
without the potential|30207005
for scarring|275322007
or
contracture|55033002
associated|47429007
with
that procedure.|71388002

A recent study|6493001|110465008|6493001|224699009
used|394850002
this technique|272394005
in seven laminitic horses.|420359007|35354009

There
was
significant improvement|386134007
in six|422218008
of the horses,|35354009
and
moderate improvement|6736007
in the seventh.[19]|86777004

Informally,
particularly
in the United States,|223688001
"founder"|44066000
has
come
to
mean|255586005
any chronic changes|90734009|243326001|90734009|263703002
in the structure
of the foot|56459004|259051005|302545001
that
can
be
linked
to laminitis.|370479001

In some texts,
the term "founder"|44066000
is
even
used synonymously|394850002
with laminitis,|370479001
though
such usage|277889008
is
technically incorrect.

Put
simply,
not
all horses|35354009
that
experience
laminitis|370479001
will
founder|44066000
but
all horses|35354009
that founder|44066000
will
first|255216001|232714002
experience
laminitis.|370479001
