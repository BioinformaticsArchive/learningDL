the absence|2667000|418560003
of a menstrual period|78456001
in a woman|224526002
of reproductive age.|424144002

Physiological states|1360005|398070004
of amenorrhoea|14302001
are
seen
during pregnancy|289908002
and
lactation|169741004|63158009
(breastfeeding|169741004
)
,
the latter also
forming|35810008
the basis|418836005
of a form|246176004
of contraception|13197004
known|36692007
as the lactational amenorrhoea method.|237122005|260686004|237122005|272394005

Outside of the reproductive years there|258707000
is
absence|2667000|418560003
of menses|248957007|282027006
during childhood|68433009
and
after menopause.|161712005

Amenorrhoea|14302001
is
a symptom
with many potential causes.|30207005|134198009

*
*Primary amenorrhoea|8913004
*
*
(menstruation|248957007
cycles
never
starting|255395001|385652002
)
may
be
caused|23981006|134198009
by developmental problems|278923009|55607006
such as the congenital absence|24216005
of the uterus,|35039007|181452004
failure|76797004
of the ovary to|15497006|83238006|181464007
receive
or
maintain|385630006
egg cells,|263828003
and
genetic diseases|429962007
such as 5-alpha-reductase deficiency|57514000
which
causes|134198009
one to|421379005
be
intersex.

Also,
delay
in pubertal development|419960003|278923009
will
lead|88488004
to primary amenorrhoea.|8913004

It
is
defined
as an absence|2667000|418560003
of secondary sexual characteristics|2603003|365952006|81170007|365952006
by age 14|424144002
with no menarche|20016009
or
normal secondary sexual characteristics|17621005|2603003|365952006|17621005|81170007|365952006|258744000|2603003|365952006|258744000|81170007|365952006
but
no menarche|20016009
by 16 years|258707000
of age.|424144002

*
*Secondary amenorrhoea|86030004
*
*
(menstruation cycles|78456001
ceasing
)
is
often|70232002
caused|23981006|134198009
by hormonal disturbances|278994005
from the hypothalamus|67923007|264483005
and
the pituitary gland,|56329008|181125003
from premature menopause|373717006
or
intrauterine scar formation.|398236008|70582006|11798007|398236008|70582006|255277001|398236008|275322007|11798007|398236008|275322007|255277001

It
is
defined
as the absence|2667000|418560003
of menses|248957007|282027006
for three months|421291004|258706009
in a woman|224526002
with previously normal menstruation|248957007|282027006
or
nine months|422113007|258706009
for women|224526002
with a history|392521001
of oligomenorrhoea.[1]|52073004

There
are
two primary ways to|420797005|63161005|420797005|261424001
classify|73504009
amenorrhoea.|14302001

Types|261664005
of amenorrhoea|14302001
are
classified|73504009
as primary|63161005|261424001
or
secondary,|2603003|81170007
or
based|418836005
on functional "compartments"|40143009|246464006
(Speroff
).

The latter classification|73504009
relates|272151006|262094002
to the hormonal state|278994005|398070004
of the patient|116154003
that
could
be
hypo-,
eu-,
or
hypergonadotropic
(meaning FSH levels|255586005|31003009
are
either
low, normal|62482003|17621005|62482003|258744000|371880002|17621005|371880002|258744000
or
high|75540009|371879000
).

Women|224526002
who
go
through significant weight loss,|386134007|89362005
dieting|41829006
,
or
perform|398166005
considerable amounts|107651007
of exercise|61686008
on a regular basis|17854005|17854005|418836005
are
at risk|410519009
of developing hypothalamic|67923007
(
or
'athletic'
)
amenorrhoea.|14302001

It
was
thought|88952004
for many years|258707000
that low body fat levels|62482003|248300009|258395000|371880002|248300009|258395000
and
exercise|61686008
related chemicals|272151006|441900009|262094002|441900009
(
such as beta endorphins|71365003
and
catecholamines|34582008
)
disrupt
the interplay
of the sex hormones estrogen|312263009|61946003
and
progesterone.|16683002

However,
recent studies|6493001|110465008|6493001|224699009
have
shown
that there
are
no differences|263735002
in the body composition,|68592003
or
hormonal levels|278994005|258395000
in amenorrhoeic athletes
as
compared to regularly cycling athletes.

Instead,
amenorrhoea|14302001
has
been
shown
to
be
directly attributable
to a low energy availability.|62482003|248272003|103328004|371880002|248272003|103328004

Many women|260396001|224526002
who diet|41829006
or
who
exercise|61686008
at a high level|75540009|258395000|75540009|276625007|371879000|258395000|371879000|276625007
do
not
take|419652001
in enough calories to|258790008
expend
on their exercise|61686008
as well as
to
maintain|385630006
their normal menstrual cycles.[6]|78456001

A second serious risk factor|81170007|42745003|80943009|257997001|42745003|80943009|288495006|42745003|80943009
of amenorrhoea|14302001
is
severe bone loss sometimes|24484000|312894000
resulting|42752001
in osteoporosis|64859006
and
osteopenia.|312894000

It
is
the third component|70905002|246093002
of an increasingly common disease|72906007|64572001
known|36692007
as female athlete triad syndrome.|248152002|5187006|224526002|5187006

The other two components|74964007|420797005|246093002
of this syndrome
are
osteoporosis|64859006
and
disordered eating.|64572001|48263008

Awareness|312012004
and
intervention|225334002
can
usually
prevent
this occurrence|272120004
in most female athletes.|248152002|224526002

Many doctors simply|260396001|309343006
prescribe
the combined oral contraceptive pill|346388008|46992007|89780004|423938009
to women|224526002
with hypothalamic amenorrhoea,|237120002
and
these women|224526002
continue|255238004
in their patterns|272135003
of
under-eating|261089000|48263008
and
over-exercising.|21481007|61686008|21481007|229065009

Often,|70232002
they
do
not
realize
that
they
have
a problem|55607006
until
they
are
trying
to
conceive
,
when
their amenorrhoea|14302001
leads|88488004|236874000
them to
seek
the treatment|276239002|416118004
of a reproductive endocrinologist.[7]|309353007

Certain medications,|17162000|410942007
particularly contraceptive medications,|417122000|410942007|348649005|410942007
can
induce|16404004
amenorrhoea|14302001
in a healthy woman.|263775005|224526002

The lack|41277001
of menstruation usually|248957007
begins|255395001
shortly
after
beginning|255395001
the medication|410942007
and
can
take up|419652001|255532002|419652001|353734004
to a year|258707000|259039008
to resume
after stopping|260890000|385654001|422117008
a medication.|410942007

Hormonal contraceptives|278994005|417122000
that
contain|42504009
only progestogen|50607009|20249007|420295001|20249007
like the oral contraceptive Micronor,|423938009|5935008
and
especially higher-dose formulations|261829003
like the injectable Depo Provera commonly|385218009|126112002|129326001|126112002
induce|16404004
this side-effect.

Extended cycle use|255536004|44180009|277889008|255536004|44180009|419385000|288467006|44180009|277889008|288467006|44180009|419385000|255590007|44180009|277889008|255590007|44180009|419385000
of combined hormonal contraceptives also|89780004|278994005|417122000
allow
suppression|80633008|258761002
of menstruation.|248957007

The use|277889008|419385000
of opiates|5602001|360204007
(
such as heroin|387341002
)
on a regular basis|17854005|17854005|418836005
has
also
been
known|36692007
to
cause|23981006|134198009
amenorrhoea|14302001
in longer term users.

Treatments|276239002
vary
based|418836005
on the underlying condition.|260905004

Key issues|55607006
are
problems|55607006
of surgical correction|83578000
if
appropriate
and
oestrogen therapy|61946003|276239002
if
oestrogen levels|61946003|258395000
are
low.|62482003|371880002

For those
who
do
not
plan|52713000|397943006
to
have
biological children,|75226009
treatment|276239002|416118004
may
be
unnecessary
if
the underlying cause|134198009
of the amenorrhoea|14302001
is
not threatening
to their health.|263775005

Unless
receiving eggs|102263004
from an egg donor|430882007
or
_
in vitro_ fertilization,|55767001
a woman|224526002
is
unable to|371151008
conceive
while
she
is
amenorrhoeic.

On the other hand,|74964007|85562004|74964007|302539009
'athletic'
and
drug-induced amenorrhoea|278993004|14302001
has
no effect|253861007
on long term fertility|397594008|8619003|87727006
as long|255511005
as menstruation|248957007
can
recommence.

The best way to
treat|395077000
'athletic' amenorrhoea|14302001
is
to
decrease|260400001|260370003
the amount|107651007
and
intensity|103370009
of exercise.|61686008

Similarly,
to
treat|395077000
drug-induced amenorrhoea,|278993004|14302001
stopping|260890000|385654001|422117008
the medication|410942007
on the advice|420227002
of a doctor|309343006
is
a usual course|288524001
of action.|129264002

The term
is
derived
from Greek|1451003
:
_
a_
= negative,|260385009
_men_|339947000
= month,|258706009|259036001
_rhoia_
= flow.

Derived adjectives
are
*
*amenorrhoeal|14302001
*
*
and
*
*amenorrhoeic
*
*.

The opposite
is
the normal menstrual period|282027006|248957007|248957007|17621005|78456001|258744000|78456001
(eumenorrhoea
).

In preindustrial societies,
menarche typically|20016009
occurred|272120004
later|260383002
than
in current industrial societies.|15240007

After menarche,|20016009
menstruation|248957007
was
suppressed|245780008
during much|242762006|4757001
of a woman's reproductive life|224526002|224130005
by
either
pregnancy|289908002
or
nursing.|169741004|265937000

Reductions|58294000|289928003
in age|424144002
of menarche|20016009
and
lower fertility rates|261122009|397594008|261122009|8619003|261122009|87727006
mean|255586005
that modern women|224526002
menstruate
far more often|46053002|70232002
than they
did
under the conditions|260905004
prevalent
for most
of human evolutionary history.[8]|278412004|278412004|392521001
