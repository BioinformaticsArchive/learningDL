Candidiasis|78048006
encompasses
infections
that range
from superficial,|26283006
such as oral thrush|79740000
and
vaginitis,|30800001|237091009
to systemic|31099001
and
potentially life-threatening diseases.|224130005|64572001

_Candida_ infections|78048006
of the latter category
are
also
referred|439980006
to
as
candidemia|432261003
and
are
usually
confined
to severely immunocompromised persons,|24484000|370391006|125676002
such as cancer,|363346000|372087000

and
AIDS patients,|62479008|116154003
as well as
nontrauma emergency surgery patients.[4]|25876001|83578000|116154003

Superficial infections|26283006
of skin|119325001|39937001|181469002
and
mucosal membranes|313268005|83097008
by _Candida_ causing local inflammation|3265006|23981006|255470001|257552002
and
discomfort|367391008|87128005
are
common|72906007
in many human populations.|278412004|385436007

While
clearly attributable
to the presence|386397008
of the opportunistic pathogens|264418008
of the genus _Candida_,|3265006
candidiasis|78048006
describes
a number|410680006|410681005
of different disease syndromes|263735002|64572001
that often|70232002
differ
in their causes|134198009
and
outcomes.[2][5]|394617004

Candidiasis|78048006
may
be
divided|422033008
into the following types|255260001|261664005
:
[3]|260313008

Symptoms
of candidiasis|78048006
vary
depending
on the area|42798000
affected.|247591002|248448006

Most candidial infections|4757001
result|394617004
in minimal complications|255605001|116223007|255604002|116223007
such as redness,|386713009|371240000
itching|424492005
and
discomfort,|367391008|87128005
though
complications|116223007
may
be
severe|24484000
or
fatal|399166001
if
left|7771000
untreated|25265005
in certain populations.|17162000|385436007

In immunocompetent persons,|35194002|125676002
candidiasis|78048006
is
usually
a very localized infection|260358002|10443009
of the skin|119325001|39937001|181469002

a very common cause|260358002|72906007|134198009
of vaginal irritation,|161816004
or
vaginitis,|30800001|237091009

can
also
occur|272120004
on the male genitals.|276179002

In immunocompromised patients,|370391006
_Candida_ infections|78048006
can
affect|4065008
the esophagus|32849002|181245004
with the potential|30207005
of
becoming
systemic,|31099001
causing|23981006
a much more serious condition,|242762006|42745003|260905004|4757001|42745003|260905004

Descriptions
of what
sounds
like oral thrush|79740000
go
back
to the time|410669006
of Hippocrates _circa_ 460 - 370 BC.[7]

The genus _Candida_|3265006
and
species _C.|69658003

albicans_
were
described
by botanist Christine Marie Berkhout|5334003
in her doctoral thesis|309343006
at the University|224871002
of Utrecht
in 1923.

Over the years,|258707000
the classification|73504009
of the genera|18511007
and
species|69658003
has
evolved.|59381007

Obsolete names|41228009
for this genus|18511007
include|55919000
_Mycotorula_
and
_Torulopsis_.|3265006

The species|69658003
has
also
been
known|36692007
in the past|410513005
as
_Monilia albicans_|20849004
and
_Oidium albicans_.|20849004

The current classification|15240007|73504009
is
_nomen conservandum_,
which means|255586005
the name
is
authorized
for use|277889008|419385000
by the International Botanical Congress (IBC).[27]

The genus _Candida_|3265006
includes|55919000
about 150 different species|263735002|69658003
;
however,
only
a few
are
known|36692007
to
cause|23981006|134198009
human infections.|278412004

_C.

albicans_
is
the most significant pathogenic species.|371925005|264418008|69658003

Other species|74964007|69658003
pathogenic|264418008
in humans|278412004
include|55919000
_C.

tropicalis_,
_C.

glabrata_,
_C.

krusei_,
_C.

parapsilosis_,
_C.

dubliniensis_,
and
_C.

lusitaniae_.

Some alternative medicine proponents|350084001
postulate
a widespread occurrence|85333001|272120004
of systemic candidiasis|70572005
(
or
candida hypersensitivity syndrome,|3265006|421961002|3265006|421369008
yeast allergy,|58296003|408439002|58296003|421961002|412534006|408439002|412534006|421961002|411818003|408439002|411818003|421961002
or
gastrointestinal candida overgrowth|84679006
)
,
a medically unrecognised condition.|260905004

The view|246516004
was
most widely|4757001
promoted
in a book|278212002
published
by Dr.|309343006

William Crook[29]
that
hypothesized
a variety
of common symptoms|72906007
such as fatigue,|84229001
PMS,
sexual dysfunction,|56627002|231532002
asthma,|195967001
psoriasis,|9014002
digestive|106079008|86762007
and
urinary problems,|55607006
multiple sclerosis,|24700007
and
muscle pain|68962001
could
be
caused|23981006|134198009
by subclinical infections|28456004
of _C.

albicans_.

Crook
suggested
a variety
of remedies to
treat|395077000
these symptoms,
including|55919000
dietary modification|41829006|243326001
(commonly
referred|439980006
to
as
the _rainbow diet_|41829006
-
-
eating|48263008
fresh foods|228022004
and
avoiding foods|255620007
high|75540009|371879000
in vinegar,|227565008
sugar,|2331003|74801000
or
yeast|58296003|412534006|411818003
)
,
prescription antifungals,|260885003|373219008
pau d'arco tea,|16313001
echinacea tea,|412179000|16313001
and
colonic irrigation.|174228003

With the exception
of the few dietary studies|57176003|41829006|110465008|57176003|41829006|224699009
in the urinary tract infection section,|68566005|62083003|68566005|118630004
conventional medicine|255333006|410942007
has
not
used|394850002
most
of these alternatives,
since
limited scientific evidence proves|255469002|18669006|277025001
either
their effectiveness|255403003
or
subclinical systemic candidiasis|74314007|70572005
is
a viable diagnosis.[30][31][32][33]|263927007|439401001|264664006|264667004|263927007|264664006|264667004

In 1990,
alternative health vendor _Nature's Way_|263775005|277302009
signed|72670004
an FTC consent agreement|255028004|404856006
not to
misrepresent
in advertising
any self-diagnostic test concerning yeast conditions|103693007|58296003|260905004|103693007|412534006|260905004|103693007|411818003|260905004
or
to
make
any unsubstantiated representation
concerning
any food|255620007
or
supplement's ability to|373453009|371150009
control|31509003
yeast conditions,|58296003|260905004|412534006|260905004|411818003|260905004
with a fine|3082000
of $30,000 payable
to the National Institutes of Health|385437003|263775005
for research
in genuine candidiasis.[28]|78048006
