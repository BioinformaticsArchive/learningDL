*Migraine|37796009
*
*
is
a chronic disorder|27624003
characterized
by recurrent moderate|255227004|6736007
to severe headaches often|24484000|25064002|70232002
in association|263534001|272151006
with a number|410680006|410681005
of autonomic nervous system symptoms.|72167002|72167002|267070008

The word|255373000
derives
from the Greek ?????????|1451003
(_hemikrania_
)
,
"pain|22253000
on one side|66459002
of the head",|69536005|302548004
[1]|260305007
from ???-
(_hemi-_|363665002
)
,
"half",
and ???????
(_kranion_
)
,
"skull".[2]|89546000

Typically
the headache|25064002
is
unilateral|66459002
(affecting one half|247591002|421379005|248448006|421379005
of the head|69536005|302548004
)
and
pulsating|255356002
in nature,|277302009
lasting
from 2|260306008
to 72 hours.|123028004

Associated symptoms|102483000
may
include|55919000
nausea,|422587007
vomiting|249497008
,
photophobia|409668002
(increased sensitivity|35105006|35209006|35105006|365705006|260366006|35209006|260366006|365705006
to light|56242006|371268001
)
,
phonophobia|313387002
(increased sensitivity|35105006|35209006|35105006|365705006|260366006|35209006|260366006|365705006
to sound|68325009
)
and
the pain|22253000
is
generally
aggravated|162473008|410661009
by physical activity.|48761009

Up to one-third|421379005|70905002
of people|125676002
with migraine headaches|37796009
perceive|81742003
an aura|18618006
:
a transient visual, sensory, language,|14803004|255374006|262139008|61909002
or
motor disturbance
which
signals|38952000
that
the headache|25064002
will
soon
occur.|272120004

Occasionally
an aura|18618006
can
occur|272120004
with little|281411007|255507004
or
no headache|25064002
following|255260001
it.

Migraines|37796009
are
believed
to
be
due to a mixture|272163001
of environmental|276339004
and
genetic factors.|3950001|255395001

About two-thirds|420797005|70905002
of cases run in families.|398241000|418060005|35359004|398241000|282476009|35359004|413769002|418060005|35359004|413769002|282476009|35359004

Fluctuating hormone levels|255341006|365774006
may
also
play|300776002
a role
:
migraine|37796009
affects|4065008
slightly more boys|425404009|433152004
than girls|431549007
before puberty,|18991001
but
about
two|420797005
to three times more women|421291004|410669006|224526002|421291004|417929005|224526002
than men.|339947000

Propensity
for migraines usually|37796009
decreases|260370003
during pregnancy.|289908002

The exact mechanisms|257544000
of migraine|37796009
are
not
known.|36692007

It
is
,
however,
believed
to
be
a neurovascular disorder.|64572001

The primary theory|63161005|261424001
is
related|272151006|262094002
to increased excitability|35105006|102893002|260366006|102893002
of the cerebral cortex|40146001
and
abnormal control|263654008|31509003
of pain neurons|22253000|47220008
in the trigeminal nucleus|280164007
of the brainstem.[8]|15926001|180925009

Initial recommended management|884001|413454004|884001|119270007|232714002|413454004|232714002|119270007
is
with simple analgesics|13673007|373265006
such as ibuprofen|387207008
and
acetaminophen|387517004
for the headache,|25064002
an antiemetic|372764000
for the nausea,|422587007
and
the avoidance
of triggers.

Specific agents|69658003|260872001
such as triptans
or
ergotamines|395975005
may
be
used|394850002
by those for whom simple analgesics|86495002|13673007|373265006|416930009|13673007|373265006
are
not effective.|255403003|254648000

Globally,
more
than 10%
of the population|385436007|389109008
is
affected|247591002|248448006
by migraine|37796009
at some point
in life.|52101004|224130005|18720000|224130005

Migraines typically|37796009
present|52101004|246105001
with self-limited, recurrent severe headache|255469002|255227004|24484000|25064002
associated|47429007
with autonomic symptoms.|72167002

About 15-30%
of people|125676002
with migraines|37796009
experience
migraines|37796009
with an aura[10][11]|18618006
and
those who
have
migraines|37796009
with aura also frequently|18618006|70232002
have
migraines|37796009
without aura.|18618006

The severity|272141005
of the pain,|22253000
duration|103335007
of the headache,|25064002
and
frequency|260864003|272123002
of attacks|216299002
is
variable.|255372005

A migraine lasting|37796009
longer|255511005
than 72 hours|123028004
is
termed status migrainosus.|230467008

There
are
four possible phases|421534005|371930009|272108007|421534005|60022001|272108007
to a migraine,|37796009
although
not
all the phases|272108007
are
necessarily
experienced
:
[3]|260313008

Prodromal
or
premonitory symptoms|83931009
occur|272120004
in ~60%
of those with migraines[14][15]|20401003|37796009|421463005|37796009
with an onset|77374008
of two hours|420797005|258702006
to two days|420797005|258703001
before the start|255395001
of pain|22253000
or
the aura [16]|18618006
These symptoms
may
include|55919000
a wide variety|90522003
of phenomena[17]
including|55919000
:
altered mood,|18963009
irritability,|55929007
depression|35489007|366979004|255339005
or
euphoria,|307074005
fatigue,|84229001
craving
for certain food,|17162000|255620007
stiff muscles|91727004
(especially
in the neck|45048000|302550007
)
,
constipation|14760008
or
diarrhea,|398032003
and
sensitivity|35209006|365705006
to smells|397686008
or
noise.

This
may
occur|272120004
in those with|20401003|421463005
either
migraine|37796009
with aura|18618006
or
migraine|37796009
without aura.[18]|18618006

An aura|18618006
is
a transient focal neurological phenomenon|14803004|87017008|1199008
that
occurs|272120004
before|236874000|421718005
or
during the headache.|25064002

They
appear
gradually
over a number|410680006|410681005
of minutes|258701004|255507004|356624006
and
generally
last
fewer|57176003
than 60 minutes.|258701004|255507004|356624006

Symptoms
can
be
visual, sensory|255374006|262139008
or
motor
in nature|277302009
and
many people|260396001|125676002
experience
more
than one.|421379005

Visual effects|255374006|253861007
are
the most common,|4757001|72906007
occurring|272120004
in
up to 99%
of cases|398241000|413769002
and
exclusively
in more|242762006
than half.

Vision disturbances often|397540003|70232002
consist
of a scintillating scotoma|2228002
(
an area|42798000
of partial alteration|255609007
in the field|52101004|255798002|18720000|255798002
of vision|281004000
which flickers.|56170001
)
[15]
These typically
start|255395001
near the center|26216008
of vision|281004000
and
then
spread out|410677005
to the sides|182353008
with zigzagging lines|110604002
which
have
been
described
to
look|386548000
like fortifications
or
walls|224727009
of a castle.|224641008

Usually
the lines|50009006
are
in black and white|315240009|413773004|315240009|185984009|315240009|371251000|413464008|413773004|413464008|185984009|413464008|371251000|15086000|413773004|15086000|185984009|15086000|371251000|371252007|413773004|371252007|185984009|371252007|371251000
but
some people also|125676002
see|281004000
colored lines.|103366001|50009006

Some people|125676002
lose
part|260726005
of their field|255798002
of vision|281004000
known|36692007
as hemianopsia|77674003
while
others|74964007
experience
blurring.[20]|246636008

Sensory aura|262139008|18618006
are
the second most common|81170007|72906007|257997001|72906007|288495006|72906007
occurring|272120004
in 30-40%|259031006
of people|125676002
with auras.|18618006

Often|70232002
a feeling|285854004
of pins-|77444004
and-
needles|79068005
begins|255395001
on one side|66459002
in the hand|85562004|302539009
and
arm|40983000|53120007|182245002|302538001
and
spreads|410677005
to the nose-mouth area|260540009|74262004|42798000|260540009|123851003|42798000|260540009|21082005|42798000|260540009|181220002|42798000|181195007|74262004|42798000|181195007|123851003|42798000|181195007|21082005|42798000|181195007|181220002|42798000
on the same side.|262126009|182353008

Numbness|398026008|44077006
usually
occurs|272120004
after the tingling|162249002
has
passed
with a loss
of position sense.|73535003

Other symptoms|74964007
of the aura phase|18618006|21191007
can
include|55919000
:
speech
or
language disturbances,|61909002
world spinning,
and
less commonly motor problems.|276139006|55607006|263796003|55607006

Motor symptoms|267082004
indicate|410535002
that
this
is
a hemiplegic migraine,|59292006
and
weakness often|13791008|70232002|70232002|260407003|70232002
lasts
longer|255511005
than one hour|421379005|258702006|421379005|286551008
unlike other auras.|74964007|18618006

An aura rarely|18618006|103356009
occurs|272120004
without a subsequent headache,|255260001|25064002
[20]
known|36692007
as a silent migraine.|263872000|37796009

Classically
the headache|25064002
is
unilateral,|66459002
throbbing|410704005
,
and
moderate|6736007
to severe|24484000
in intensity.|103370009

It usually
comes
on gradually[19]
and
is
aggravated|162473008|410661009
by physical activity.|48761009

In more|242762006
than 40%|259031006
of cases however|398241000|413769002
the pain|22253000
may
be
bilateral,|51440002
and
neck pain|81680005
is
commonly
associated.|47429007

Bilateral pain|51440002|22253000
is
particularly common|72906007
in those
who
have
migraines|37796009
without an aura.|18618006

Less commonly pain|276139006|22253000|263796003|22253000
may
occur|272120004
primarily
in the back|123961009|255551008|281213008|302552004|77568009
or
top|421812003
of the head.|69536005|302548004

The pain usually|22253000
lasts
4
to 72 hours|123028004
in adults[19] however|133936004
in young children frequently|84422007|410601007|70232002|84422007|160499008|70232002
lasts
less
than 1 hour.|260305007|258702006|260305007|286551008

The frequency|260864003|272123002
of attacks|216299002
is
variable,|255372005
from a few|57176003
in a lifetime
to several|261028005
a week,|258705008|259038000
with the average
being
about
one|421379005
a month.[23][24]|258706009|264657009|259036001|264657009

The pain|22253000
is
frequently|70232002
accompanied
by nausea,|422587007
vomiting|249497008
,
sensitivity|35209006|365705006
to light,|56242006|371268001
sensitivity|35209006|365705006
to sound,|68325009
sensitivity|35209006|365705006
to smells,|397686008
fatigue|84229001
and
irritability.|55929007

In a basilar migraine,|83351003
a migraine|37796009
with neurological symptoms|267070008
related|272151006|262094002
to the brain stem|15926001|180925009
or
with neurological symptoms|267070008
on
both
sides|182353008
of the body,|279495008|123037004
[25] common effects|72906007|253861007
include|55919000
:
a sense|106148006
of the world spinning,
light-headedness,|386705008
and
confusion.|286933003

Nausea|422587007
occurs|272120004
in almost 90%|264705001|264703008
of people,|125676002
and
vomiting|249497008
occurs|272120004
in about one-third.|421379005|70905002

Many thus
seek
a dark|255419005
and
quiet room.|255357006

Other symptoms|74964007
may
include|55919000
:
blurred vision,|246636008
nasal stuffiness,|68235000
diarrhea,|398032003
frequent urination,|162116003
pallor,|398979000
or
sweating.|161857006

Swelling|423666004|442672001
or
tenderness|247348008
of the scalp|41695006|181480002
may
occur|272120004
as
can
neck stiffness.|161882006

Associated symptoms|102483000
are
less common|276139006|72906007|263796003|72906007
in the elderly.[28]|105436006

The effects|253861007
of migraine|37796009
may
persist
for some days|258703001
after the main headache|63161005|25064002
has
ended|385656004|422117008
;
this
is
called
the migraine postdrome.|37796009

Many
report|229059009|223458004
a sore feeling|247348008|285854004|247348008|279074008|285854004|279074008|410713007|285854004|410713007
in the area|42798000
where the migraine|37796009
was
,
and
some
report|229059009|223458004
impaired thinking|260379002|88952004|40226000|88952004
for a few days|57176003|258703001
after the headache|25064002
has
passed.

The patient|116154003
may
feel|285854004
tired|224960004
or
"hung
over"
and
have
head pain,|25064002
cognitive difficulties,|371157007
gastrointestinal symptoms,|267045008
mood changes,|18963009
and
weakness.|13791008|260407003

According to one summary,|421379005
"
Some people|125676002
feel|285854004
unusually
refreshed
or
euphoric|307074005
after an attack,|217315002|216299002
whereas
others|74964007
note
depression|35489007|366979004|255339005
and
malaise."[30]|367391008

The underlying cause|134198009
of migraines|37796009
is
unknown|261665006
[31] however|264664006
they
are
believed
to
be
related|272151006|262094002
to a mix|26242008|421826007
of environmental|276339004
and
genetic factors.|3950001|255395001

They run in families|418060005|35359004|282476009|35359004
in about two-thirds|420797005|70905002
of cases[5]|398241000|413769002
and
rarely|103356009
occur|272120004
due to a single gene defect.|264572004

A number|410680006|410681005
of psychological conditions|60224009|260905004
are
associated|47429007
including|55919000
:
depression,|35489007|366979004|255339005
anxiety,|48694002|197480006
and
bipolar disorder[33]|13746004|264667004
as
are
many biological events|260396001|12893009|272379006
or
triggers.

Studies|110465008|224699009
of twins|11286003
indicate|410535002
a 34
to 51% genetic influence|3950001|255395001
of likelihood to|2931005
develop
migraine headaches.|37796009

This genetic relationship|3950001|272151006|255395001|272151006
is
stronger|260404005
for migraines|37796009
with aura|18618006
than
for migraines|37796009
without aura.|18618006

A number|410680006|410681005
of specific variants|69658003|40885006
of genes|67271001
increase|260366006
the risk|30207005
by a small to|255507004
moderate|6736007
amount.[34]|107651007

Single gene disorders|125681006|67271001|64572001|50607009|67271001|64572001
that
result|394617004
in migraines|37796009
are
rare.|84638005|103356009

One|421379005
of these
is
known|36692007
as familial hemiplegic migraine,|95656000
a type|261664005
of migraine|37796009
with aura,|18618006
which
is
inherited|255404009
in an autosomal dominant fashion.|263681008

The disorders|64572001
are
related|272151006|262094002
to variants|40885006
of gene coding|67271001
for proteins|88878007
involved|248448006
in ion transport.|48006008|57188001|48006008|360300001

Another genetic disorder causing migraine|32895009|23981006|37796009
is
CADASIL syndrome|390936003
or
cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy|263681008|359557001
with subcortical infarcts|55641003
and
leukoencephalopathy.[15]|22811006

Migraines|37796009
may
be
induced|16404004
by triggers,
with some
reporting|223458004
it
as
an influence
in a minority|410599005|255606000
of cases[5]|398241000|413769002
and
others|74964007
the majority.

Many things|260396001
have
been
labeled
as triggers,
however
the strength|260404005
and
significance|386134007
of these relationships|272151006
are
uncertain.|64957009

A trigger|410658008
may
occur|272120004
up to 24 hours|123027009|259029002
prior to the onset|77374008
of symptoms.[5]

Common triggers|72906007
quoted
are
stress,|262188008
hunger,|55350005
and
fatigue|84229001
(
these equally
contribute
to tension headaches.|66551002

Migraines|37796009
are
more likely to|242762006|2931005
occur|272120004
around menstruation.|248957007

Other hormonal influences,|74964007|278994005
such as menarche,|20016009
oral contraceptive use,|26643006|417122000|26643006|348649005|423938009|277889008|423938009|419385000|5935008|277889008|5935008|419385000
pregnancy,|289908002
perimenopause,
and
menopause,|161712005
also
play|300776002
a role.

These hormonal influences|278994005
seem
to
play|300776002
a greater role|263768009
in migraine|37796009
without aura.|18618006

Migraines typically|37796009
do
not
occur|272120004
during the second|81170007|257997001|288495006
and
third trimesters|255248002
or
following|255260001
menopause.[15]|161712005

Reviews
of dietary triggers|41829006
have
found|404684003
that evidence mostly|18669006
relies
on subjective assessments|255362007|386053000
and
is
not rigorous enough to|16046003|248457000
prove|277025001
or
disprove
any particular triggers.

Regarding
specific agents there|69658003|260872001
does
not
appear
to
be
evidence|18669006
for an effect|253861007
of tyramine|14092002
on migraine[44]|37796009
and
while
monosodium glutamate (MSG)|75665004
is
frequently|70232002
reported|229059009|223458004
as a dietary trigger[45] evidence|41829006|18669006|41829006|410658008|18669006
does
not consistently
support|9096001|243114000
this.[46]

Potential triggers|30207005
in the indoor
and
outdoor environment|276339004
concluded
the overall evidence|18669006
was
of poor quality,|11403006|263496004|255351007|263496004
but
nevertheless suggested people|125676002
with migraines|37796009
take|419652001
some preventive measures|262073000|246445000|262073000|367346004|129428001|246445000|129428001|367346004

true.[41]|31874001

Migraines|37796009
are
believed
to
be
a neurovascular disorder[5]|64572001
with evidence supporting|18669006|9096001|18669006|243114000
its mechanisms|257544000
starting|255395001|385652002
within the brain|12738006|258335003
and
then
spreading|410677005
to the blood vessels.|59820001

Some researchers
feel|285854004
neuronal mechanisms|47220008|257544000
play|300776002
a greater role,|263768009
[49]
while
others|74964007
feel|285854004
blood vessels|59820001
play|300776002
the key role.

There
are
a number|410680006|410681005
of explanations
for its occurrence|272120004

the blood flow|58190003
to the cerebral cortex|40146001
in the area|42798000

triggered.[52]|410658008

The exact mechanism|257544000
of the head pain|25064002
which
occurs|272120004
during a migraine|37796009
is
unknown.|261665006

Some evidence|18669006
supports|9096001|243114000
a primary role|63161005|261424001
for central nervous system structures|21483005
(
such as the brainstem|15926001|180925009
and
diencephalon[54]|87563008|279328001
while
other data|74964007
support|9096001|243114000
the role peripheral activation|14414005
(
such as
via the sensory nerves|262139008|3057000

The potential candidates vessels|30207005|59820001
include|55919000
:
dural arteries,|18545000|51114001|18545000|11527006

such as those
of the scalp.|41695006|181480002

The role
of vasodilatation|91081006
of the extracranial arteries,|303232006|51114001|303232006|11527006

The diagnosis|439401001
of a migraine|37796009
is
based|418836005
on signs|72670004

Migraines|37796009
were
first comprehensively|255216001|232714002
classified|73504009
in 1988.

The International Headache Society most recently|25064002|6493001
updated
their classification|73504009
of headaches|25064002
in 2004.

According to this classification migraines|73504009|37796009
are
primary headaches|63161005|25064002|261424001|25064002
along
with tension-type headaches|66551002
and
cluster headaches,|193031009
among others.[57]|74964007

Migraines|37796009

The diagnosis|439401001
of abdominal migraines|75879005
is
controversial.

Some evidence|18669006
indicates|410535002
that recurrent episodes|263853000
of abdominal pain|21522001
in the absence|2667000|418560003
of a headache|25064002
may
be
a type|261664005
of migraine.|37796009

Or
are
at least
a precursor
to migraines.|37796009

These episodes|272128006
of pain|22253000
may
or
may
not
follow|367409002|421939007
a migraine|37796009
like prodrome|83931009
and
typically last minutes|258701004|255507004|356624006
to hours.|258702006

occur|272120004
in those with|20401003|421463005
either
a personal
or
family history|57177007

Other syndromes|74964007
that
are
believed
to
be
precursors
include|55919000
:
cyclical vomiting syndrome|18773000

surgery.|83578000

Prevention|169443000
is
recommended
in those
who
have
headaches more|25064002
than two days|420797005|258703001
a week,|258705008|259038000
cannot
tolerate
the medications|410942007
used|394850002
to
treat|395077000
acute attacks,|272118002|216299002
or
those
with severe attacks|24484000|216299002
that
are
not easily|36203004
controlled.[11]|31509003

The goal|410518001
is
to
reduce|260400001
the frequency,|260864003|272123002
painfulness,|22253000
and/or
duration|103335007
of migraines,|37796009
and
to
increase|260366006
the effectiveness|255403003
of abortive therapy.|276239002

Another reason prevention|410666004|169443000
is
to
avoid
medication overuse headache.|410942007|25064002

This
is
a common problem|72906007|55607006
and
can
result|394617004
in chronic daily headache.[62][63]|90734009|69620002|25064002

Preventive migraine medications|262073000|37796009|410942007|129428001|37796009|410942007
are
considered
effective|255403003|254648000
if
they
reduce|260400001
the frequency|260864003|272123002
or
severity|272141005
of the migraine|37796009
attacks|216299002
by
at least 50%.|276139006|263796003

Guidelines
are
fairly consistent|385433004
in rating topiramate,|386844006
divalproex/sodium valproate,|5641004|372812003|387080000|387481005
propranolol,|372772003
and
metoprolol|372826007
as
having
the highest level|75540009|258395000|75540009|276625007|371879000|258395000|371879000|276625007
of evidence|18669006
for first-line use.|255216001|50009006|277889008|255216001|50009006|419385000|232714002|50009006|277889008|232714002|50009006|419385000

Recommendations
regarding
effectiveness|255403003
varied
however
for gabapentin.|386845007

Timolol|372880004
is
also effective|255403003|254648000
for migraine prevention|37796009|169443000
and
in reducing migraine attack frequency|260400001|37796009|217315002|260864003|260400001|37796009|217315002|272123002|260400001|37796009|216299002|260864003|260400001|37796009|216299002|272123002
and
severity,|272141005
while
frovatriptan|411990007
is
effective|255403003|254648000
for prevention|169443000
of menstrual migraine.|23186000

Amitriptyline|372726002
and
venlafaxine|372490001
are
probably also effective.|255403003|254648000

Botox|404909007
has
been
found|404684003
to
be
useful
in those with chronic migraines|20401003|90734009|37796009|421463005|90734009|37796009
but
not
those
with episodic ones.[67]|278499009|421379005

Acupuncture|44868003
is
effective|255403003|254648000
in the treatment|276239002|416118004
of migraines.|37796009

The use|277889008|419385000
of "true" acupuncture|31874001|44868003
is
not more efficient|260375008
than sham acupuncture,|44868003
however,
both
"true"|31874001
and
sham acupuncture|44868003
appear
more effective|242762006|255403003|242762006|254648000
than routine care,|50811001
with fewer adverse effects|57176003
than prophylactic drug treatment.|169443000|410942007

Chiropractic manipulation,|46947000
physiotherapy,|91251008
massage|387854002
and
relaxation
might
be
as
effective|255403003|254648000
as propranolol|372772003
or
topiramate|386844006
in the prevention|169443000
of migraine headaches|37796009
;
however,
the research
had
some problems|55607006
with methodology.

There
is
some tentative evidence|18669006
of benefit
for
:
magnesium,|72717003
coenzyme Q(10|412129003
)
,
riboflavin,|13235001
vitamin B(12|419382002
)
,
[72]
and
Fever-|386661006
few,
although
better quality trials|3442003|263496004|110465008
must
be
done
to
confirm|59156000
these preliminary results.|261420005|394617004

Of the alternative medicines|350084001
butterbur|417382006
has
the best evidence|18669006
for its use.[74]|277889008|419385000

Medical devices,|303607000
such as biofeedback|28150003|61334006
and
neurostimulators,|25937001
have
some advantages
in migraine prevention,|37796009|169443000
mainly
when
common anti-migraine medications|56097005|410942007
are
contraindicated|410536001
or
in case|398241000
of medication overuse.|410942007

Biofeedback|28150003|61334006
helps
people|125676002
be
conscious
of some physiological parameters so|1360005|252116004
as to control|31509003
them
and
try
to relax|15166001
and
may
be
efficient|260375008
for migraine treatment.|37796009|276239002|37796009|416118004

Neurostimulation|78746004
uses|277889008|394850002|260676000|419385000
implantable neurostimulators|40388003|25937001
similar
to pacemakers|14106009
for the treatment|276239002|416118004
of intractable chronic migraines|423894005|90734009
with encouraging results|394617004
for severe cases.|24484000|398241000|24484000|413769002

Migraine surgery,|37796009|83578000
which
involves|248448006
decompression|19484001|424128006|281613004
of certain nerves|17162000|3057000
around the head|69536005|302548004
and
neck,|45048000|302550007
may
be
an option
in certain people|17162000|125676002
who
do
not
improve|385425000|3442003|385633008
with medications.[79]|410942007

There
are
three main aspects|421291004|63161005
of treatment|276239002|416118004
:
trigger avoidance,|410658008
acute symptomatic control,|272118002|264931009|31509003
and
pharmacological prevention.|56183000|169443000

Medications|410942007
are
more effective|242762006|255403003|242762006|254648000
if
used|394850002
earlier|264499004
in an attack.|217315002|216299002

The frequent use|70232002|277889008|70232002|419385000
of medications|410942007
may
result|394617004
in medication overuse headache,|410942007|25064002
in which
the headaches|25064002
become
more severe|242762006|24484000
and
more frequent.|242762006|70232002

This
may
occur|272120004
with triptans,
ergotamines,|395975005
and
analgesics,|373265006
especially narcotic analgesics.[3]

Recommended initial treatment|884001|276239002|884001|416118004|232714002|276239002|232714002|416118004
for those with mild to moderate symptoms|20401003|371923003|421463005|371923003
are
simple analgesics|13673007|373265006
such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)|372665008
or
the combination|89780004
of acetaminophen,|387517004
acetylsalicylic acid,|387458008
and
caffeine.|255641001

A number|410680006|410681005
of NSAIDs|372665008
have
evidence to|18669006
support|9096001|243114000
their use.|277889008|419385000

Ibuprofen|387207008
has
been
found|404684003
to
provide
effective pain relief|255403003|182970005|254648000|182970005
in about half
of people[80]|125676002
and
diclofenac|7034005
has
been
found effective.[81]|404684003|255403003|404684003|254648000|255403003|254648000

Aspirin|387458008
can
relieve|397855004
moderate|6736007
to severe migraine pain,|76948002|37796009
with an effectiveness|255403003
similar
to sumatriptan.|395892000

Ketorolac|372501008
is
available|103328004
in an intravenous formulation.|255560000

Paracetamol|387517004
(also
known|36692007
as acetaminophen|387517004
)
,
either
alone|105529008
or
in combination|89780004
with metoclopramide,|372776000
is
another effective treatment|255403003|276239002|255403003|416118004|254648000|276239002|254648000|416118004
with a low risk|62482003|30207005|371880002|30207005
of adverse effects.

In pregnancy acetaminophen|289908002|387517004
and
metoclopramide|372776000
are
deemed
safe
as
are
NSAIDs|372665008
until the third trimester.[11]|255248002

Triptans
such as sumatriptan|395892000
are
effective|255403003|254648000
for
both
pain|22253000
and
nausea|422587007
in
up to 75%
of people.|125676002

They
are
the initially recommended treatments|884001|276239002
for those with moderate|20401003|6736007|421463005|6736007
to severe pain|76948002
or
those
with milder symptoms|162468002
who
do
not
respond
to simple analgesics.|13673007|373265006

The different forms|263735002|246176004
available|103328004
include|55919000
oral, injectable, nasal spray,|260548002|385218009|385157007|260548002|129326001|385157007
and
oral dissolving tablets.|421026006|421682005

In general,|60132005
all the triptans
appear
equally effective,|255403003|254648000
with similar side effects.

However,
individuals|125676002|385435006
may
respond
better|3442003
to specific ones.|69658003|421379005

Most side effects
are
mild,|255604002
such as flushing|271811009
;
however,
rare cases|84638005|398241000|84638005|413769002|103356009|398241000|103356009|413769002
of myocardial ischemia|53741008|414795007
have
occurred.|272120004

They
are
thus
not
recommended
for people|125676002
with cardiovascular disease.|49601007

While
historically
not
recommended
in those with basilar migraines there|20401003|83351003|421463005|83351003
is
no specific evidence|69658003|18669006
of harm
from their use|277889008|419385000
in this population to|385436007|389109008
support|9096001|243114000
this caution.

They
are
not addictive,
but
may
cause|23981006|134198009
medication overuse headaches|410942007|25064002
if
used|394850002
more
than 10 days|258703001
per month.[85]|258706009|259036001

Ergotamine|395975005
and
dihydroergotamine|387267005
are
older medications still|70753007|410942007
prescribed
for migraines,|37796009
the latter
in nasal spray|385157007
and
injectable forms.|385218009|246176004|129326001|246176004

They
appear
equally effective|255403003|254648000
to the triptans,
[86]
are
less expensive,[87]|276139006|263796003
and
experience
adverse effects
that typically
are
benign.|30807003

In the most debilitating cases,|4757001|398241000|4757001|413769002
such as those with status migrainosus,|20401003|230467008|421463005|230467008
they
appear
to
be
the most effective treatment option.[88]|4757001|255403003|276239002|4757001|255403003|416118004|4757001|254648000|276239002|4757001|254648000|416118004

Intravenous metoclopramide|372776000|255560000|372776000
or
intranasal lidocaine|260617000|387480006
are
other potential options.|74964007|30207005

Metoclopramide|372776000
is
the recommended treatment|276239002|416118004
for those
who
present|52101004|246105001
to the emergency department.|225728007

A single dose|125681006|277406006|125681006|408102007|50607009|277406006|50607009|408102007
of intravenous dexamethasone,|372584003|255560000|372584003
when
added
to standard treatment|276239002|416118004
of a migraine attack,|37796009|217315002|37796009|216299002
is
associated|47429007
with a 26% decrease|260400001|260370003
in headache recurrence|25064002|246455001
in the following 72 hours.|255260001|123028004

Spinal manipulation|44275008
for treating|28995006
an ongoing migraine headache|255238004|37796009
is
not
supported|9096001|243114000
by evidence.|18669006

It
is
recommended
that opioids|404642006
and
barbiturates|372798009
not
be
used.[11]|394850002

Long term prognosis|20481000
in people|125676002
with migraines|37796009
is
variable.|255372005

Most people|125676002
with migraines|37796009
have
periods|259037005
of lost productivity
due to their disease[5] however typically|64572001
the condition|260905004
is
fairly benign[9]|30807003
and
is
not
associated|47429007
with an increased risk|35105006|30207005|260366006|30207005
of death.|419620001|268923008

There
are
four main patterns|421534005|63161005|272135003
to the disease|64572001
:
symptoms
can
resolve
completely,
symptoms
can
continue|255238004
but
become
gradually less
with time,|410669006
symptoms
may
continue|255238004
at the same frequency|262126009|260864003|262126009|272123002
and
severity,|272141005
or
attacks|216299002
may
become
worse|230993007|390772001|231877006
and
more frequent.[9]|242762006|70232002

Migraines|37796009
with aura|18618006
appears
to
be
a risk factor|80943009
for ischemic stroke[92]|422504002
doubling|1305003
the risk.|30207005

Being
a young adult,|84422007|133936004
being
female,|248152002|224526002
using|260676000
hormonal contraception,|278994005|13197004
and
smoking further|365981007|46053002
increases|260366006
this risk.|30207005

There also
appears
to
be
an association|263534001|272151006
with cervical artery dissection.|261064006|9406001

Migraines|37796009
without aura|18618006
do
not
appear
to
be
a factor.

The relationship|272151006
with heart problems|80891009|55607006|302509004|55607006
is
inconclusive|419984006
with a single study|125681006|110465008|125681006|224699009|50607009|110465008|50607009|224699009
supporting|9096001|243114000
an association.|263534001|272151006

Overall however migraines|37796009
do
not
appear
to
increase|260366006
the risk|30207005
of death|419620001|268923008
from stroke|230690007
or
heart disease.|56265001

Preventative therapy|276239002
of migraines|37796009
in those with migraines|20401003|37796009|421463005|37796009
with auras|18618006
may
prevent
associated strokes.[96]|47429007|230690007

Worldwide,
migraines|37796009
affect|4065008

Rates
of migraines|37796009
are
slightly lower|425404009|261122009
in Asia|223500001
and
Africa|223498002
than

Chronic migraines|90734009|37796009
occur|272120004
in approximately 1.4|26175008
to 2.2%|260306008
of the population.[98]|385436007|389109008

These figures
vary
substantially
with age|424144002
:
migraines most commonly|37796009
start|255395001
between 15
and
24 years|258707000
of age|424144002
and
occur|272120004
most frequently|70232002
in those 35

In children,|410601007|160499008
about 1.7%

and
3.9%|260282009
of those between 7|11896004
and
15 years|258707000
have
migraines,|37796009
with the condition|260905004
being
slightly more common|425404009|72906007
in boys|433152004
before puberty.|18991001

During adolescence migraines|22396007|37796009
becomes
more common|242762006|72906007
among women[99]|224526002
and
this
persists
for the rest|258157001
of the lifespan,
being
two times|420797005|410669006|420797005|417929005
more common|242762006|72906007
among elderly females|105436006|248152002
than males.|248153007

In women|224526002
migraines|37796009
without aura|18618006
is
more common|242762006|72906007
than migraines|37796009
with aura,|18618006
however
in men|339947000
the two types|420797005|261664005
occur|272120004
with similar frequency.[41]|260864003|272123002

During perimenopause symptoms often|70232002
get
worse|230993007|390772001|231877006
before decreasing|260371004
in severity.|272141005

While
symptoms
resolve
in about two thirds|420797005|70905002
of the elderly,|105436006
in
between 3|260313008
and
10%
they
persist.[28]

An early description|264499004
consistent|385433004
with migraines|37796009
is
contained|42504009
in the Ebers papyrus,
written|12261009
around 1200 BCE
in ancient Egypt.|223511009

In 200 BC,
writings
from the Hippocratic school|257698009
of medicine|410942007
described
the visual aura|255374006|18618006
that
can
precede|236874000
the headache|25064002
and
a partial relief|255609007|224978009
occurring|272120004
through vomiting.[102]|249497008

A second-century description|81170007|257997001|288495006
by Aretaeus
of Cappadocia divided headaches|422033008|25064002
into three types|421291004|261664005
:
cephalalgia,|25064002
cephalea,
and
heterocrania.

Galen|34385009
of Pergamon
used|394850002
the term hemicrania|85641006|103006007
(half-head|69536005|302548004
)
,
from which
the word migraine|255373000|37796009
was
eventually
derived.

He also
proposed
that
the pain|22253000
arose|68727004
from the meninges|363824000
and
blood vessels|59820001
of the head.|69536005|302548004

Migraines|37796009
were
first|255216001|232714002
divided|422033008
into the two now used types - migraine|420797005|394850002|261664005|37796009
with aura|18618006
(_migraine ophthalmique_|37796009
)
and
migraine|37796009
without aura|18618006
(_migraine vulgaire_|37796009
)
in 1887
by Louis Hyacinthe Thomas
a French Librarian.[102]|19434008|59142002

Trepanation,
the deliberate drilling|80342005
of holes
into a skull,|89546000
was
practiced
as early|264499004
as 7,000 BCE.

While
sometimes people|125676002
survived
,
many
would
have
died|419620001|419099009
from the procedure|71388002
due to infection.

It
was
believed
to
work|261041009
via "letting evil spirits|6524003
escape
".

William Harvey
recommended
trepanation
as a treatment|276239002|416118004
for migraines|37796009
in the 17th century.[106]

While
many treatments|276239002
for migraines|37796009
have
been
attempted
,
it
was
not
until 1868
that use|277889008|419385000
of a substance|105590001
which eventually
turned|282987006
out to|255529000
be
effective|255403003|254648000
began.|255395001

This substance|105590001
was
the fungus ergot|414561005|55811003|414561005
from which ergotamine|395975005
was
isolated|46651001
in 1918.

Methysergide|387044000
was
developed
in 1959
and
the first triptan,|255216001|232714002
sumatriptan,|395892000
was
developed
in 1988.

During the 20th century
with better study design effective preventative measures|3442003|110465008|255403003|246445000|3442003|110465008|255403003|367346004|3442003|110465008|254648000|246445000|3442003|110465008|254648000|367346004|3442003|224699009|255403003|246445000|3442003|224699009|255403003|367346004|3442003|224699009|254648000|246445000|3442003|224699009|254648000|367346004
where
found|404684003
and
confirmed.[102]|59156000

Migraines|37796009
are
a significant source|386134007|260753009
of
both
medical costs|74188005
and
lost productivity.

It
has
been
estimated|414135002
that
they
are
the most costly neurological disorder|4757001|118940003
in the European Community,|414152003|133928008|133928008
costing
more
than ?27 billion
per year.|258707000|259039008

In the United States|223688001
direct|255589003
costs
have
been
estimated|414135002
at 17 billion USD.

Nearly
a tenth|28226006
of this cost
is
due to the cost
of triptans.

Indirect costs|255541007
are
around 15 Billion USD,
of which
missed
work|261041009
is
the greatest component.|4757001|246093002

In those
who
do
attend|410542002
work|261041009
with a migraine effectiveness|37796009|255403003
is
decreased|1250004|260400001|260371004
by
around a third.|70905002

Negative|260385009
impacts|134293005
also frequently|70232002
occur|272120004
for a person's family.[108]|125676002|35359004

Calcitonin gene related peptides (CGRPs)|44609006
have
been
found|404684003
to
play|300776002
a role
in the pathogenesis|303109001
of the pain|22253000
associated|47429007
with migraine.|37796009

CGRP receptor antagonists,|116647005|58516001
such as olcegepant
and
telcagepant,
have
been
investigated|116698004
both
_
in vitro_
and
in clinical studies|58147004|110465008|58147004|224699009
for the treatment|276239002|416118004
of migraine.|37796009

In 2011,
Merck stopped phase III clinical trials|385654001|21191007|257471003|110465008
for their investigational drug telcagepant.|386053000|410942007

Transcranial magnetic stimulation also|264603002
shows
promise.[11]
