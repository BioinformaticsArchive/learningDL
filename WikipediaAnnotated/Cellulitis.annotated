*Cellulitis|128045006
*
*
is
a localized|255471002
or
diffuse inflammation|103626005
of connective tissue|181769001
with severe inflammation|103624008
of dermal|119325001|39937001|181469002
and
subcutaneous layers|263887005
of the skin.|119325001|39937001|181469002

Cellulitis|128045006
can
be
caused|23981006|134198009
by normal skin flora|23506009|119325001|23506009|39937001|23506009|181469002
or
by exogenous bacteria,|261074009|409822003|51352008|409822003
and
often|70232002
occurs|272120004
where the skin|119325001|39937001|181469002
has
previously
been
broken
:
cracks
in the skin,|119325001|39937001|181469002
cuts,|283396008
blisters,|408764000|247464001
burns,|125666000
insect bites,|276433004
surgical wounds,|112633009
intravenous drug injection|43060002|410942007|255560000
or
sites|10546003
of intravenous catheter insertion.|386339009|19923001|45211000|255560000|45211000

Skin|119325001|39937001|181469002
on the face|89545001|302549007
or
lower legs|40927001
is
most commonly|4757001
affected|247591002|248448006
by this infection,
though
cellulitis|128045006
can
occur|272120004
on any part|260726005
of the body.|279495008|123037004

The mainstay
of therapy|276239002
remains
treatment|276239002|416118004
with appropriate antibiotics,|255631004
and
recovery periods|259037005
last
from 48 hours|255249005
to six months.|422218008|258706009

Erysipelas|44653001
is
the term
used|394850002
for a more superficial infection|242762006|26283006
of the dermis|53534000
and
upper subcutaneous layer|261183002|261183002|263887005
that
presents|52101004|246105001
clinically
with a well-defined edge.|260409000|57183005

Erysipelas|44653001
and
cellulitis often|128045006|70232002
coexist
,
so
it
is
often difficult to|70232002|52925006
make
a distinction
between the two.|420797005

In Ludwig's angina,|196542004
an acute|272118002
and
potentially life threatening condition,|224130005|260905004
cellulitis|128045006
occurs|272120004
within the submandibular space.[1]|118656006

Cellulitis|128045006
is
unrelated|262241003
(
except etymologically
to cellulite,|248306003
a cosmetic condition featuring dimpling|81024003|260905004|25088000|261513001|260905004|25088000
of the skin.|119325001|39937001|181469002

The typical symptoms
of cellulitis|128045006
is
an area|42798000
which
is
red, hot,|386713009|264018002|371240000|264018002
and
tender.|300820003

The photos
shown
here
of cellulitis|128045006
are
of mild cases,|255604002|398241000|255604002|413769002
and
are
not representative
of earlier stages|264499004|261612004
of the condition.|260905004

Cellulitis|128045006
following|255260001
an abrasion.|262536007|8420001|399963005

Note
the red streaking|386713009|371240000
up the arm|40983000|53120007|182245002|302538001
from involvement|248448006
of the lymphatic system.|89890002

Infected

of symptoms

Cellulitis|128045006
of the leg|61685007|30021000|182281004|362793004
with foot involvement.|56459004|248448006|259051005|248448006|302545001|248448006

Cellulitis|128045006
is
caused|23981006|134198009
by a type|261664005
of bacteria|409822003
entering|417985001
the skin,|119325001|39937001|181469002
usually
by way
of a cut, abrasion,|283396008|262536007|283396008|8420001|283396008|399963005
or
break in
the skin.|119325001|39937001|181469002

This break
does
not
need|410525008|103325001
to
be
visible.|24054004

Group A _Streptococcus_|80166006
and
_Staphylococcus_|65119002
are
the most common|4757001|72906007
of these bacteria,|409822003
which
are
part|260726005
of the normal flora|23506009
of the skin,|119325001|39937001|181469002
but
normally
cause|23981006|134198009
no actual infection
while
on the skin's outer surface.|119325001|261074009|410678000|39937001|261074009|410678000|181469002|261074009|410678000

Dental infections|427898007
account
for approximately eighty percent|26175008|118582008
of cases|398241000|413769002
of Ludwig's angina,|196542004
or
cellulitis|128045006
of the submandibular space.|118656006

Mixed infections,|4559000
due to
both
aerobes|27471002
and
anaerobes,|59343002
are
commonly
associated|47429007
with the cellulitis|128045006
of Ludwig's angina.|196542004

Typically
this
includes|55919000
alpha-hemolytic streptococci,|60631002
staphylococci|65119002
and
bacteroides groups.[1]|57522007|258366009

Predisposing conditions|260905004
for cellulitis|128045006
include|55919000
insect|106763003
or
spider bite,|420814007|3404009|420814007|25272006
blistering,|408764000|247464001
animal bite,|418975000
tattoos,
pruritic
(itchy|424492005
)
skin rash,|271807003
recent surgery,|6493001|83578000
athlete's foot,|6020002
dry skin,|16386004
eczema,|281104002
injecting|422145002
drugs|410942007
(especially subcutaneous|263887005
or
intramuscular injection|76601001
or
where an attempted intravenous injection "|43060002
misses
"
or
blows
the vein|29092000|181367001
)
,
pregnancy,|289908002
diabetes|73211009
and
obesity,|414915002
which
can
affect|4065008
circulation,|413854007
as well as
burns|125666000
and
boils,|416675009
though
there
is
debate
as to
whether minor foot lesions|410599005|56459004|410599005|259051005|410599005|302545001|255606000|56459004|255606000|259051005|255606000|302545001
contribute.

Occurrences|272120004
of cellulitis|128045006
may
also
be
associated|47429007
with the rare condition hidradenitis suppurativa.|84638005|260905004|59393003|103356009|260905004|59393003

The appearance|386548000|255412001
of the skin|119325001|39937001|181469002
will
assist|116697009|119265000
a doctor|309343006
in determining
a diagnosis.|439401001

A doctor|309343006
may
also
suggest
blood tests,|252275004
a wound culture|267036007|252398009|267036007|61594008|13924000|252398009|13924000|61594008
or
other tests to|74964007|269814003|74964007|272393004
help
rule|10828004
out
a blood clot|396339007|75753009
deep|131197000
in the veins|29092000
of the legs.|30021000

Cellulitis|128045006
in the lower leg|30021000
is
characterized
by signs|72670004
and
symptoms
similar
to those
of a deep vein thrombosis,|128053003|404223003
such as warmth,|71384000
pain|22253000
and
swelling|423666004|442672001
(inflammation|257552002
).

This reddened skin|271811009
or
rash|271807003
may
signal|38952000
a deeper, more serious infection|131197000|42745003
of the inner layers|260521003
of skin.|119325001|39937001|181469002

Once
below the skin,|119325001|39937001|181469002
the bacteria|409822003
can
spread|410677005
rapidly,|418694008
entering|417985001
the lymph nodes|59441001
and
the bloodstream
and
spreading|410677005
throughout the body.|279495008|123037004

This
can
result|394617004
in influenza-like symptoms|315642008
with a high temperature|386661006|285717004
and
sweating|161857006
or
feeling|285854004
very cold|260358002|285686007|260358002|82272006|260358002|84162001
with shaking,|26079004
as
the sufferer
cannot
get
warm.

In rare cases,|84638005|398241000|84638005|413769002|103356009|398241000|103356009|413769002
the infection
can
spread|410677005
to the deep layer|131197000
of tissue|85756007
called
the fascial lining.|84820005|50009006

Necrotizing fasciitis,|52486002
also
called
by the media "flesh-eating bacteria",|61695000|48263008|409822003
is
an example
of a deep-layer infection.|131197000

It
is
a medical emergency.|74188005|25876001

The elderly|105436006
and
those
with immunodeficiency|234532001
(
a weakened immune system|116003000
)
are
especially vulnerable
to contracting cellulitis.|78558002|128045006

Diabetics
are
more susceptible|242762006|131196009
to cellulitis|128045006
than the general population|60132005|385436007|60132005|389109008
because of impairment|40226000
of the immune system|116003000
;
they
are
especially prone|1240000
to cellulitis|128045006
in the feet,|56459004|259051005
because
the disease|64572001
causes|134198009
impairment|40226000
of blood circulation|87612001|413854007|119273009|413854007
in the legs,|30021000
leading|236874000
to diabetic foot/foot ulcers.|280137006|371087003

Poor control|11403006|31509003|255351007|31509003
of blood glucose levels|365812005
allows
bacteria to|409822003
grow
more rapidly|242762006|418694008
in the affected tissue,|247591002|85756007|248448006|85756007
and
facilitates
rapid progression|255358001|246453008|255358001|246450006
if
the infection
enters|417985001
the bloodstream.

Neural degeneration|3057000|33359002|256864008|33359002
in diabetes means|73211009|255586005
these ulcers|429040005
may
not
be
painful|22253000
and
thus often|70232002
become
infected.

Those
who
have
suffered poliomyelitis|398102009
are
also prone|1240000
because of circulatory problems,|413854007|55607006
especially
in the legs.|30021000

Immunosuppressive drugs,|372823004|410942007
and
other illnesses|74964007|39104002
or
infections
that
weaken
the immune system,|116003000
are
also factors
that
make
infection more likely.|2931005

Chickenpox|38907003
and
shingles often|4740000|70232002
result|394617004
in blisters|408764000|247464001
that
break
open,|56116003
providing
a gap
in the skin|119325001|39937001|181469002
through which bacteria|409822003
can
enter.|417985001

Lymphedema,|234097001
which
causes|134198009
swelling|423666004|442672001
on the arms|40983000
and/or
legs,|30021000
can
also
put
an individual|125676002|385435006
at risk.|410519009

Diseases|64572001
that
affect|4065008
blood circulation|87612001|413854007|119273009|413854007
in the legs|30021000
and
feet,|56459004|259051005
such as chronic venous insufficiency
and
varicose veins,|128060009
are
also risk factors|80943009
for cellulitis.|128045006

Cellulitis|128045006
is
also extremely prevalent
among dense populations|255596001|385436007
sharing
hygiene facilities|284779002
and
common living quarters,|72906007|74397004
such as military installations,|302314004
college dormitories,|224864007
nursing homes,|42665001
oil platforms|21847005|421890007
and
homeless shelters.|266935003

It
is
advised|424900004
if
a cabin
is
shared
with a sufferer,
urgent medical treatment|103391001|74188005|276239002|103391001|74188005|416118004
should
be
given.|419582001

Cellulitis|128045006
is
most often|4757001|70232002
a clinical diagnosis,|39154008
and
local cultures|255470001|252398009|255470001|61594008
do
not always
identify|7882003
the causative organism.|410653004

Blood|87612001|119273009
cultures|252398009|61594008
usually
are
positive only|258758003|10828004
if
the patient|116154003
develops
generalized sepsis.|60132005|105592009|60132005|91302008

Conditions|78326006|260905004
that
may
resemble
cellulitis|128045006
include|55919000
deep vein thrombosis,|128053003|404223003
which
can
be
diagnosed|439401001
with a compression leg ultrasound,|71173004|61685007|359659005|71173004|30021000|359659005|71173004|182281004|359659005|71173004|362793004|359659005|263720003|61685007|359659005|263720003|30021000|359659005|263720003|182281004|359659005|263720003|362793004|359659005
and
stasis dermatitis,|366362000
which
is
inflammation|257552002
of the skin|119325001|39937001|181469002
from poor blood flow.|11403006|58190003|255351007|58190003

Associated musculoskeletal findings|47429007|106028002
are
sometimes
reported.|229059009|223458004

When
it
occurs|272120004
with acne conglobata,|42228007
hidradenitis suppurativa,|59393003
and
pilonidal cysts,|47639008
the syndrome
is
referred to|439980006
as
the follicular occlusion triad|404175004
or
tetrad.[2]

Lyme disease|23502006
can
be
misdiagnosed
as staphylococcal-|65119002
or
streptococcal-induced cellulitis.|278037002|16404004

Because
the characteristic bullseye rash|271807003
does
not always
appear
in patients|116154003
infected
with Lyme disease,|23502006
the similar set
of symptoms
may
be
misdiagnosed
as cellulitis.|128045006

Standard treatments|276239002
for cellulitis|128045006
are
not sufficient|51117008
for curing Lyme disease.|23502006

The only way to|50607009|420295001
rule|10828004
out Lyme disease|255529000|23502006
is
with a blood test,|252275004
which
is
recommended
during warm months|258706009
in areas|42798000
where the disease|64572001
is
endemic.[3]

Treatment|276239002|416118004
consists
of resting|258157001
the affected area,|247591002|42798000|248448006|42798000
cutting|70302008|410717008
away dead tissue,|419620001|85756007
and
antibiotics|255631004
(
either
oral|260548002
or
intravenous.|255560000

Flucloxacillin|387544009
or
dicloxacillin monotherapy|372873001
(to
cover|255334000
staphylococcal infection|56038003
)
is
often sufficient|70232002|51117008
in mild cellulitis,|255604002|128045006
but
in more moderate cases,|242762006|6736007|398241000|242762006|6736007|413769002
or
where streptococcal infection|85769006
is
suspected,|415684004
then
this course|288524001
is
usually
combined|89780004
with oral phenoxymethylpenicillin|260548002|372725003
or
intravenous benzylpenicillin,|78507004|255560000|78507004
or
ampicillin/amoxicillin.|387170002|372687004

Pain relief|182970005
is
also often|70232002
prescribed,
but
excessive pain|260378005|22253000
should
always
be
investigated|116698004
as
it
is
a symptom
of necrotizing fasciitis.|52486002

Elevation|103720008|255456001
of the affected area|247591002|42798000|248448006|42798000
is
also important.

As
in other maladies|74964007
characterized
by wounds|13924000
or
tissue destruction,|85756007|64597002
hyperbaric oxygen treatment|18678000|24099007
can
be
a valuable adjunctive therapy,|276239002
but
is
not widely available.[5][6]|103328004

Horses|35354009
may
acquire|255396000
cellulitis,|128045006
usually secondary|2603003|81170007
to a wound|13924000
(
which
can
be
extremely small|255507004
and
superficial|26283006
)
or
to a deep-tissue infection,|131197000|85756007
such as an abscess|128477000
or
infected bone,|272673000|3138006|90780006|128530007
tendon sheath,|15434002
or
joint.|39352004|81087007|302536002

Cellulitis|128045006
from a superficial wound|37205004
will
usually
create
less
lameness|16973004|275520000
(grade 1?2
out of 5|264706000|264605009
)
than that
caused|23981006|134198009
by septic arthritis|372938004|372939007
(grade 4?5 lameness|16973004|275520000|16973004|275520000
).

The horse|35354009|388441000|388445009
will
exhibit
inflammatory edema,|103619005
which
is
marked|46998006
by hot, painful swelling.|36349006|423666004|36349006|442672001

This swelling|423666004|442672001
differs
from stocking|228184002
up
in
that
the horse|35354009|388441000|388445009
will
not
display
symmetrical swelling|18772005|423666004|18772005|442672001
in two|420797005
or
four legs,|421534005|30021000
but
in only one leg.|50607009|421379005|61685007|50607009|421379005|30021000|50607009|421379005|182281004|50607009|421379005|362793004|420295001|421379005|61685007|420295001|421379005|30021000|420295001|421379005|182281004|420295001|421379005|362793004

This swelling|423666004|442672001
begins|255395001
near the source|260753009
of infection,
but
will
eventually
continue|255238004
down the leg.|61685007|30021000|182281004|362793004

In some cases,|398241000|413769002
the swelling|423666004|442672001
will
also
travel|420008001
upward.|353734004

Treatment|276239002|416118004
includes|55919000
cleaning|228402009
the wound|13924000
and
caring
for it properly,
the administration|413454004|416118004
of NSAIDs,|372665008
such as phenylbutazone,|273951003
cold hosing,|285686007|82272006|84162001
applying|410618006|417924000
a sweat wrap|74616000|161857006
or
a poultice,|385117009
and
mild exercise.|255604002|61686008

Veterinarians|106290006
may
also
prescribe
antibiotics.|255631004

Cellulitis|128045006
is
also
seen
in staphylococcus|65119002
and
corynebacterium mixed infections|397434007|26242008
in bulls.[9]
