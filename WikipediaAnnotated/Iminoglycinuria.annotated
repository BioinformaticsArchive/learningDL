[1][2][3]|303183002
is
an autosomal recessive[4] disorder|258211005|64572001
of renal tubular transport affecting reabsorption|64033007|6057008|57188001|247591002|64033007|6057008|57188001|248448006|64033007|6057008|360300001|247591002|64033007|6057008|360300001|248448006
of the amino acid glycine,|52518006|15331006|52518006|47390004
and
the imino acids proline|39862002|52541003
and
hydroxyproline.|74727008

This results|394617004
in excess urinary excretion|260378005|63911002
of all three acids|421291004|34957004
(_-uria_ denotes "|423149002
in the urine"|78014005
).[6]

Iminoglycinuria|84121007
is
a rare|84638005|103356009
and
complex disorder,|103360007|64572001
associated|47429007
with a number|410680006|410681005
of genetic mutations|55446002
that
cause|23981006|134198009
defects|6920004
in
both
renal|64033007
and
intestinal transport systems|261093006|57188001|246333005|261093006|360300001|246333005
of glycine|15331006|47390004
and
imino acids.[4][7][8][9]|39862002

Imino acids typically|39862002
contain|42504009
an imine functional group,|40143009|261586004|40143009|160481000|40143009|389109008|246464006|261586004|246464006|160481000|246464006|389109008
instead of the amino group|261586004|160481000|389109008
found|404684003
in amino acids.|52518006

Proline|52541003
is
considered
and
usually
referred|439980006
to
as
an amino acid,|52518006
[10][11]
but
unlike others,|74964007
it
has
a secondary amine.|2603003|43201005|81170007|43201005

This feature,
unique
to proline,|52541003
identifies|7882003
proline also|52541003
as an imino acid.|39862002

Hydroxyproline|74727008
is
another imino acid,|39862002
made
from the naturally
occurring|272120004
hydroxylation
of proline.|52541003

Proline|52541003

Hydroxyproline|74727008

The primary characteristic|63161005|261424001
of iminoglycinuria|84121007
is
the presence|386397008
of glycine|15331006|47390004
and
imino acids|39862002
in the urine.|78014005

Otherwise,
it
is
thought to|88952004
be
a relatively benign disorder,|30807003|64572001
[6][14]
although
symptoms
associated|47429007
with disruptions|76555007
of proline|52541003
and
glycine metabolism|15331006|47722004|47390004|47722004
caused|23981006|134198009
by malabsorption|32230006
may
be
present|52101004|246105001
with iminoglycinuria.|84121007

These
include|55919000
encephalopathy,
mental retardation,|91138005
[2] deafness,|260306008|260306008|343087000|260306008|8531006
[3] blindness,|260313008
[16] kidney stones,|95570007|444717006
[17] hypertension[18]|38341003
and
gyrate atrophy.[19]|314467007

Gyrate atrophy|314467007
is
an inherited degenerative disorder|255404009|362975008
of the retina|5665001|181171005
and
choroid,|68703001|181172003
[20] sometimes
accompanying
the metabolic condition hyperornithinemia.|260905004|33985005

The presence|386397008
of gyrate atrophy|314467007
with iminoglycinuria|84121007
stems
from a deficiency|260372006|248325000
of proline|52541003
in chorioretinal tissues,|85756007
while
processes|415178003
behind hyperornithinemia|33985005
disrupt
the metabolic pathway|129457002
from ornithine|8514004
to proline,|52541003
which
alters
the catabolism|40091007
of ornithine,|8514004
and
also
results|394617004
in reduced levels|260400001|258395000
of proline.|52541003

Thus,
gyrate atrophy|314467007
can
be
found|404684003
with
either
disorder,|64572001
with proline deficiency|52541003|260372006|52541003|248325000
as an underlying feature.[19][22]

Hyperglycinuria
is
another disorder affecting reabsorption|64572001|247591002|64572001|248448006
of glycine|15331006|47390004
and
imino acids,|39862002
similar
to iminoglycinuria|84121007
and
considered
to
be
a heterozygous form.|14556007|246176004

When
accompanied
by a specific type|69658003|261664005
of kidney stone|95570007
(nephrolithiasis
)
,
it
is
sometimes
referred|439980006
to
as
"iminoglycinuria,|84121007
type II".[15][23][24]|258195006|264657009

Glycine,|15331006|47390004
proline|52541003
and
hydroxyproline|74727008
share
common renal tubular mechanisms|72906007|58471003|257544000|72906007|361332007|257544000
of reabsorption,
[7]
a function|246464006
specific|69658003
to the proximal tubule.|50468005

Both
reabsorption
or
absorption
of glycine|15331006|47390004
and
imino acids|39862002
takes|419652001
place|257557008|421066005
respectively
at the proximal tubule|50468005
or
intestinal brush border epithelium.|72517000|17599007|266135004|17599007

The more selective transport|242762006|57188001|242762006|360300001
of proline|52541003
and
other imino acids|74964007|39862002
is
driven|129060000|247750002
at the molecular level|290005005|258395000|290005005|276625007
by a mammalian cellular transport mechanism aptly|387976007|4421005|57188001|257544000|387976007|4421005|360300001|257544000
known|36692007
as system IMINO.[5][25][26]|246333005

While
no single genetic mutation|125681006|55446002|50607009|55446002
has
been
established|263748003|385645004
as the cause|134198009
of iminoglycinuria|84121007
;
several mutations,|261028005|55446002
affecting|247591002|248448006
transport mechanisms|57188001|257544000|360300001|257544000
shared
by glycine,|15331006|47390004
proline|52541003
and
hydroxyproline,|74727008
as well as
those
that selectively
transport|57188001|360300001
either
glycine|15331006|47390004
or
imino acids,|39862002
including|55919000
the IMINO system,|246333005
are
known|36692007
to
be
associated|47429007
with the disorder.|64572001

When
combined|89780004
,
these factors
will
result|394617004
in a variable phenotype|255372005|8116006|255372005|363778006
for iminoglycinuria|84121007
depending
on which mutations|55446002
are
present.|52101004|246105001

However,
despite
the role
that intestinal malabsorption|32230006
of glycine|15331006|47390004
and
imino acids|39862002
can
play|300776002
in iminoglycinuria,|84121007
the primary defect|63161005|6920004|261424001|6920004
disrupts
their renal transport|64033007|57188001|64033007|360300001
and
reabsorption.

This
is
evident,|18669006
as
inherited iminoglycinuria|255404009|84121007
can
be
clinically
present|52101004|246105001
with no intestinal involvement.[16]|261093006|248448006

In mammals,|387976007
including|55919000
humans,|278412004
the transport|57188001|360300001
of amino
and
imino acids|39862002
from the lumen|113342003|342806003|398252006
(interior
)
of the intestine|261093006
or
the renal proximal tubule|58471003|40415009|361332007|40415009|64033007|50468005
into the cells|4421005
occurs|272120004
at the brush border membrane|17599007|83097008
of the epithelium|31610004
(moist,|17461003
tightly
packed|53999001
cellular lining|4421005|50009006
of many tissues|85756007
and
organs|410653004
of the body|279495008|123037004
).

Here,
cotransporters
such as sodium|39972003
or
chloride|50213009
(part|260726005
of the system|246333005
of Na-K-Cl cotransporters|385432009
couple
with the amino
or
imino acids|39862002
on the molecular level|290005005|258395000|290005005|276625007
and
transport|57188001|360300001
them
through specific integral membrane proteins|69658003|263786007|83097008|88878007
that
form|246176004
ion channels,|48006008|255592004
which
are
located
within the cell membrane.|53982002

From the cells,|4421005
the absorbed
or
reabsorbed amino
and
imino acids eventually|39862002
reach|282679008
the blood.|87612001|119273009

Absorption refers|439980006
to the overall process happening|415178003
in the intestine|261093006
in lieu
of normal digestive breakdown|17621005|106079008|40091007|17621005|106079008|125366008|17621005|86762007|40091007|17621005|86762007|125366008|258744000|106079008|40091007|258744000|106079008|125366008|258744000|86762007|40091007|258744000|86762007|125366008
of proteins,|88878007
while
reabsorption refers|439980006
to the process|415178003
occurring|272120004
in the renal proximal tubule to|58471003|40415009|361332007|40415009|64033007|50468005
reclaim
amino
and
imino acids|39862002
that
have
been
filtered|116250002|258648006
out of the blood|87612001|119273009
via the glomerulus.|68288006

These forms|246176004
of transport|57188001|360300001
require
energy,|248272003
as
the products
being
transported|57188001|360300001
are
usually
moving
against a higher concentration gradient.|75540009|82742001|272077000|371879000|82742001|272077000

This process,|415178003
called
active transport,|6886007
get
its energy|248272003
from ATP
and
other ATP-related cotransport systems|74964007|272151006|246333005|74964007|262094002|246333005
that
produce
energy,|248272003
like the sodium-potassium pump.|23736002

The primary defect|63161005|6920004|261424001|6920004
associated|47429007
with iminoglycinuria|84121007
is
a homozygous|22061001
(recessive
)
mutation|55446002
of the _SLC36A2_
(PAT2
)
gene.|67271001

One|421379005
of several membrane transport proteins|261028005|83097008|16267005
in the solute carrier family|47461006|35359004|29679002|35359004
of amino acid transporters,|52518006
PAT2
is
the high-affinity renal transporter|75540009|64033007|371879000|64033007
of glycine,|15331006|47390004
proline|52541003
and
hydroxyproline|74727008
found|404684003
to
be
defective
in
both
alleles|9109004
when
iminoglycinuria|84121007
is
present|52101004|246105001
in an individual.|125676002|385435006

This
is
in contrast
to the fact
that
when
only one PAT2 allele|50607009|421379005|9109004|420295001|421379005|9109004
is
defective, hyperglycinuria
will
be
present|52101004|246105001
instead of iminoglycinuria.|84121007

These findings|404684003
delineate
iminoglycinuria|84121007
as the homozygous form|22061001|246176004
of hyperglycinuria,
with the former|9130008
having
a higher degree|75540009|258395000|75540009|246173007|371879000|258395000|371879000|246173007
of urinary excretion|63911002
of glycine|15331006|47390004
and
imino acids|39862002
correlating
to mutations|55446002
in
both
alleles.[4][7]|9109004

Another mutation|55446002
suspected|415684004
to
convey
the iminoglycinuria phenotype|84121007|8116006|84121007|363778006
may
be
found|404684003
in the _SLC36A1_
(PAT1
)
gene.|67271001

Identified|7882003
as the low-affinity intestinal transporter|62482003|261093006|371880002|261093006
of glycine|15331006|47390004
and
imino acids,|39862002
PAT1
works|261041009
in cooperation
with the renal sodium-hydrogen exchanger NHE3|64033007|39972003|2141009
(_SLC9A3_
).

As absorption
and
reabsorption
of glycine,|15331006|47390004
proline|52541003
and
hydroxyproline|74727008
occurs|272120004
through PAT1
as well,|20572008
it
is
believed to
play|300776002
another role
in expressing
the malabsorptive iminoglycinuria phenotype.|84121007|8116006|84121007|363778006

Recent reports,|6493001|229059009|6493001|223458004
however,
suggest
a more diminished role|242762006|1250004
from PAT1
in some cases|398241000|413769002
of the disorder.[4][5][29][30]|64572001

While
PAT2
is
strongly
indicated|410535002
as the primary mutagen|63161005|261424001
responsible|394851003
for iminoglycinuria,|84121007
the variability|255372005
of the phenotype|8116006|363778006
is
found to|404684003
be
instituted|385437003
by three modifying genetic mutations.|421291004|55446002|421291004|243326001|55446002

The major one|255603008|421379005
among these
is
believed to
be
system IMINO.[4]|246333005

Defined
as the sodium-dependant proline transporter|39972003|371154000|52541003
not
inhibited|61511001
by alanine,|58753009
system IMINO,|246333005
believed
to
be
formed|35810008
by the _SLC6A20_
(SIT1
)
gene,|67271001
is
a crucial mammalian transport mechanism|387976007|57188001|257544000|387976007|360300001|257544000
responsible|394851003
for
both
renal reabsorption|64033007
and
intestinal absorption|38597004
of proline|52541003
and
other imino acids,|74964007|39862002
such as hydroxyproline|74727008
and
pipecolate.

The mRNA sequence|69908008|72633008
for SIT1
is
expressed
in a great deal|255509001|263768009
of the gastrointestinal tract,|122865005|279972009
including|55919000

It
is
also

Reduced penetrance|260400001|53568006
is
a phenomenon
where a fully
inherited|255404009
genetic trait,|3950001|255395001
such as a disease|64572001
or
disorder,|64572001
fails
to
exhibit
the expected phenotype.|8116006|363778006

This
has
been
reported|229059009|223458004
in some cases|398241000|413769002
of iminoglycinuria.|84121007

Here,
system IMINO|246333005
is
thought to|88952004
play|300776002
a role
in reduced penetrance|260400001|53568006
of iminoglycinuria|84121007
by compensating|17275008
for imino acid malabsorption|39862002|32230006
related|272151006|262094002
specifically
to mutations|55446002
of PAT2.

Conversely,
SIT1 mutations|55446002
are
believed
to
result|394617004
in full expression|261015003|10012005
of iminoglycinuria|84121007
in some cases|398241000|413769002
where heterozygous mutations|14556007|55446002
of PAT2
would
otherwise
have
only
been
sufficient to|51117008
cause|23981006|134198009
hyperglycinuria.[4]

Two other transport systems|420797005|57188001|246333005|420797005|360300001|246333005
are
believed
to
play|300776002
subsequent roles|255260001
in iminoglycinuria,|84121007
when
mutations|55446002
in them
are
present.|52101004|246105001

The neutral amino acid transporter _SLC6A19_|4963003
(affecting glycine,|247591002|15331006|247591002|47390004|248448006|15331006|248448006|47390004
proline,|52541003
and
other neutral amino acids|74964007|4963003
like cysteine|5932006
and
tryptophan,|54821000
associated|47429007
with Hartnup disease,|124208000
plays|300776002
a role
in iminoglycinuria|84121007
as a modifier
to PAT2 mutations|55446002
and
is
also directly
affected|247591002|248448006
by the actions|129264002
of SIT1.

The glycine-specific transporter,|15331006|69658003|47390004|69658003
_SLC6A18_,
also
has
an effect|253861007
on the iminoglycinuria phenotype|84121007|8116006|84121007|363778006
by
either
compounding|62105006
or
compensating|17275008
for failures|76797004
of glycine transport.[4]|15331006|57188001|15331006|360300001|47390004|57188001|47390004|360300001

To
summarize
,
iminoglycinuria|84121007
is
primarily
expressed
by homozygous mutations|22061001|55446002
of the PAT2 renal transporter,|64033007
while
the overall iminoglycinuria phenotype|84121007|8116006|84121007|363778006
may
be
modified|243326001
by normal|17621005|258744000
or
defective activity|48761009|55561003|258745004|257733005
of SIT1
(IMINO
)
,
_SLC6A19_
and
_SLC6A18_.[4]

Iminoglycinuria|84121007
is
believed to
be
inherited|255404009
in an autosomal recessive manner.|258211005

This means|255586005
a defective gene|67271001
responsible|394851003
for the disorder|64572001
is
located
on an autosome,
and
inheritance|246071007
requires
two copies|420797005
of the defective gene?one|67271001|421379005
from each parent.|40683002

Parents|40683002
of an individual|125676002|385435006
with an autosomal recessive disorder|258211005|64572001
both
carry|288345009
one copy|421379005
of the defective gene,|67271001
but
usually
do
not
experience
any signs|72670004
or
symptoms
of the disorder.|64572001

A non-inherited cause|255404009|134198009
of excess urinary excretion|260378005|63911002
of proline|52541003
and
glycine,|15331006|47390004
similar
to that
found|404684003
in iminoglycinuria,|84121007
is
quite common|72906007
to newborn infants|133933007
younger|84422007
than 6 months.|258706009

Sometimes
referred|439980006
to
as
neonatal iminoglycinuria,|25765006
it
is
due to underdevelopment|38146002
of high-affinity transport mechanisms|75540009|57188001|257544000|75540009|360300001|257544000|371879000|57188001|257544000|371879000|360300001|257544000
within the renal circuit,|64033007
specifically PAT2,
SIT1
and
SLC6A18.

The condition corrects|260905004|370975003
itself
with age.|424144002

In cases|398241000|413769002
where this
persists
beyond childhood,|68433009
however,
inherited hyperglycinuria|255404009
or
iminoglycinuria|84121007
may
be
suspected.[4]|415684004
