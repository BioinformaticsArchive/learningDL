There
are
4 forms|260308009|246176004
of stringhalt|28757007
:
[1][2]|303183002

Treatment|276239002|416118004
varies.

Australian Stringhalt|28757007
was
described
and
differentiated|263933003
from classical stringhalt|255333006|28757007|260997001|28757007
in 1884.

Australian Stringhalt|28757007
is
differentiated|263933003
from classical stringhalt|255333006|28757007|260997001|28757007
by the severity,|272141005
occurrence|272120004
of outbreaks,|443684005
distinct seasonal pattern|21864008|272135003
and
the ability|371150009
of affected horses to|247591002|35354009|248448006|35354009
recover|74822006
spontaneously.

This condition|260905004
is
characterized
by the sudden exaggerated flexion|255363002|260377000|9964006
of
either
one|421379005
or
both hocks.

This form|246176004
of stringhalt most commonly|28757007
occurs|272120004
in the summer
and
autumn months|258706009
while
horses|35354009
are
out
on pasture.

Epidemics
of Australian Stringhalt|28757007
are
usually
witnessed
during drought
or
abnormally dry conditions.|13880007|260905004

The long digital extensor muscle|255511005|261006005|91727004|255511005|82680008|91727004
(usually
in the hind limb|61685007|182281004|410029009|116013008
)
is
the muscle|91727004
that
appears
to
be
the most|4757001
affected|247591002|248448006
by this condition.|260905004

The most severe muscle lesions|4757001|24484000|91727004
have
been
found|404684003
within the long|255511005
and
lateral digital extensors|49370004|261006005|49370004|82680008
and
lateral deep digital flexor.|49370004|131197000|261006005|49370004|131197000|82680008

The location|246267002
of neuromuscular lesions
in Australian Stringhalt|28757007
may
be
explained
by the susceptibility|76522002|118588007
of longer,|255511005
larger myelinated nerve fibres|255509001|54115001|263768009|54115001
to injury.

Regenerating nerve fibres|88545005
with disproportionately thin myelin sheaths|18043004|23879005
are
more common|242762006|72906007
in the proximal parts|40415009|260726005
of affected nerves|247591002|3057000|248448006|3057000
in horses|35354009
with Australian Stringhalt.|28757007

Distal axonopathy|46053002
occurs|272120004
most severely|24484000
in the longest nerve|255511005|3057000|255511005|256864008
in the horse.|35354009|388441000|388445009

The cause|134198009
for this distal axonopathy remains|46053002
unknown.[8]|261665006

Horses|35354009
affected|247591002|248448006
with this condition rarely|260905004|103356009
recover|74822006
without surgical intervention,|83578000
although
there
have
been
some instances
where horses|35354009
have
recovered|74822006
without treatment.|276239002|416118004

The recovery time|410669006
in affected horses|247591002|35354009|248448006|35354009
can
range
from three months|421291004|258706009
to three years.|421291004|258707000

Horses|35354009
may
be
affected|247591002|248448006
so severely|223528007|24484000
that euthanasia|28631002
is
necessary.

It
is
unknown|261665006
as to
how long|255511005
it
takes|419652001
for clinical signs to|58147004|72670004
develop
after the exposure|71677004|24932003
to the cause|134198009
of the condition.[10]|260905004

The majority
of horses|35354009
affected|247591002|248448006
by stringhalt|28757007
are
dependent|371154000
upon pasture
for nutrition.|87276001|384759009

Removal|118292001|128303001
of the horse|35354009|388441000|388445009
from its original paddock|19535007
containing|42504009
low quality pasture,|62482003|263496004|371880002|263496004
weeds
and
native grasses,|263818007|422304003
along
with dietary control,|41829006|31509003
was
the most common|4757001|72906007
and
successful treatment.|182985004

Lateral digital extensor tenectomy|49370004|261006005|49370004|82680008
has
also
been
used|394850002
as a treatment|276239002|416118004
by veterinarians|106290006
with a success rate|385669000
of just over 50 percent.[12]|21481007|118582008

Phenytoin|387220006
has
been
used|394850002
in the management|413454004|119270007
of Australian Stringhalt.|28757007

Two weeks|420797005|258705008
after treatment|276239002|416118004
with phenytoin,|387220006
significant improvement|386134007
was
observed
in the gait abnormality|22325002
of horses|35354009
affected|247591002|248448006
with Australian Stringhalt|28757007
at the trot
and
canter,
but
no significant improvement|386134007
was
observed
at the walk|129006008
or
while
turning.[14]|282987006

The most common plant species|4757001|72906007|31006001|69658003
that
have
been
found|404684003
and
identified|7882003
in pastures
where
affected|247591002|248448006
horses|35354009
were
located
include|55919000
:
Flatweed
(_Hypochaeris radicata_|372927004
)
,
Sheep Sorrel|388254009|17272006|255392003|17272006
and

The type|261664005
of nerve damage|57182000
sustained|263892007
in horses|35354009
with Australian Stringhalt|28757007
suggests
a mould toxin|84489001|80917008
(?mycotoxin?|44644008
)
or
a fungal ?poison?|44644008
found|404684003
in the soils|415555003
may
be
a cause|134198009
for this condition.|260905004

Mycotoxins|44644008
can
directly
affect|4065008
the long myelinated nerves|255511005|23879005|3057000
in the hind limbs.[15]|116013008
