*Developmental dyspraxia
*
*
is
a chronic neurological disorder beginning|27624003|1199008|255395001|90734009|118940003|255395001
in childhood|68433009
that
can
affect|4065008
planning|312011006|397943006
of movements|255324009
and
co-ordination
as a result|394617004
of brain messages|12738006|258335003
not
being
accurately
transmitted|60117003|258150004
to the body.|279495008|123037004

Up to 50%
of dyspraxics
have
ADHD.|406506008

It
may
be
diagnosed|439401001
in the absence|2667000|418560003
of other motor|74964007
or
sensory impairments|262139008|40226000
like cerebral palsy,|128188000
[3] muscular dystrophy,|260313008|73297009
multiple sclerosis|24700007
or
Parkinson's disease.|49049000

Developmental dyspraxia
(
referred|439980006
to
as
developmental coordination disorder (DCD)[4][5][6][7][8]|27544004
in the
US
and
Europe|223502009
)
is
a lifelong neurological condition|1199008|260905004
that
is
more common|242762006|72906007
in males|248153007
than
in females,|248152002
with a ratio|118586006
of approximately four males|26175008|421534005|248153007
to every female.|248152002|224526002

The exact proportion|8212001
of people|125676002
with the disorder|64572001
is
unknown|261665006
since
the disorder|64572001
can
be
difficult to|52925006
detect|260373001
due to a lack|41277001
of specific laboratory tests,|69658003|269814003
thus
making
diagnosis|439401001
of the condition one|260905004|421379005
of elimination|63911002
of all other possible causes/diseases.|74964007|371930009|134198009|64572001|74964007|60022001|134198009|64572001

Current|15240007
estimates|414135002
range
from 5%|264706000|264605009
to 20%
with 5?6%|260271001
being
the most frequently quoted percentage|4757001|70232002|118582008
in the literature.

Some estimates|414135002
show
that
up to 1|260305007
in 30 children|410601007|160499008
may
have
dyspraxia.[9]|6950007

Assessments|386053000
for dyspraxia typically|6950007
require
a developmental history,|278923009|278923009|392521001
detailing ages|424144002
at which significant developmental milestones,|386134007|278923009
such as crawling|418594001
and
walking,|129006008
occurred.|272120004

Motor skills
screening|20135006
includes|55919000
activities|257733005
designed
to
indicate|410535002
dyspraxia,|6950007
including|55919000
balancing,|249982003|282298003
physical sequencing,|5880005|19388002
touch sensitivity,|247328001
and
variations|40885006
on walking activities.|129006008

A baseline motor assessment|386053000
establishes|263748003|385645004
the starting point|255395001|385652002
for developmental intervention programs.|386399006|225334002

Comparing children|410601007|160499008
to normal rates|17621005|258744000
of development|278923009
may
help
to
establish|263748003
areas|42798000
of significant difficulty.|386134007|371157007

However,
research
in the _British Journal
of Special Education_|67995009|266981003|67995009|409073007
has
shown
that knowledge|225795001
is
severely|24484000
limited|255469002
in many|260396001
who
should
be
trained|118629009|62193008
to recognise
and
respond
to various difficulties,|256220008|371157007
including|55919000
developmental coordination disorder,|27544004
dyslexia|59770006
and
Deficits|260372006
in attention,|6769007
motor control|31509003
and
perception|81742003
(DAMP|17461003
).

The earlier|264499004
that difficulties|371157007
are
noted
and
timely assessments|386053000
occur|272120004
,
the quicker intervention|255358001|225334002
can
begin.|255395001

A teacher|106304008
or
GP
could
miss
a diagnosis|439401001
if
they
are
only
applying|410618006|417924000
a cursory knowledge.|225795001

"Teachers|106304008
will
not
be
able|371150009
to recognise
or
accommodate
the child|410601007|160499008
with learning difficulties|161129001
in class|258391009
if
their knowledge|225795001
is
limited.|255469002

Similarly GPs|51720005
will
find
it difficult to|52925006
detect|260373001
and
appropriately
refer|439980006
children|410601007|160499008
with learning difficulties."[10]|161129001

Various areas|256220008|42798000
of development|278923009
can
be
affected|247591002|248448006
by developmental dyspraxia
and
these
will
persist
into adulthood,|41847000
[7]
as dyspraxia|6950007
has
no cure.

Often various coping strategies|70232002|256220008|405056001
are
developed
,
and
these
can
be
enhanced
through occupational therapy,|84478008
physiotherapy,|91251008
speech therapy,|5154007
or
psychological training.|60224009|118629009

Developmental verbal dyspraxia (DVD)|229703009
is
a type|261664005
of ideational dyspraxia,|66397001
causing|23981006
linguistic
or
phonological impairment.|229719002

This
is
the favoured term
in the UK
;
however,
it
is
also sometimes
referred|439980006
to
as
articulatory dyspraxia,|63416000
and
in the United States|223688001
the usual term
is
childhood apraxia of speech (CAS).[11]|68433009|74227009

Key problems|55607006
include|55919000
:

Difficulties|371157007
with fine motor co-ordination|3082000
lead|88488004
to problems|55607006
with handwriting,
which
may
be
due to
either
ideational|89090003
or
ideo-motor difficulties.|371157007

Problems|55607006
associated|47429007
with this area|42798000
may
include|55919000
:

Fine-motor problems|3082000|55607006
can
also
cause|23981006|134198009
difficulty|371157007
with a wide variety|90522003
of other tasks|74964007
such as
using|260676000
a knife|17472008
and
fork,|303513001
fastening|228259007|427430009
buttons|14339000
and
shoelaces,
cooking|106373003
,
brushing|263693004
one's teeth,|421379005|38199008
applying|410618006|417924000
cosmetics,|81024003
styling one's hair,|421379005|386045008|421379005|119326000
opening|56116003
jars
and
packets,|419888008
locking
and
unlocking doors,|224751004
shaving|129322004
,
and
doing
housework.[14]|129014002

Issues|55607006
with gross motor coordination mean|255344003|85352007|255586005
that major developmental targets|255603008|278923009
including|55919000
walking,|129006008
running|418060005
,
climbing|284097000
and
jumping|9251003
can
be
affected.|247591002|248448006

The difficulties|371157007
vary
from child|410601007|160499008
to child|410601007|160499008
and
can
include|55919000
the following|255260001
:

In addition|260364009
to the physical impairments,
dyspraxia|6950007
is
associated|47429007
with problems|55607006
with memory,|303116000|106136008
especially short-term memory.|69262000

This typically
results|394617004
in difficulty remembering instructions,|371157007|409073007
difficulty organizing one's time|371157007|385650005|421379005|410669006
and
remembering deadlines,
increased propensity to|35105006|260366006
lose
things
or
problems|55607006
carrying|288345009
out tasks|255529000
which
require
remembering
several steps|261028005|398298007
in sequence|72633008
(
such as cooking|106373003
).

Whilst
most
of the general population|60132005|385436007|60132005|389109008
experience
these problems|55607006
to some extent,|255590007
they
have
a much more significant impact|371925005|134293005
on the lives|224130005
of dyspraxic people.|125676002

However,
many dyspraxics
have
excellent long-term memories,|425405005|247586003
despite
poor short-term memory.|247592009

Many dyspraxics|260396001
benefit
from working|261041009
in a structured environment,|276339004
[20]
as
repeating|27582007
the same routine minimises difficulty|262126009|50811001|371157007
with time-management|410669006|413454004|410669006|119270007
and
allows
them to
commit
procedures|71388002
to long-term memory.|247586003

People|125676002
with dyspraxia|6950007
may
have
sensory processing disorder,|85972008|415178003
including|55919000
abnormal oversensitivity|263654008
or
undersensitivity
to physical stimuli,|5880005|8927009|19388002|8927009
such as touch,|386476006|52962008|397624008
light,|56242006|371268001
sound,|68325009
and
smell.|397686008

This
may
manifest|250255003
itself
as
an inability to
tolerate
certain textures|17162000|246200002
such as sandpaper
or
certain fabrics|17162000|256245006
and
including|55919000
oral toleration|260548002|228432001|260548002|77472006|260548002|71412006
of excessively textured food|260378005|246200002|255620007
(commonly
known|36692007
as picky eating|48263008
)
,
or
even
being
touched|386476006|52962008|397624008
by another individual|125676002|385435006
(
in the case|398241000
of touch oversensitivity|386476006|52962008|397624008
)
or
may
require
the consistent use|385433004|277889008|385433004|419385000
of sunglasses outdoors|420299007
since
sunlight|49926000
may
be
intense enough to|103370009
cause|23981006|134198009
discomfort|367391008|87128005
to a dyspraxic
(
in the case|398241000
of light oversensitivity|56242006|371268001
).

An aversion|35991009
to loud music|24547000
and
naturally loud environments|24547000|276339004
(
such as clubs|42974001
and
bars|428003006
)
is
typical behavior|844005
of a dyspraxic individual|125676002|385435006
who
suffers
from auditory oversensitivity,|255328007
while
only
being
comfortable
in unusually
warm
or
cold environments|285123000
is
typical
of a dyspraxic
with temperature oversensitivity.|105723007|246508008

Undersensitivity
to stimuli|8927009
may
also
cause|23981006|134198009
problems.|55607006

Dyspraxics
who
are
undersensitive
to pain|22253000
may
injure
themselves
without realising.

Some dyspraxics
may
be
oversensitive
to some stimuli|8927009
and
undersensitive
to others.|74964007

These
are
commonly
associated|47429007
with autism spectrum conditions.|408856003|260905004

People|125676002
with dyspraxia sometimes|6950007
have
difficulty|371157007
moderating|6736007
the amount|107651007
of sensory information|262139008
that
their body|279495008|123037004
is
constantly
sending
them,
so
as
a
result|394617004
these people|125676002
are
prone|1240000
to panic attacks.|225624000

Having
other autistic traits|74964007|408856003
(
which
is
common|72906007
with dyspraxia|6950007
and
related conditions|272151006|260905004|262094002|260905004
)
[18]
may
also
contribute
to sensory-induced panic attacks.|262139008|16404004|225624000

Dyspraxia|6950007
can
cause|23981006|134198009
problems|55607006
with perception|81742003
of distance,|246132006
and
with the speed
of moving objects|260787004
and
people[15]|125676002
This
can
cause|23981006|134198009
problems|55607006
moving
in crowded places|257557008
and
crossing roads|65145006|272510001
and
can
make
learning|69998004
to
drive|247750002
a car|71783008
extremely difficult|52925006
or
impossible.

Many dyspraxics|260396001
struggle
to
distinguish
left|7771000
from right,|24028007
even
as adults,|133936004
and
have
extremely poor sense|11403006|106148006|255351007|106148006
of direction generally.[14]|260672003

Moderate|6736007
to extreme difficulty|12565001|371157007
doing
physical tasks|5880005|19388002
is
experienced
by some dyspraxics,
and
fatigue|84229001
is
common|72906007
because
so
much extra energy|248272003
is
expended
while
trying
to execute physical movements correctly.|5880005|255324009|19388002|255324009

Some
(
but
not
all
)
dyspraxics
suffer
from hypotonia,|398152000
which
in this case|398241000
is
chronically low muscle tone|398152000
caused|23981006|134198009
by dyspraxia.|6950007

People|125676002
with this condition|260905004
can
have
very low muscle strength|260362008|91727004|260404005
and
endurance|406203001
(even
in comparison
with other dyspraxics|74964007
)
and
even
the simplest physical activities|13673007|48761009
may
quickly
cause|23981006|134198009
soreness|247348008
and
fatigue,|84229001
depending
on the severity|272141005
of the hypotonia.|398152000

Hypotonia|398152000
may
worsen|230993007|390772001
a dyspraxic's already poor balance.[21]|249985001

Dyspraxics
may
have
other difficulties|74964007|371157007
that
are
not
due to dyspraxia|6950007
itself
but
often|70232002
co-exist
with it.

This
is
sometimes
referred|439980006
to
as
comorbidity.

Dyspraxics
may
have
characteristics
of dyslexia|59770006
(difficulty|371157007
with reading|50360004
and
spelling
)
,
dyscalculia|47916000
(difficulty|371157007
with mathematics
)
,
dysgraphia|88278002
(
an inability
to write neatly|12261009
and/or
draw
)
,
autism spectrum disorder[23]|35919005|264657009
or
ADHD|406506008
(poor attention span|11403006|6769007|255351007|6769007
and
impulsive behaviour|286756000|844005
).

However,
they
are
unlikely to
have
problems|55607006
in all
of these areas.|42798000

The pattern|272135003
of difficulty|371157007
varies
widely
from person|125676002
to person,|125676002
and
it
is
important to
understand|66216009
that
a major weakness|255603008|13791008|255603008|255603008|260407003
for one dyspraxic|421379005
can
be
a strength|260404005
or
gift|221668007
for another.

For example,
while
some dyspraxics
have
difficulty|371157007
with reading|50360004
and
spelling
due to an overlap|24846002
with dyslexia,|59770006
or
numeracy
due to an overlap|24846002
with dyscalculia,|47916000
others|74964007
may
have
brilliant reading|50360004
and
spelling
or
mathematical abilities.|371150009

Some estimates|414135002
show
that
up to 50%
of dyspraxics
have
ADHD.[2]|406506008

Students|65853000
with dyspraxia|6950007
struggle
most
in visual-spatial memory.|283917007

When
compared
to their peers
who
don?t
have
motor difficulties,|371157007
students|65853000
with dyspraxia|6950007
are
seven|420359007
times more likely|242762006|2931005

achieve
very poor scores|260358002|11403006|278061009|260358002|255351007|278061009
in visual-spatial memory.|283917007

As a result|394617004
of this working memory impairment,|69262000|40226000|261041009|386807006
students|65853000
with dyspraxia|6950007
have
learning deficits|69998004|260372006
as well.[25]|20572008

Some students|65853000
with dyspraxia|6950007
can
also
have
comorbid Specific Language Impairment (SLI).|229746007

Research
has
found|404684003
that students|65853000
with dyspraxia|6950007
and
normal language skills still|17621005|61909002|258744000|61909002
experience
learning difficulties|161129001
despite relative strengths|125677006|260404005|29920004|260404005
in language.|61909002

This means|255586005
that
for students|65853000
with dyspraxia|6950007
their working memory abilities|69262000|371150009
determine
their learning difficulties.|161129001

Any strength|260404005
in language|61909002
that
they
have
is
not able to sufficiently|371150009
support|9096001|243114000
their learning.[26]|69998004
