an infection
of the bile duct|28273000|276157007
(cholangitis|82403002
)
,
usually
caused|23981006|134198009
by bacteria ascending|409822003|79458005
from its junction|50974003
with the duodenum|263989007|181247007

of the small intestine.|264196002|181250005

It
tends
to
occur|272120004
if
the bile duct|28273000|276157007
is
already partially
obstructed|263821009
by gallstones.[1][2]|266474003|256896000|235919008

Cholangitis|82403002
can
be
life-threatening,|224130005
and
is
regarded
as a medical emergency.|74188005|25876001

Characteristic symptoms
include|55919000
jaundice,|18165001
fever,|386661006
abdominal pain,|21522001
and
in severe cases,|24484000|398241000|24484000|413769002
low blood pressure|45007003
and
confusion.|286933003

is
with intravenous fluids|118431008
and
antibiotics,|255631004
but
there
is
often|70232002
an underlying problem|55607006
(
such as gallstones|266474003|256896000|235919008
or
narrowing|25659002|134223000
in the bile duct|28273000|276157007
)
for which further|46053002
tests|269814003|272393004
and
treatments|276239002
may
be
necessary, usually
in the form|246176004
of endoscopy to|423827005
relieve|397855004
obstruction|26036001
of the bile duct.[1][3]|28273000|276157007

A person|125676002
with cholangitis|82403002
may
complain
of abdominal pain|21522001
(particularly
in the right upper quadrant|255497008
of the abdomen,|277112006|52731004|302553009
fever,|386661006
rigors|248457000
(uncontrollable shaking|26079004
)
and
a feeling|285854004
of uneasiness
(malaise.|367391008

Some
may
report|229059009|223458004
jaundice|18165001
(yellow discoloration|263935005|47415006
of the skin|119325001|39937001|181469002

Physical examination findings typically|72670004|5880005|5880005|271906008|19388002|271906008
include|55919000
jaundice|18165001
and
right upper quadrant tenderness.|255497008|247348008

Charcot's triad
is
a set
of three common findings|421291004|72906007|404684003|421291004|72906007
in cholangitis|82403002
:
abdominal pain,|21522001
jaundice,|18165001
and
fever.|386661006

This
was
assumed
in the past to|410513005
be
present|52101004|246105001
in 50?70%
of cases,|398241000|413769002
although
more recently|242762006|6493001
the frequency|260864003|272123002
has
been
reported|229059009|223458004
as 15?20%.

Reynolds
' pentad
includes|55919000
the findings|404684003
of Charcot's triad
with the presence|386397008
of septic shock|76571007
and
mental confusion.|286933003

This combination|89780004
of symptoms
indicates|410535002
worsening|230993007|231877006
of the condition|260905004
and
the development|278923009
of sepsis,|105592009|91302008
and
is
seen less commonly still.[1][2]

In the elderly,|105436006
the presentation|246105001
may
be
atypical|112231000
;
they
may
directly
collapse|27942005|16277007|271787007
due to septicemia|105592009

Those with an indwelling stent|20401003|255307003|65818007|421463005|255307003|65818007
in the bile duct|28273000|276157007

may
not
develop

Bile duct obstruction,|33688009
which
is
usually
present|52101004|246105001
in acute cholangitis,|6215006
is
generally
due to gallstones.|266474003|256896000|235919008

10?30%
of cases,|398241000|413769002
however,
are
due to other causes|74964007|134198009
such as benign stricturing|30807003|27551008
(narrowing|25659002|134223000
of the bile duct|28273000|276157007
without an underlying tumor|108369006
)
,
postoperative damage|262061000|37782003
or
an altered structure
of the bile ducts|28273000
such as narrowing|25659002|134223000
at the site|10546003
of an anastomosis|41796003|257741005
(surgical connection|83578000|263538003
)
and
various tumors|256220008|108369006
(cancer|363346000|372087000
of the bile duct,|28273000|276157007
gallbladder cancer,|363353009|372140005
cancer|363346000|372087000
of the ampulla of Vater,|67109009

or
cancer|363346000|372087000
of the duodenum.|263989007|181247007

Cholangitis|82403002
may
also
complicate|255302009
medical procedures|50731006
involving|248448006
the bile duct,|28273000|276157007
especially ERCP.|386718000

To
prevent
this,
it
is
recommended
that
those undergoing ERCP|386718000
for any indication|410666004
receive
prophylactic|322837006|262073000
(preventative
)
antibiotics.[3]|255631004

The presence|386397008
of a permanent biliary stent|6934004|360123005
(e.g.|258795003

in pancreatic cancer|372142002|363418001
)
slightly|425404009
increases|260366006
the risk|30207005
of cholangitis,|82403002
but
stents|65818007
of this type|261664005
are
often|70232002
needed to|410525008|103325001
keep
the bile duct patent|28273000|56116003|276157007|56116003
under
outside pressure.[1]|279046003|13543005|257893003

Routine blood tests|50811001|252275004
show
features
of acute inflammation|4532008
(raised white blood cell count|260399008|767002|260399008|365630000
and
elevated C-reactive protein level|75540009|55235003
)
,
and
usually abnormal liver function tests (LFTs).|166603001

In most cases|398241000|413769002
the LFTs|26958001
will
be
consistent|385433004
with obstruction|26036001
:
raised bilirubin,|26165005
alkaline phosphatase|57056007|406971006
and ?-glutamyl transpeptidase.|60153001

In the early stages,|264499004|261612004
however,
pressure|279046003|13543005|257893003
on the liver cells|30396005
may
be
the main feature|63161005
and
the tests|269814003|272393004
will
resemble
those
in hepatitis,|128241005|40468003|396423004
with elevations|255456001
in alanine transaminase|56935002
and
aspartate transaminase.[1]|26091008

Blood cultures|30088009
are
often|70232002
performed|398166005
in people|125676002
with fever|386661006
and
evidence|18669006
of acute infection.|63171007

These
yield
the bacteria|409822003
causing|23981006
the infection
in 36%
of cases,|398241000|413769002
[7] usually
after 24?48 hours|123027009|259029002
of incubation.

Bile,|70150004
too,
may
be
sent
for culture|252398009|61594008
during ERCP|386718000
(
see|281004000
below
).

The most common bacteria|4757001|72906007|409822003
linked
to ascending cholangitis|26918003
are
gram-negative bacilli|87172008
:
_Escherichia coli_|112283007
(25?50%
)
,
Klebsiella|75032006
(15?20%
)
and
Enterobacter|58683007
(5?10%|264706000|264605009
).

Of the gram-positive cocci,|59206002
Enterococcus|2785000
causes|134198009
10?20%.

A small proportion|255507004|8212001
of cases,|398241000|413769002
especially
in the elderly|105436006
and
those who
have
undergone
previous surgery|9130008|83578000
of the biliary system,|34707002|361354009
is
due to anaerobic organisms|410653004
such as Clostridium|8191000
and
Bacteroides.|57522007

In the developing world,
cholangitis|82403002
may
also
be
caused|23981006|134198009
by parasites|37763007
such as _Ascaris lumbricoides_|19061001
and
_Clonorchis sinensis_.|36559008

In people|125676002
with AIDS,|62479008
a large number|255509001|410680006|255509001|410681005
of opportunistic organisms|410653004
has
been
known|36692007
to
cause|23981006|134198009
_AIDS cholangiopathy_,|62479008
but
the risk|30207005
has
rapidly|418694008
diminished|1250004
since
the introduction|107733003
of effective AIDS treatment.[1]|255403003|62479008|276239002|255403003|62479008|416118004|254648000|62479008|276239002|254648000|62479008|416118004

Given|419582001
that ascending cholangitis usually|26918003
occurs|272120004
in the setting
of bile duct obstruction,|33688009
various forms|256220008|246176004
of medical imaging|278395004
may
be
employed|224363007
to
identify|7882003
the site|10546003
and
nature|277302009
of this obstruction.|26036001

The first investigation|255216001|386053000|232714002|386053000
is
usually ultrasound,|359659005
as
this
is
the most easily available.|4757001|36203004|103328004

Ultrasound|359659005
may
show
dilation|25322007|71025006|363105001
of the bile duct|28273000|276157007
and
identifies|7882003
38%|264670000
of bile duct stones|30093007
;
it
is
relatively poor|11403006|255351007
at identifying stones further|7882003|384600008|46053002
down the bile duct.|28273000|276157007

Ultrasound|359659005
can
help
distinguish
between cholangitis|82403002
and
cholecystitis|76581006
(inflammation|257552002
of the gallbladder|28231008|181269000
)
,
which
has
similar symptoms
to cholangitis|82403002
but
appears
differently
on ultrasound.|359659005

A better test|3442003|269814003|3442003|3442003|272393004
is
magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP),|314635004
which
uses|277889008|394850002|260676000|419385000
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)|113091000
;
this
has
a comparable sensitivity|35209006|365705006
to ERCP.|386718000

Smaller stones,|263796003|384600008|255507004|384600008
however,
can
still
be
missed
on MRCP
depending
on the quality|263496004
of the hospital's facilities.[1]|285201006

The gold standard|2309006|371256005
(best possible|20572008|371930009|20572008|60022001|3442003|371930009|3442003|60022001
)
test|269814003|272393004
for biliary obstruction|235918000
is
still endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP).|386718000

This
involves|248448006
the use|277889008|419385000
of endoscopy|423827005
(
passing
a tube|83059008
through the mouth|74262004|123851003|21082005|181220002
into the esophagus,|32849002|181245004
stomach|69695003|181246003
and
thence
to the duodenum to|263989007|181247007
pass
a small cannula|255507004|12150006
into the bile duct.|28273000|276157007

At
that point,
radiocontrast
is
injected to|422145002
opacify
the duct,|343011009|91726008
and
X-rays|52250000|168537006
are
taken|419652001
to
get
a visual impression|255374006|286781002
of the biliary system.|34707002|361354009

On the endoscopic image|423827005
of the ampulla,
one|421379005
can
sometimes
see|281004000
a protuberant ampulla
from an impacted gallstone|134293005|266474003|134293005|256896000
in the common bile duct,|79741001
or
the frank extrusion|263751005
of pus|11311000|119323008
from the common bile duct orifice.|79741001|264114003

On the X-ray images|52250000|168537006|363680008
(
known|36692007
as cholangiograms,|28367004
gallstones|266474003|256896000|235919008
are
visible|24054004
as nonopacified areas|42798000
in the contour
of the duct.|343011009|91726008

For diagnostic purposes,|439401001|363675004|261004008|363675004
ERCP|386718000
has
now generally
been
replaced|282089006|370124000
by MRCP.

ERCP|386718000
is
only
used first-line|394850002|255216001|50009006|394850002|232714002|50009006
in critically ill patients|367391008|116154003
in whom
delay
for diagnostic tests|103693007
is
not acceptable
;
however,
if
the index|419205000
of suspicion|22927000
for cholangitis|82403002
is
high,|75540009|371879000
an ERCP|386718000
is
typically
done
to
achieve
drainage|307488001|122462000
of the obstructed common bile duct.[1]|263821009|79741001

If other causes|74964007|134198009
rather than
gallstones|266474003|256896000|235919008
are
suspected|415684004
(
such as a tumor,|108369006
computed tomography|77477000
and
endoscopic ultrasound (EUS)|423827005|359659005|359659005
may
be
performed|398166005
to
identify|7882003
the nature|277302009
of the obstruction.|26036001

EUS
may
be
used|394850002

Bile|70150004
is
produced
by the liver,|10200004|181268008
and
serves
to
eliminate
cholesterol|84698008|412808005
and
bilirubin|79706000
from the body,|279495008|123037004

in the gall bladder|28231008|181269000
because of back pressure|123961009|279046003|123961009|13543005|123961009|257893003|255551008|279046003|255551008|13543005|255551008|257893003|281213008|279046003|281213008|13543005|281213008|257893003|302552004|279046003|302552004|13543005|302552004|257893003|77568009|279046003|77568009|13543005|77568009|257893003
(
exerted|19487008
by the sphincter of Oddi,|51807001|181271000
and
may
be
released|68776005|129299003
at time|410669006
of digestion.|106079008

The gall bladder also|28231008|181269000
concentrates
the bile|70150004
by absorbing water|11713004|119318008
and
dissolved salts|421682005|387390002
from it.

All bile|70150004
reaches|282679008
the duodenum|263989007|181247007
(first part|255216001|260726005|232714002|260726005
of the small intestine|264196002|181250005
)
through the common bile duct|79741001
and
the ampulla of Vater.|67109009

The sphincter of Oddi,|51807001|181271000
located
at the junction|50974003
of the ampulla of Vater|67109009
and
the duodenum,|263989007|181247007
is
a circular muscle|354652004|91727004
that
controls|54776003|31509003
the release|58000006|68776005|258760001|129299003|115956009
of
both
bile|70150004
and
pancreatic secretions|13226008
into the digestive tract.[1]|122865005

The biliary tree|34707002
is
normally relatively free|37837009
of bacteria|409822003
because of certain protective mechanisms.|17162000|257544000

The sphincter of Oddi acts|51807001|181271000
as a mechanical barrier.|261018001

The biliary system normally|34707002|361354009
has
low pressure|62482003|279046003|62482003|13543005|62482003|257893003|371880002|279046003|371880002|13543005|371880002|257893003
(8
to 12 cmH2O[9]|259019009
and
allows
bile|70150004
to flow freely
through.

The continuous forward flow|255238004|255540008
of the bile|70150004
in the duct|343011009|91726008
flushes|20255002|271811009
bacteria,|409822003
if
present,|52101004|246105001
into the duodenum,|263989007|181247007
and
does
not
allow
establishment
of an infection.

The constitution
of bile?bile salts[1]|312291001|104552002
and
immunoglobulin[2]|112133008|42441008
secreted
by the epithelium|31610004
of the bile duct also|28273000|276157007
has
a protective role.

Bacterial contamination|409822003
alone|105529008
in absence|2667000|418560003
of obstruction|26036001
does
not usually
result|394617004
in cholangitis.|82403002

However increased pressure|51590001
within the biliary system|34707002|361354009
(
above 20 cmH2O|259019009
)
[10]
resulting|42752001
from obstruction|26036001
in the bile duct widens|28273000|90522003|276157007|90522003
spaces
between the cells|4421005
lining|50009006
the duct,|343011009|91726008
bringing|68369002
bacterially contaminated bile|62604006|70150004
in contact|52101004|11723008|52101004|70862002|18720000|11723008|18720000|70862002
with the blood stream.|87612001|257709004|119273009|257709004

It also adversely
affects|4065008
the function|246464006
of Kupffer cells,|256002
which
are
specialized|67995009
macrophage cells|58986001|4421005
that
assist|116697009|119265000
in preventing bacteria|409822003|116699007|409822003
from entering|417985001
the biliary system.|34707002|361354009

Finally,
increased|35105006|260366006
biliary pressure|70150004|279046003|70150004|13543005|70150004|257893003
decreases|260370003
production
of IgA immunoglobulins|112133008|42441008
in the bile.|70150004

This results|394617004
in bacteremia|5758002
(bacteria|409822003
in the blood stream|87612001|257709004|119273009|257709004
)
and
gives|419582001
rise
to the systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) comprising fever|238150007|386661006
(often|70232002
with rigors|248457000
)
,
tachycardia,|3424008|6285003
increased|35105006|260366006
respiratory rate|86290005
and
increased white blood cell count|35105006|767002|35105006|365630000|260366006|767002|260366006|365630000
;
SIRS|238150007
in the presence|386397008
of suspected|415684004
or
confirmed infection|59156000
is
called sepsis.|105592009|91302008

Biliary obstruction|235918000
itself
disadvantages
the immune system|116003000
and
impairs|260379002|40226000
its capability
to fight infection,|248005005
by impairing|260379002
the function|246464006
of certain immune system cells|17162000|116003000|4421005
(neutrophil granulocytes|116712007
and
modifying|243326001
the levels|258395000
of immune hormones|255386009|87568004
(cytokines.[1]|75777003

In ascending cholangitis,|26918003
it
is
assumed
that organisms|410653004
migrate
backwards|255539006
up the bile duct|28273000|276157007
as a result|394617004
of partial obstruction|13705009
and
decreased function|1250004|246464006|260400001|246464006|260371004|246464006
of the sphincter of Oddi.|51807001|181271000

Other theories|74964007
about the origin|255395001
of the bacteria,|409822003
such as
through the portal vein|32764006|74680004|286195007|362064007
or
transmigration
from the colon,|263977005|302508007
are
considered
less likely.[1]|276139006|2931005|263796003|2931005

Cholangitis|82403002
requires
admission|32485007
to hospital.|285201006

Intravenous fluids|118431008
are
administered|418283001
,
especially
if
the blood pressure|75367002|392570002|386536003
is
low,|62482003|371880002
and
antibiotics|255631004
are
commenced.

Empirical treatment|276239002|416118004
with broad-spectrum antibiotics|90522003|255631004
is
usually necessary
until
it
is
known|36692007
for certain|17162000
which pathogen|264418008
is
causing|23981006
the infection,
and
to which antibiotics|255631004
it
is
sensitive.|83185005

Combinations|228166004
of penicillins|373270004
and
aminoglycosides|324116004|14443002
are
widely
used|394850002
,
although
ciprofloxacin|392412000
has
been
shown
to
be
effective|255403003|254648000
in most cases,|398241000|413769002
and
may
be
preferred|225773000
to aminoglycosides|324116004|14443002
because of fewer side effects.|57176003

Metronidazole|372602008
is
often|70232002
added to specifically
treat|395077000
the anaerobic pathogens,|264418008
especially
in those
who
are
very ill|260358002|367391008
or
at risk|410519009
of anaerobic infections.

Antibiotics|255631004
are
continued|255238004
for 7?10 days.|258703001

Drugs|410942007
that
increase|260366006
the blood pressure|75367002|392570002|386536003
(vasopressors|372881000
may
also
be
required
to counter|303502004
the low blood pressure.[2]|45007003

The definitive treatment|261002007|276239002|261002007|416118004
for cholangitis|82403002
is
relief|224978009
of the underlying biliary obstruction.|235918000

This
is
usually
deferred
until 24?48 hours|123027009|259029002
after admission,|32485007
when
the patient|116154003
is
stable|58158008
and
has
shown
some improvement
with antibiotics,|255631004
but
may
need|410525008|103325001
to
happen
as an emergency|25876001
in case|398241000
of ongoing deterioration|255238004
despite adequate treatment,|51117008|276239002|51117008|416118004|88323005|276239002|88323005|416118004
[1]|260305007
or
if antibiotics|255631004
are
not effective|255403003|254648000
in reducing|260400001
the signs|72670004
of infection
(
which happens
in 15%
of cases|398241000|413769002
).[2][3]|260306008

Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP)|386718000
is
the most common approach|4757001|72906007
in unblocking
the bile duct.|28273000|276157007

This
involves|248448006
endoscopy|423827005
(
passing
a fiberoptic tube|83059008
through the stomach|69695003|181246003
into the duodenum|263989007|181247007
)
,
identification|286672002|7882003
of the ampulla of Vater|67109009
and
insertion|71861002|257867005
of a small tube|255507004|83059008
into the bile duct.|28273000|276157007

A sphincterotomy
(
making
a cut|283396008
in the sphincter of Oddi|51807001|181271000
)
is
typically
done
to
ease
the flow
of bile|70150004
from the duct|343011009|91726008
and
to
allow
insertion|71861002|257867005
of instruments to|57134006
extract|62972009
gallstones|266474003|256896000|235919008
that
are
obstructing|263821009
the common bile duct|79741001
;
alternatively
or
additionally,
the common bile duct orifice|79741001|264114003
can
be
dilated|255381004
with a balloon.|47006006|34263000

Stones|384600008
may
be
removed|127485006
either
by direct suction|255589003|274441001
or
by
using|260676000
various instruments,|256220008|57134006
including|55919000
balloons|47006006|34263000
and
baskets to
trawl
the bile duct|28273000|276157007
in order
to pull stones|303370007|384600008
into the duodenum.|263989007|181247007

Obstructions|26036001
that
are
caused|23981006|134198009
by larger stones|255509001|384600008|263768009|384600008
may
require
the use|277889008|419385000
of an instrument|57134006
known|36692007
as a mechanical lithotriptor|261018001|6972009
in order to
crush|60726007
the stone|384600008
prior to removal.|118292001|128303001

Obstructing stones|263821009|384600008
that
are
too large to|255509001
be
removed|127485006
or
broken mechanically
by ERCP|386718000
may
be
managed|119270007
by extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy.|44345001

This technique|272394005
uses|277889008|394850002|260676000|419385000
acoustic shock waves|27942005
administered|418283001
outside the body to break down|279495008|263690001|123037004|263690001
the stones.|384600008

An alternative technique to|272394005
remove|127485006
very large obstructing stones|258262008|263821009|384600008
is
electrohydraulic lithotripsy,|446125000
where
a small endoscope|255507004|37270008
known|36692007
as a cholangioscope
is
inserted|257867005
by ERCP|386718000
to directly
visualize|255374006
the stone.|384600008

A probe|7402007
uses|277889008|394850002|260676000|419385000
electricity to|18213006
generate
shock waves|27942005
that break down|263690001
the obstructing stone.|263821009|384600008

Rarely,|103356009
surgical exploration|76145000
of the common bile duct|79741001
(termed choledochotomy|294034007
)
,
which
can
be
performed|398166005
with laparoscopy,|108191006
is
required to
remove|127485006
the stone.[16]|384600008

Narrowed|134223000
areas|42798000
may
be
bridged|277035007
by a stent,|65818007
a hollow tube|255347005|83059008
that
keeps
the duct|343011009|91726008
open.|56116003

Removable plastic stents|257362008
are
used|394850002
in uncomplicated gallstone disease,|263914008|266474003
while
permanent|6934004
self-expanding|70955005
metal stents|257363003
with a longer lifespan|255511005
are
used|394850002
if
the obstruction|26036001
is
due to pressure|279046003|13543005|257893003
from a tumor|108369006
such as pancreatic cancer.|372142002|363418001

A nasobiliary drain|32712000
may
be
left|7771000
behind
;
this
is
a plastic tube|34234003
that passes
from the bile duct|28273000|276157007
through the stomach|69695003|181246003
and
the nose|260540009|181195007
and
allows
continuous drainage|255238004|307488001|255238004|122462000
of bile|70150004
into a receptible.

It
is
similar
to a nasogastric tube,|17102003
but
passes
into the common bile duct directly,|79741001
and
allows
for serial x-ray|52250000|168537006|363680008
cholangiograms|28367004
to
be
done
to
identify|7882003
the improvement
of the obstruction.|26036001

The decision
on which
of the aforementioned treatments to|276239002
apply|410618006|417924000
is
generally
based|418836005
on the severity|272141005
of the obstruction,|26036001
findings|404684003
on other imaging studies,|74964007|363679005|110465008|74964007|363679005|224699009|74964007|278395004|110465008|74964007|278395004|224699009
and
whether
the patient|116154003
has
improved|385425000|3442003
with antibiotic treatment.|255631004|276239002|255631004|416118004

Certain treatments|17162000|276239002
may
be
unsafe
if blood clotting|75753009
is
impaired,|260379002|40226000
as
the risk|30207005
of bleeding|131148009
(especially
from sphincterotomy
)
is
increased|35105006|260366006
in the use|277889008|419385000
of medication|410942007
such as clopidogrel|386952008
(
which
inhibits|61511001
platelet aggregation|60649002
)
or
if
the prothrombin time|396451008
is
significantly
prolonged.|255224006

For a prolonged prothrombin time,|409674002
vitamin K|65183007
or
fresh frozen plasma|346447007
may
be
administered|418283001
to
reduce|260400001
bleeding risk.[1]|131148009|30207005

It
may

with the duodenum|263989007|181247007
or
jejunum.|261103000|181248002

When
this happens,
percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography (PTC)|16747000
may
be
needed|410525008|103325001
to
relieve|397855004
pressure.|279046003|13543005|257893003

This
involves|248448006
identifying|7882003
the bile duct|28273000|276157007
by ultrasound|359659005
and
then
passing
a tube|83059008
through the skin|119325001|39937001|181469002
(percutaneous|103388001
).

PTC
is
generally
performed|398166005
by radiologists.|66862007

PTC
has
potential complications,|30207005|116223007
so
occasionally further|46053002
attempts
at ERCP|386718000
by more experienced doctors|242762006|309343006
are
preferred.[1]|225773000

Continual contamination|263730007
of bile duct|28273000|276157007
by indwelling stents|255307003|65818007
(
as
may
occur|272120004
in chronic conditions|90734009|260905004
like tumor|108369006
of the head|69536005|302548004
of pancreas|15776009|181277001

monitoring|302805002
by repeated radiologic tests|27582007|394914008|269814003|27582007|394914008|272393004|27582007|5526005|269814003|27582007|5526005|272393004
and
changing|243326001|263703002
of the stents.[2]|65818007

Not
all gallstones|266474003|256896000|235919008
implicated
in ascending cholangitis actually|26918003
originate
from the gallbladder,|28231008|181269000
but
cholecystectomy|38102005
(surgical removal|118292001|128303001|128304007
of the gallbladder|28231008|181269000
)
is
generally
recommended
in people|125676002
who
have
been
treated|28995006
for cholangitis|82403002
due to gallstone disease.|266474003

This
is
typically
delayed
until all symptoms
have
resolved
and
ERCP|386718000
or
MRCP
have
confirmed|59156000
that
the bile duct|28273000|276157007
is
clear|263707001
of gallstones.|266474003|256896000|235919008

Those
who
do
not
undergo
cholecystectomy|38102005
have
an increased risk|35105006|30207005|260366006|30207005
of recurrent biliary pain,|255227004|37389005
jaundice,|18165001
further episodes|46053002|272128006
of cholangitis,|82403002
and
need|410525008|103325001
for further ERCP|46053002|386718000
or
related procedures|272151006|71388002|262094002|71388002
;
the risk|30207005
of death|419620001|268923008
is
also significantly
increased.[17]|35105006|260366006

Acute cholangitis|6215006
carries|288345009
a significant risk|386134007|30207005
of death,|419620001|268923008
the leading cause|236874000|134198009
being
irreversible shock|276227005
with multiple organ failure|57653000
(
a possible complication|371930009|116223007|371930009|263718001|60022001|116223007|60022001|263718001
of severe infections|24484000
).

Improvements
in diagnosis|439401001
and
treatment|276239002|416118004
have
led|88488004|236874000
to a reduction|58294000|260400001|289928003
in mortality|409651001
:
before 1980,|236874000|421718005
the mortality rate|409651001
was
greater|263768009
than 50%,
but
after 1980
it
was
10?30%.

Patients|116154003
with signs|72670004
of multiple organ failure|57653000
are
likely to|2931005
die|419620001|399069006|419099009
unless
they
undergo
early biliary drainage|264499004|235566000
and
treatment|276239002|416118004
with systemic antibiotics.|31099001|255631004

Other causes|74964007|134198009
of death|419620001|268923008
following|255260001
severe cholangitis|24484000|82403002
include|55919000
heart failure|84114007|42343007
and
pneumonia.[18]|205237003

Risk factors|80943009

an increased risk|35105006|30207005|260366006|30207005
of death|419620001|268923008
include|55919000
older age,|105436006|32864002

include|55919000
renal failure,|42399005

to heart attacks.[18]|22298006

In the Western world,
about 15%
of all people|125676002
have
gallstones|266474003|256896000|235919008
in their gallbladder|28231008|181269000
but
the majority
are
unaware|418107008|406124004
of this
and
have
no symptoms.

Over ten years,|23067006|258707000|420258001|258707000
15?26%
will
suffer
one|421379005
or
more episodes|242762006|272128006
of biliary colic|37389005
(abdominal pain|21522001
due to the passage|255592004
of gallstones|266474003|256896000|235919008
through the bile duct|28273000|276157007
into the digestive tract|122865005
)
,
and
2?3%|260306008
will
develop
complications|116223007
of obstruction|26036001
:
acute pancreatitis,|197456007
cholecystitis|76581006
or
acute cholangitis.|6215006

Prevalence
of gallstone disease|266474003
increases|260366006
with age|424144002
and
body mass index|60621009
(
a marker
of obesity.|414915002

However,
risk|30207005
is
also
increased|35105006|260366006
in those
who
lose
weight rapidly|27113001|418694008|272102008|418694008|39857003|418694008
(e.g.|258795003

after weight loss surgery|89362005|83578000
due to alterations
in the composition
of the bile|70150004
that
makes
it prone to|1240000
form|246176004
stones.|384600008

Gallstones|266474003|256896000|235919008
are
slightly more common|425404009|72906007
in women|224526002
than
in men,|339947000
and
pregnancy|289908002
increases|260366006
the risk further.[20]|30207005|46053002

Dr Jean-Martin Charcot,|309343006|228210008
working|261041009
at the Salp?tri?re Hospital|404882002|228877007|404882002|228877007|285201006
in Paris,|7074004
France,|223666001
is
credited
with early reports|264499004|229059009|264499004|223458004
of cholangitis,|82403002
as well as
his eponymous triad,
in 1877.

He
referred|439980006
to the condition|260905004
as "hepatic fever"|32381004|386661006
(_fi?vre h?patique_|113727004|89177007|113727004|258322007|113727004|286551008
).

Dr Benedict M.|309343006

Reynolds,
an American surgeon,|304292004
reignited
interest|225469004
in the condition|260905004
in his 1959 report|229059009|223458004
with colleague Dr Everett L.|309343006

Dargan,
and
formulated
the pentad
that
carries|288345009
his name.

It
remained
a condition generally|260905004
treated|28995006
by surgeons,|304292004
with exploration|122458006
of the bile duct|28273000|276157007
and
excision|118292001|128303001
of gallstones,|266474003|256896000|235919008
until
the ascendancy
of ERCP|386718000
in 1968.

ERCP|386718000
is
generally
performed|398166005
by internal medicine|419192003
or
gastroenterology specialists.|394584008|309395003

In 1992
it
was
shown
that ERCP|386718000
was
generally safer
than surgical intervention|83578000
in ascending cholangitis.[22]|26918003
