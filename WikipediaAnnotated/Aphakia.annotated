is
the absence|2667000|418560003
of the lens|78076003|181169005
of the eye,|81745001|244486005
due to surgical removal,|118292001|128303001|128304007
a perforating wound|43892002
or
ulcer,|429040005
or
congenital anomaly.|276654001

It
causes|134198009
a loss
of accommodation,|251776000
hyperopia,|38101003
and
a deep anterior chamber.|131197000|31636006

Complications|116223007
include|55919000
detachment
of the vitreous
or
retina,|5665001|181171005
and
glaucoma.|23986001

Aphakic people|125676002
are
reported|229059009|223458004
to
be
able to|371150009
see|281004000
ultraviolet wavelengths|415770004|246522008
(400 nm - 300 nm)
that
are
normally
excluded|77765009
by the lens.|78076003|181169005

They
perceive|81742003
this light|56242006|371268001
as whitish blue|405738005
or
whitish violet.|13944006

This
may
have
had
an effect|253861007
on the colors|263714004
perceived|81742003
by artist Claude Monet,|159062006
who
had
cataract surgery|54885007|422349000|110473004
in 1923.[2]

Babies|418119000
are
rarely|103356009
born|106970005|81827009|398209006
with aphakia.|24010005

Occurrence most often|272120004|70232002
results|394617004
from surgery to|83578000
remove|127485006
congenital cataracts|79410001
(clouding
of the eyes' lens,|78076003
which
can
block|26036001|112232007
light|56242006|371268001
from entering|417985001
the eye|81745001|244486005
and
focusing clearly|251776000
).

Congenital cataracts usually|79410001
develop
as a result|394617004
of infection
of the fetus|83418008
or
genetic reasons.|3950001|410666004|255395001|410666004

It
is
often difficult to|70232002|52925006
identify|7882003
the exact cause|134198009
of these cataracts,|247053007|95722004
especially
if
only one eye|50607009|421379005|81745001|50607009|421379005|244486005|420295001|421379005|81745001|420295001|421379005|244486005
is
affected.|247591002|248448006

People|125676002
with aphakia|24010005
have
relatively small pupils|63251006
and
their pupils|392406005
dilate|255381004
to a lesser degree.[3]|263796003|258395000|263796003|246173007

The eye|81745001|244486005
becomes
highly hypermetropic|75540009|38101003
and
total power|258755000|33300005|255619001|33300005
of eye|81745001|244486005
is
reduced.|260400001

This results|394617004
in a total loss|258755000|255619001
of accommodation.|251776000

This
can
be
corrected|370975003
by wearing glasses,|50121007
contact lenses|57368009
or
by implant|40388003|71861002|64218007
of an artificial lens|313236002
(pseudophakia.|95217000
