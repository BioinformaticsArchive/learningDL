*Splints|16650009|48300006
*

is
an ailment|39104002
of the horse|35354009|388441000|388445009
or
pony,|3997000
characterized
by a hard, bony swelling,|72505002|263686003|423666004|72505002|263686003|442672001
usually
on the inside of a front leg,|260521003|255549009|61685007|260521003|255549009|30021000|260521003|255549009|182281004|260521003|255549009|362793004
lying|40199007|255576009
between the splint|16650009
and
cannon bone|370711008
or
on the splint bone|16650009|272673000|16650009|3138006|16650009|90780006|16650009|128530007
itself.

It
may
be
"hot,"|264018002
meaning|255586005
that
it
occurred recently|272120004|6493001
and
is
still painful|22253000
;
or
"cold,|285686007|82272006|84162001
"
meaning|255586005
that
the splint|16650009
has
completely
recovered|74822006
and
there
is
no longer|255511005
any
swelling|423666004|442672001
or
pain|22253000
associated|47429007
with it.

Bucked shins|72702002
are
sometimes
called
'shin splints,|183202003
'
which
involve|248448006
small stress fractures|255507004|240197007
of the dorsal cannon bone,|255551008|370711008
often|70232002
seen
in race training,|415229000|118629009
and
discussed
elsewhere.

The splint bones,|16650009|272673000|16650009|128530007
(metacarpal|36455000|181977005
or
metatarsal II|53884002|302532000
and
IV
)
,
which
are
remnants
of two|420797005
of the five toes|421820001|29707007
of prehistoric horses,|35354009
run down|418060005|247524003|282476009|247524003
either
side|182353008
of the cannon bone.|370711008

They
narrow|18043004|25659002|134223000
as
they
go
from the carpal|83936004|74670003
or
tarsal joint|27949001|361283005
down,
and
form|246176004
a "button"|14339000
at the bottom|421610009
or
their length,|410668003
a few inches|57176003|258677007
above the fetlock.|48201008

Splint bones|16650009|272673000|16650009|128530007
are
attached|102491009
to the cannon
by the interosseous ligament,|182410007
providing
some mobility|363803005|246197003
in the young horse.|84422007|35354009|84422007|388441000|84422007|388445009

As the horse ages,|35354009|424144002|388441000|424144002|388445009|424144002
the interosseous ligament|182410007
is
typically
replaced|282089006|370124000
by bone.|272673000|3138006|90780006|128530007

In some older horses,|70753007|35354009
the cannon
and
splint bones|16650009|272673000|16650009|128530007
may
become
completely
fused.

*Direct trauma|258136009
*
*,
such as
from an interference injury
or
a kick
from another horse,|35354009|388441000|388445009
is
a common causes|72906007|134198009
of splints.|16650009|48300006

The periosteum|33840008
is
damaged|37782003
by the trauma,
and
the horse's body|35354009|279495008|35354009|123037004|388441000|279495008|388441000|123037004|388445009|279495008|388445009|123037004

down new bone|7147002|272673000|7147002|3138006|7147002|90780006|7147002|128530007
in the injured area.|42798000

Splints|16650009|48300006
caused|23981006|134198009
by trauma
are
more commonly|242762006
seen
lower|261122009
down the leg|61685007|30021000|182281004|362793004
than ones|421379005
caused|23981006|134198009
by strain.|48532005|276768000

The splints|16650009|48300006
may
occur|272120004
in a front leg|255549009|61685007|255549009|30021000|255549009|182281004|255549009|362793004
or
hind,
in one leg|421379005|61685007|421379005|30021000|421379005|182281004|421379005|362793004
or
both.

Severe|24484000
enough trauma
can
fracture|125605004
the splint bone.|16650009|272673000|16650009|3138006|16650009|90780006|16650009|128530007

,
and
in the lower portion,|261122009|260726005
some
heal|298005009
well.|20572008

Others|74964007
may
need|410525008|103325001
surgical removal|118292001|128303001|128304007
of a portion|260726005
of the damaged splint bone.[1]|37782003|16650009|272673000|37782003|16650009|3138006|37782003|16650009|90780006|37782003|16650009|128530007

*
*Concussion|81371004
*
*
is
another cause|134198009
of splints.|16650009|48300006

Concussive forces
run|418060005|282476009
from the carpus|8205005|361289009
or
tarsus|108371006|264228001

a horse|35354009|388441000|388445009
on hard surfaces|72505002|410678000
increases|260366006
the concussion|81371004
received
by the interosseous ligament,|182410007
which
causes|134198009
tearing.|415747007|40431001|312608009|418035005

Splints|16650009|48300006
caused|23981006|134198009
by concussion|81371004
are
usually
found|404684003
on
both
front legs,|255549009|30021000
most commonly
on the inside of the leg|260521003|61685007|260521003|30021000|260521003|182281004|260521003|362793004

at speed
or
in tight circles|255365009|354652004|228187009|354652004
may
cause|23981006|134198009
splints.|16650009|48300006

The uneven
loading
of the limb|66019005|243996003
in tight circles|255365009|354652004|228187009|354652004

excessive force|260378005|260378005|285653008
on the medial splint,|255561001|16650009
which
can
cause|23981006|134198009
it to
move|302000008|384598002|370125004
excessively relative|260378005|125677006|260378005|29920004
to the cannon bone,|370711008
causing|23981006

causes|134198009
excess loading|260378005
of the medial splint bone,|370680005
which
can
lead|88488004
to splints.[2]|16650009|48300006

Because
the splint bone|16650009|272673000|16650009|3138006|16650009|90780006|16650009|128530007
does
have
some mobility|363803005|246197003
independent of the cannon bone,|370711008
it
can
cause|23981006|134198009
tension|53489000
and
strain|48532005|276768000
on the periosteum|33840008
of the splint bone|16650009|272673000|16650009|3138006|16650009|90780006|16650009|128530007
where the interosseous ligament attaches.|182410007|102491009

The horse|35354009|388441000|388445009
will
then
lay|40199007|255576009
down new bone|7147002|272673000|7147002|3138006|7147002|90780006|7147002|128530007
and
the area|42798000
will
become
inflamed.

"Blind splints"|16650009|48300006|16650009|48300006
are
named|27468005
because
the bony reaction happens|263686003|263851003
on the inside border|260521003|112233002
between the splint bone|16650009|272673000|16650009|3138006|16650009|90780006|16650009|128530007
and
cannon bone,|370711008
where
it
can
not
be
seen
,
and
is
usually
not palpable.|103357000

Besides causing pain|23981006|22253000
as any active splint reaction|55561003|16650009|263851003
can
,
the swelling|423666004|442672001
can
impinge
on the suspensory ligament.|52082005|182358004

This condition|260905004
is
difficult to|52925006
diagnose|439401001
,
but
ultrasound|359659005
is
generally diagnostic.|439401001|261004008

MRI|113091000
and
CT also
show
these well.[4]|20572008

Splints usually|16650009|48300006
cause|23981006|134198009
mild lameness|255604002|16973004|255604002|275520000
(
a grade|258349007|371469007
of 1?2|303183002
out of 5|264706000|264605009
).

The injured area|42798000
is
hot, painful,|36349006
and
inflamed
with a small bony swelling.|255507004|263686003|423666004|255507004|263686003|442672001

However,
splints|16650009|48300006
do
not always
cause|23981006|134198009
lameness,|16973004|275520000
especially
once "cold".|285686007|82272006|84162001

More severe lameness|242762006|24484000|16973004|242762006|24484000|275520000
is
sometimes
associated|47429007
with a fractured splint bone,|125605004|16650009
or
soft tissue injury|282026002
adjacent|18769003
to the splints.|16650009|48300006

"Blind splints" usually|16650009|48300006|16650009|48300006
produce
mild lameness|255604002|16973004|255604002|275520000
that
is
difficult to|52925006
pinpoint
because
there
is
no obvious swelling,|423666004|442672001
pain,|22253000
or
bony changes|263686003|243326001|263686003|263703002
related|272151006|262094002
to the exterior
of the splint bone.|16650009|272673000|16650009|3138006|16650009|90780006|16650009|128530007

At times,|410669006|417929005
bone proliferation|272673000|30217000|3138006|30217000|90780006|30217000|128530007|30217000
on the axial border|24422004|112233002
of the splint bone|16650009|272673000|16650009|3138006|16650009|90780006|16650009|128530007
can
be
seen
radiographically,
but
ultrasound|359659005
is
much more sensitive|242762006|83185005|4757001|83185005
for detecting blind splints.|260373001|16650009|260373001|48300006|260373001|16650009|260373001|48300006

The body|279495008|123037004
will
eventually
absorb
some
of the bone|272673000|3138006|90780006|128530007
it
placed|257557008|421066005
down
in the splint,|16650009
flattening
out
the splint|16650009
over several months|261028005|258706009
and
possibly|60022001
making
it completely
disappear.

A splint|16650009
involving|248448006
the cannon
alone|105529008
is
more likely to|242762006|2931005
disappear
than one|421379005
involving|248448006
the splint bone|16650009|272673000|16650009|3138006|16650009|90780006|16650009|128530007
itself.

The horse|35354009|388441000|388445009
should
have
a reduced workload|260400001
for 1?3 weeks.|260305007|258705008

If
a trainer|228239008
does
not
decrease|260400001|260370003
the workload sufficiently,
and
the splint bone|16650009|272673000|16650009|3138006|16650009|90780006|16650009|128530007
continues|255238004
to
receive
concussion,|81371004
the injury
is
likely to|2931005
continue|255238004
or
worsen.|230993007|390772001

Light exercise|56242006|61686008|371268001|61686008
on soft ground|37378003
is
best|20572008|3442003
for a horse|35354009|388441000|388445009
with splints,|16650009|48300006
as
work|261041009
can
help
encourage
the needed bone growth to|410525008|272673000|410525008|3138006|410525008|90780006|410525008|128530007|103325001|272673000|103325001|3138006|103325001|90780006|103325001|128530007
heal|298005009
the splint.|16650009

Those trainers|228239008
concerned
with the cosmetic appearance|81024003|386548000|81024003|255412001|261513001|386548000|261513001|255412001
of their horse|35354009|388441000|388445009
usually prefer|225773000
to hand-walk twice daily|85562004|129006008|229799001|302539009|129006008|229799001
and
keep
the animal|387961004
stalled
until the splint|16650009
is
resolved,
eliminating
the chance
that
the splint|16650009
will
accidentally
be
knocked
during work|261041009
and
the swelling|423666004|442672001
increased.|35105006|260366006

Several days|261028005|258703001
of cold therapy,|26782000|308693008
sweats,|74616000|161857006
and
NSAIDs|372665008
can
help
a "hot" splint.|264018002|16650009

NSAIDs|372665008
can
help
reduce|260400001
the inflammation|257552002
and
help
the bone growth|272673000|3138006|90780006|128530007
by
doing
so.|223528007

However,
none|260413007
of these treatments|276239002
are
incredibly effective.|255403003|254648000

The most important factor|4757001
is
time.|410669006

Counter-irritants,|418874002
which
increase|260366006
inflammation,|257552002
only
hinder
the formation|11798007|255277001
of bone|272673000|3138006|90780006|128530007
and
can
actually
prolong|255224006
the healing process.|298005009|415178003|90910008|415178003

Surgery to|83578000
remove|127485006
the fractured end|125605004|261782000|125605004|422117008
of the splint bone,|16650009|272673000|16650009|3138006|16650009|90780006|16650009|128530007
particularly
in the lower third,|261122009|70905002
is
typically successful.|385669000

However,
surgical removal|118292001|128303001|128304007
of the bone growth|272673000|3138006|90780006|128530007
in large splints,|255509001|16650009|255509001|48300006
performed|398166005
by chiseling|18411005
it away,
usually
does
not
produce
satisfying results.|394617004

Often,|70232002
bone growth|272673000|3138006|90780006|128530007
is
stimulated
by the surgery,|83578000
and
the size|277049003
of the splint|16650009
is
increased.|35105006|260366006

Only
about a third|70905002
of the time|410669006
is
surgery|83578000
at all successful.|385669000

Prognosis|20481000
is
excellent|425405005
in uncomplicated cases.|263914008|398241000|263914008|413769002

The horse|35354009|388441000|388445009
will
be
able to|371150009
return|7528007
to full work|261015003|261041009
once the inflammation|257552002
and
pain ceases.|22253000

Although
the horse usually|35354009|388441000|388445009
recovers|74822006
quite quickly,
horses|35354009
with "blind splints"|16650009|48300006|16650009|48300006
may
take|419652001
longer|255511005
because
there
may
be
impingement
on the suspensory ligament.|52082005|182358004

The calcification
of the splint|16650009
is
usually
a permanent blemish,|6934004
though
over|21481007
a period|259037005
of many years,|258707000
the excess calcification|260378005|260378005|260378005
may
be
reabsorbed
to some degree,|258395000|246173007
occasionally
to the point
that
the splint|16650009
is
no longer visible.|255511005|24054004
