*Polymyositis** (* * PM * *)|31384009
("inflammation|257552002
of many muscles"|91727004
)
is
a type|261664005
of chronic inflammation|84499006
of the muscles|91727004
(inflammatory myopathy|26889001
related|272151006|262094002
to dermatomyositis|396230008|396229003
and
inclusion body myositis.|72315009

Symptoms
include|55919000
pain,|22253000
with marked weakness|46998006|13791008|46998006|46998006|260407003
and/or
loss
of muscle mass|271696003
in the proximal musculature,|40415009
particularly
in the shoulder|16982005|361103004
and
pelvic girdle.|360010001

The hip extensors|29836001|85710004
are
often severely|70232002|24484000
affected|247591002|248448006
,
leading|236874000
to particular difficulty|371157007
in ascending stairs|79458005
and
rising
from a seated position.|33586001|246449006|360297006|246449006

Thickening|263899003
of the skin|119325001|39937001|181469002
on the fingers|7569003|259052003
and
hands|85562004
(sclerodactyly|201051000
)
is
a frequent feature,|70232002
although
this
is
non-specific|10003008
and
occurs|272120004
in other autoimmune connective tissue disorders.|74964007|362992004

Dysphagia|40739000
(difficulty swallowing|40739000
)
and/or
other aspects|74964007
of oesophageal dysmotility|266434009|79962008
occur|272120004
in
as
many
as 1/3|260305007
of patients.|116154003

Low grade fever|304213008
and
peripheral adenopathy|14414005|111590001|14414005|30746006
may
be
present.|52101004|246105001

Foot drop|6077001
in one|421379005
or
both feet|56459004|259051005
can
be
a symptom
of advanced polymyositis|86005002|31384009
and
inclusion body myositis.|72315009

Polymyositis|31384009
is
also
associated|47429007
with interstitial lung diseases.|233703007

Polymyositis|31384009
is
linked
to an increase|260366006
in the occurrence|272120004
of certain cancers|17162000|363346000
(particularly Non-Hodgkin lymphoma,|118601006
lung|39607008|181216001
and
bladder cancers|399326009
)
,
but
the overall association|263534001|272151006
is
weaker|13791008|260407003
than
in the related condition Dermatomyositis.|272151006|260905004|396230008|272151006|260905004|396229003|262094002|260905004|396230008|262094002|260905004|396229003

The latter
is
linked
to a significant increase|386134007|260366006
in the risk|30207005
of a variety
of malignances,|21594007
including|55919000
ovarian, lung,|15497006|39607008|15497006|181216001|83238006|39607008|83238006|181216001|181464007|39607008|181464007|181216001
and
pancreatic cancer.|372142002|363418001

Polymyositis|31384009
tends
to
become
evident|18669006
in adulthood,|41847000
presenting|246105001
with bilateral proximal muscle weakness often|51440002|249939004|70232002
noted
in the upper legs|261183002|30021000
due to early fatigue|264499004|84229001
while
walking.|129006008

Sometimes
the weakness|13791008|260407003
presents|52101004|246105001
itself
as
an inability to
rise
from a seated position|33586001|246449006|360297006|246449006
without
help
or
an inability to
raise|260399008
one's arms|421379005|40983000
above one's head.|421379005|69536005|421379005|302548004

The weakness|13791008|260407003
is
generally progressive,|255314001
accompanied
by lymphocytic inflammation|56972008|257552002|255429003|257552002
(mainly cytotoxic T lymphocytes.|420638008

Polymyositis,|31384009
like dermatomyositis,|396230008|396229003
strikes|89098005
females|248152002
with greater frequency|263768009|260864003|263768009|272123002
than males.|248153007

The skin involvement|119325001|248448006|39937001|248448006|181469002|248448006
of dermatomyositis|396230008|396229003
is
absent|2667000
in polymyositis.|31384009

Another concern
is
Interstitial lung disease (ILD).|51615001|233703007

The cause|134198009
of polymyositis|31384009
is
unknown|261665006
and
may
involve|248448006
viruses|49872002
and
autoimmune factors.|263680009

Cancer|363346000|372087000
may
trigger|410658008
polymyositis|31384009
and
dermatomyositis,|396230008|396229003
possibly|60022001
through an immune reaction|255386009|263851003
against cancer|363346000|372087000
that also
attacks|216299002
a component|246093002
of muscles.|91727004

In rare cases,|84638005|398241000|84638005|413769002|103356009|398241000|103356009|413769002
the cause|134198009
is
known to|36692007
be
infectious,
associated|47429007
with the pathogens|264418008
that
cause|23981006|134198009
Lyme disease,|23502006
toxoplasmosis,|187192000
and
other infectious agents.|74964007|36272005

Polymyositis usually|31384009
is
considered non-fatal|399166001
in the absence|2667000|418560003
of ILD.|233703007

It
is
hypothesized
that
an initial injury causes|884001|134198009|232714002|134198009
release|58000006|68776005|258760001|129299003|115956009
of muscle auto antigen,|91727004|7120007
which
is
subsequently
taken|419652001
up
by macrophages|58986001
and
presented|246105001
to CD4+ TH cells.|115412003|223594002|115412003|71763007

Activated TH cells|29594005
synthesize
IFN-?
that
stimulate
further macrophages|46053002|58986001
and
further inflammatory mediator release|46053002|49352002|58000006|46053002|49352002|68776005|46053002|49352002|258760001|46053002|49352002|129299003|46053002|49352002|115956009
like IL-1|50762005
and
TNF-?

Another important event|272379006
in the pathogenesis|303109001
of Polymyositis|31384009
is
the increased expression|35105006|10012005|260366006|10012005
of MHC proteins|88878007
by m/s cells.|4421005

Auto-Ag
is
presented|246105001
in association|263534001|272151006
with MHC-I molecules|42146005|290005005|22971001|290005005
on the surface|410678000
of Myocytes
and
is
recognized
by CD8 cytotoxic T cells|420638008
that subsequently
initiate
m/s destruction._[citation|258311008|64597002

Diagnosis|439401001
is
fourfold,
including|55919000
elevation|103720008|255456001
of creatine kinase,|75828004
history|392521001
and
physical examination,|5880005
electromyograph (EMG) alteration,|42803009
and
a positive muscle biopsy.|258758003|178263003|258758003|309507001|10828004|178263003|10828004|309507001

Sporadic inclusion body myositis (sIBM)|75741005|72315009
:
IBM|72315009
is
often|70232002
confused|286933003
with
(
misdiagnosed
as
)
polymyositis|31384009
and
dermatomyositis|396230008|396229003
that
does
not
respond
to treatment|276239002|416118004
is
likely IBM.|2931005|72315009

sIBM
comes
on over months|21481007|258706009
to years|258707000
;
polymyositis|31384009
comes
on over weeks|21481007|258705008
to months.|258706009

It
appears
that sIBM
and
polymyositis|31384009
share
some common features,|72906007
especially
the initial sequence|884001|72633008|232714002|72633008
of immune system activation|116003000
;
however,
polymyositis|31384009
does
not
display
the subsequent muscle degeneration|255260001|91727004|33359002
and
protein abnormalities|88878007|276654001
as
seen
in IBM.|72315009

As well, polymyositis|20572008|31384009
tends
to
respond
well|20572008
to treatments|276239002
;
IBM|72315009
does
not.

IBM|72315009
and
polymyositis apparently|31384009
involve|248448006
different disease mechanisms|263735002|64572001|257544000
than
are
seen
in dermatomyositis.|396230008|396229003

Presence|386397008
of Anti Jo antibodies|223610001|68498002
in
>65%|264695004
of patients.|116154003

Elevated serum creatine kinase|75540009|67922002|75828004
is
characteristic,
but
not specific|69658003
to polymyositis.|31384009

Anti-signal recognition particle antibodies|38952000|312020002|68498002
(anti-SRP antibodies|68498002
)
are
associated|47429007
with polymyositis,|31384009
but
are
not very specific|260358002|69658003
for it.

For individuals|125676002|385435006
with polymyositis,|31384009
the presence|386397008
of anti-SRP antibodies|68498002
are
associated|47429007
with more prominent muscle weakness|242762006|4657009|242762006|4657009|26544005
and
atrophy.[2]|13331008

The first line treatment|255216001|50009006|276239002|255216001|50009006|416118004|232714002|50009006|276239002|232714002|50009006|416118004
for polymyositis|31384009
is
corticosteroids.|79440004

A course|288524001
of high dose prednisone,|261829003|116602009
tapered|257935006
according to response
will
often|70232002
bring|68369002
about a dramatic improvement.

It
is
also useful to
distinguish
from inclusion body myositis.|72315009

Unresponsive patients|20646008|116154003|422768004|116154003
may
be
tried
on other immunosuppressive medications.|74964007|372823004|410942007

IVIG|350344000
(intravenous immunoglobulin|350344000
)
has
also
shown
to
be
a beneficial treatment.|276239002|416118004

Specialized exercise therapy|67995009|229065009|229065009
may
supplement|373453009
treatment to|276239002|416118004
enhance
quality|263496004
of life.|224130005

The main treatment|63161005|276239002|63161005|416118004
is
with corticosteroid medications.|79440004|410942007

In people|125676002
who
fail
to
respond
to corticosteroids,|79440004
medications to|410942007
suppress|245780008
the immune system,|116003000
such as methotrexate|387381009
and
azathioprine,|372574004
may
be
used.|394850002

Intravenous gamma globulin|116648000|255560000|116648000
has
been
tried
as well as
certain biological agents.|17162000
