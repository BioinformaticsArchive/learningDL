(
from Greek ???? - _ph?n?_,|1451003|27327002|1451003|264723009|1451003|264724003|1451003|264725002|1451003|365723003|1451003
"sound"[1]|68325009
and ????? - _phobos_,
"
fear|1402001
",
[2] also|260306008
called
*
*ligyrophobia
*
*
)
is
a fear|1402001
of loud sounds.|24547000

It
can
also
mean|255586005
a fear|1402001
of voices,
or
a fear|1402001
of one's own voice.|421379005

For example,
listening|37931006
to a CD
that starts|255395001
with a minute|258701004|255507004|286549009|356624006
of silence|263872000
and
then suddenly
goes
into loud rock music|24547000
would
be
extremely startling
for most people,|125676002
assuming
they
had
no prior knowledge|236874000|225795001
of the content|276824008
of the CD.

Being
startled
is
in itself
a normal reaction,|17621005|263851003|258744000|263851003
but
the key difference|263735002
is
that people|125676002
with ligyrophobia actively
fear|1402001
such an occurrence.|272120004

Ligyrophobics
may
be
fearful|279119006
of devices|303607000|49062001
that
can
suddenly
emit|113067009
loud sounds,|24547000
such as computer speakers
or
fire alarms.|80032004|39869006|257195008|39869006

When
operating
a home theater system,|261770009|257715004|246333005
computer,
television,|255712000
CD player,
etc.,
they
may
wish
to
have
the volume|118565006|419569009
turned|282987006
down all
the way before
doing
anything that
would
cause|23981006|134198009
the speakers to
emit|113067009
sound,|68325009
so
that
once
the command to
produce
sound|68325009
is
given,|419582001
the user
can
raise|260399008
the volume|118565006|419569009
of the speakers
to a comfortable listening level.|250891003

They
may
avoid
parades
and
carnivals
due to the loud instruments|24547000|57134006
such as drums.

Other ligyrophobics|74964007
also steer|288339001
clear|263707001
of any events|272379006
in which
fireworks|30926007
are
to
be
let
off.

Another example
is
watching
someone
blow|387085005
up a balloon|47006006|34263000
beyond its normal capacity.|17621005|258744000

This
is
often|70232002
an unsettling,
even disturbing thing
for a person|125676002
with ligyrophobia to
observe
,
as
he
or
she
anticipates
a loud sound|24547000|24547000|68325009
when
the balloon pops.|47006006|34263000

When
balloons|47006006|34263000
pop|255352000
,
two types|420797005|261664005
of reactions|263851003
are
heavy breathing|410712002|14910006|410712002|258162000
and
panic attacks.|225624000

The sufferer
becomes
anxious to|48694002
get
away
from the source|260753009
of the loud sound.|24547000|24547000|68325009

Phonophobia|313387002
occurs|272120004
with an estimated 15%|414135002
of the world's population|385436007|389109008
known|36692007
to
suffer
from it._[dubious ?

It
may
also
be
related|272151006|262094002
to,
caused|23981006|134198009
by,
or
confused|286933003
with "hyperacusis",|25289003
extreme sensitivity|12565001|35209006|12565001|365705006
to loud sounds_[citation|24547000

refers|439980006
to an extreme form|12565001|246176004
of misophonia.[5]
