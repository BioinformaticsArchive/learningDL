(cranio-
from Greek ???????,|1451003
"skull",|89546000
the other parts Latin|74964007|260726005
)
,
is
an extremely rare congenital disorder|84638005|66091009|103356009|66091009
whereby parts|260726005
(accessories
)
or
all
of the face|89545001|302549007
is
duplicated|89049001
on the head.[1][2][3][4]|69536005|302548004

Although
classically
considered
conjoined twinning|41337007
(
which it
resembles
)
,
this anomaly
is
not normally
due to the fusion|31883006|122501008
or
incomplete separation|255599008|16640008|255599008|160788005|255609007|16640008|255609007|160788005
of two embryos.|420797005|57991002

It
is
the result|394617004
of a protein|88878007
called
sonic hedgehog homolog (SHH).|106922004|388917009

(
The name
of this protein|88878007
was
inspired|14910006
by the Sonic
the Hedgehog videogame character[5]|106922004|388917009
and
is
part|260726005
of an idiosyncratic[6] naming tradition|56840009|27468005|263901007
in molecular biology|290005005|12893009
research
that
some
have
criticized
as frivolous.
)
[7][8]

The SHH protein|88878007
and
its corresponding gene|67271001
have
been
found|404684003
to
play|300776002
an important role
in signaling craniofacial patterning|38952000
during embryonic development.|57991002|278923009

Among other things,|74964007
the SHH protein governs|88878007
the width|103355008
of facial features.|89545001

In excess|260378005
it
leads|88488004|236874000
to widening|90522003
of facial features|89545001
and
to duplication|89049001
of facial structures.|89545001

The greater|263768009
the widening,|90522003
the more|242762006
of the structures
are
duplicated|89049001
,
often|70232002
in a mirror image form.|47162009|363679005|246176004|47162009|278395004|246176004

This
has
been
demonstrated
in the laboratory|261904005
by introducing pellets|127487003|420768007
of the SHH protein|88878007
into chicken embryos,|409910000|57991002|226955001|57991002
resulting|42752001
in chickens|409910000|226955001
with duplicate beaks.|1305003|27883009

Insufficient amounts|71978007|107651007|423437008|107651007
of
that protein|88878007
lead|88488004
to opposite conditions|260905004
such as cyclopia|205798005
where facial features|89545001
are
insufficiently
developed.[10]

Healthy brain development|263775005|12738006|278923009|263775005|258335003|278923009
is
also dependent|371154000
on the signaling function|38952000|246464006
of the SHH protein.|88878007

During embryonic development,|57991002|278923009
the SHH protein|88878007
directs|255589003
embryonic cells to|57991002|4421005
organize|385650005
in specific areas|69658003|42798000
that later
become specialized neural tissues,|67995009|91728009|91728009
thus
controlling|54776003|31509003
the size|277049003
and
shape|107644003|246176004|300842002
of brain structures.|12738006

Diprosopus often|62192003|70232002
occurs|272120004
in combination|89780004
with other congenital disorders,|74964007|66091009
particularly anencephaly,|89369001
neural tube defect|253098009
and
cardiac malformations.|80891009|276654001

When
present,|52101004|246105001
the brain|12738006|258335003
may
show
abnormalities|276654001
ranging
from partial to|255609007
complete|255594003
duplication|89049001
of brain structures,|12738006
and/or
underdevelopment|38146002
of brain tissues.[13][14]|256865009

Few two-faced animals|57176003|420797005|89545001|387961004|57176003|420797005|302549007|387961004
have
survived
due to associated internal organ abnormalities|118172004|260521003|276654001
and
brain abnormalities.|12738006|276654001|258335003|276654001

One|421379005
of the most famous|4757001
was
Ditto
the pig.|78678003|388393002|388392007

Ditto
was
raised|260399008
to adulthood,|41847000
but
died|419620001|419099009
of pneumonia|205237003
caused|23981006|134198009
by food inhalation|255620007|14910006|255620007|255620007|422237004
when
breathing|14910006|258162000
through one muzzle|421379005|41127006
while
eating|48263008
with the other.|74964007

Cats|448169003|388618001
with the condition|260905004
are
known|36692007
as 'Janus cats',|57918009|448169003|57918009|388618001
after
the Roman god.|223655008

In July 2006,
a 6-year-old male Janus cat called "Frank|258707000|70753007|248153007|57918009|448169003|258707000|70753007|248153007|57918009|33384004|258707000|70753007|248153007|57918009|388626009|259039008|70753007|248153007|57918009|448169003|259039008|70753007|248153007|57918009|33384004|259039008|70753007|248153007|57918009|388626009
and
Louie"
from Millbury,
Massachusetts USA received publicity.|224066008|223688001

In his case,|398241000
only one esophagus|50607009|421379005|32849002|50607009|421379005|181245004|420295001|421379005|32849002|420295001|421379005|181245004
(
and
possibly only one trachea|60022001|421379005|44567001|60022001|421379005|181213009
was
functional|40143009|246464006
and
this aided survival.|62479008|246088000

In September 2011,
when
Frank
and
Louie
was
12 years old,|258707000|70753007
it
was
announced
that
he
will
appear
in the 2012 Guinness Book|226507008|278212002
of World
Records
as the longest-surviving Janus cat|255511005|57918009|448169003|255511005|57918009|33384004|255511005|57918009|388626009
on record.[17]

Most human infants|278412004|418119000
with diprosopus|62192003
are
stillborn.

Known instances|36692007
of humans|278412004
with diprosopus surviving|62192003
for longer|255511005
than minutes|258701004|255507004|356624006
to hours past birth|258702006|3950001
are
very rare|260358002|84638005|260358002|103356009
;
only
a few
are
recorded.

In 2002
and
2003,
two living male infants|420797005|248153007|418119000
with partial diprosopus|255609007|62192003
were
described
in the medical literature|74188005
in separate case reports.|263869007|398241000|229059009|263869007|398241000|223458004

One infant|421379005|418119000
was
born|106970005|81827009|398209006
with duplication|89049001
of the nose|260540009|181195007
and
the cerebral frontal lobes,|314139009|81654009|83251001
two widely spaced eyes,|420797005|81745001
a small,|255507004
underdeveloped
central eye socket,|26216008|363654007
and
a large, asymmetric mouth.|255509001|4128009|74262004|255509001|4128009|123851003|255509001|4128009|21082005|255509001|4128009|181220002

The other infant|74964007|418119000
was
born|106970005|81827009|398209006
with duplication|89049001
of the upper|261183002
and
lower jaw,|48077000
two tongues|420797005|21974007
ending|261782000|422117008
in the same base,|262126009
cleft palate,|253986002
a slightly divided tip|425404009|422033008|233445008
of the nose,|260540009|181195007
and
two widely spaced eyes,|420797005|81745001
as well as
absence|2667000|418560003
of the corpus callosum,|88442005
duplication|89049001
of the pituitary gland|56329008|181125003
and
stalk,
and
abnormalities|276654001
in the midbrain.|61962009|279099009

Because
they
were
born|106970005|81827009|398209006
with a milder,|255604002
partial form|255609007|246176004
of diprosopus,|62192003
both
infants|418119000
were
considered
candidates
for surgical correction|83578000
of their abnormal facial features.|263654008|89545001

In 2008,
a baby girl|418119000|431549007
born|106970005|81827009|398209006
in India,|223600005
Lali Singh,
became
the most recently known person to|4757001|6493001|36692007|125676002
have
the condition diprosopus.|260905004|62192003

She
was
born|106970005|81827009|398209006
March 10,
2008
in Sanai Samp?ra village|224806006
near Delhi
;
the birth|3950001
was
delayed
by dystocia|45757002|199746004
caused|23981006|134198009
by her large head,|12138000
and
she
was
born|106970005|81827009|398209006
in a hospital|285201006
with an episiotomy.|85548006

She
was
one|421379005
of the very few infants|260358002|418119000
with diprosopus to|62192003
survive
well past birth.|20572008|3950001

She
may
have
been
the only|50607009|420295001
known|36692007
living|224130005|419749002
individual|125676002|385435006
with complete facial duplication.|255594003|89545001|89049001

Her facial features|89545001
included|55919000
two pairs|420797005
of eyes,|81745001
two noses,|420797005|260540009
and
two mouths|420797005|74262004
(
but
only one|50607009|421379005|420295001|421379005
pair
of ears|117590005|1910005
).

Lali Singh,
daughter|66089001
of Sushma
and
Vinod Singh,
lived|224130005|419749002
in the Indian village|224806006
of Saini Sunpura.

There,
she
was
seen
as the reincarnation
of the goddess Durga,
who
has
three eyes.|421291004|81745001

It
was
also
thought|88952004
that Lali
was
an incarnation
of the Hindu god Ganesh.|61154002|160545000

As of April 2008,
Sushma
and
Vinod Singh
had
declined
an
offer|410527000
from local doctors to|255470001|309343006
evaluate
their daughter|66089001
through CT
or
MRI scanning.|113091000|373205008|113091000

Without diagnostic imaging,|363679005
it
was
not possible to|371930009|60022001
know|36692007
the full extent|261015003|255590007
to which
the child's condition|410601007|260905004|160499008|260905004
might
have
affected|247591002|248448006
her brain|12738006|258335003
and
other vital structures|74964007|260410005
in her head|69536005|302548004
and
neck.|45048000|302550007

Thus,
any estimation|414135002
of her ability to|371150009
survive
or
even
thrive
could
only
be
speculative,
though
Lali's family|35359004
described
her
as
functioning|246464006
normally.

It
is
also
unknown|261665006
whether neurosurgeons|45544007
or
craniofacial surgeons,|304292004
if
consulted|11429006
,
would
have
had
feasible solutions to|8537005
offer|410527000
with respect
to corrective surgery.|83578000

A local doctor told|255470001|309343006
reporters|51764002
that
the baby|418119000
should
be
considered
a healthy child|102506008
who currently|15240007
was
living|224130005|419749002
a normal life,|17621005|224130005|258744000|224130005
a previously unknown occurrence|261665006|272120004
among sufferers
of the disorder.[20]|64572001

Lali's two middle eyes|420797005|255562008|81745001|420797005|399488007|81745001
suffered
from corneal opacity|413921009
due to abnormal anatomy|263654008|91723000
of the facial muscles,|25903009
which
prevented|116699007
her
from properly
closing|29179001
those eyes.|81745001

(Before,|236874000|421718005
it
was
wrongly
blamed
on camera flashes.|14364002|56170001
)

Cleft palate|253986002
caused|23981006|134198009
difficulty feeding|78164000
her
under village conditions.|224806006|260905004

A poor diet|310502008
of
bottle-fed|268472006
sugar solution|2331003|8537005|2331003|77899000|74801000|8537005|74801000|77899000
and
diluted milk,|421399004|3718001|421399004|119321005|421399004|70813002
allowed
to drip
down her throat|54066008|49928004|264231000
as
she
could
not
suck|90485000|288978006|420045007
properly
because of the cleft palate,|253986002
weakened
her condition,|260905004
and
vomiting|249497008
and
infection
started.|385652002

Admission|32485007
to hospital|285201006
was
delayed
by discussion|223482009
(
including|55919000
taking|419652001
her
back home|261770009
from hospital|285201006
)
among her extended family|255536004|35359004|288467006|35359004|255590007|35359004
and
her village's headman.|224806006

Finally,
her parents|40683002
alarmed|39869006
at her illness|39104002
and
dehydration,|34095006
defied
her other relatives|74964007|125677006
and
took|419652001
her
back
to hospital,|285201006
where
under proper medical treatment|74188005|276239002|74188005|416118004
including|55919000
antibiotic|255631004
and
a saline drip|373757009
she
started|385652002
to
improve|385425000|3442003|385633008
,
stopped vomiting,|385654001|249497008
started drinking milk|385652002|160573003|3718001|385652002|160573003|119321005|385652002|160573003|70813002|385652002|30953006|3718001|385652002|30953006|119321005|385652002|30953006|70813002
and
defecating normally
;
but
