*Dysphagia|40739000
*
*
is
the medical term|74188005
for the symptom
of difficulty|371157007
in swallowing.|54731003|288937009

Although
classified|73504009
under "symptoms
and
signs"|72670004
in ICD-10,|70199000
[4]|260308009
the term
is
sometimes
used|394850002
as a condition|260905004
in its own right.|24028007

Sufferers
are
sometimes
unaware|418107008|406124004
of their dysphagia.[8][9]|40739000

It
is
derived
from the Greek _dys_ meaning bad|1451003|29159009|255586005|556001
or
disordered,|64572001
and
_phago_ meaning "eat".|48263008

It
may
be
a sensation|106148006|271712005|272144002
that
suggests
difficulty|371157007
in the passage|255592004
of solids|35702001|78910004
or
liquids|33463005
from the mouth|74262004|123851003|21082005|181220002
to the stomach,|69695003|181246003
[10]
a lack|41277001
of pharyngeal sensation,|54066008|106148006|54066008|271712005|54066008|272144002
or
various other inadequacies|256220008|71978007
of the swallowing mechanism.|54731003|257544000|288937009|257544000

Dysphagia|40739000
is
distinguished
from other symptoms|74964007
including|55919000
odynophagia,|30233002
which
is
defined
as painful swallowing,|30233002
[11]
and
globus,
which
is
the sensation|106148006|271712005|272144002
of a lump|300848003
in the throat.|54066008|49928004|264231000

A psychogenic dysphagia|278926001|40739000
is
known|36692007
as phagophobia.

It
is
also
worthwhile
to
refer|439980006
to the physiology|1360005
of swallowing|54731003|288937009
in understanding dysphagia.|66216009|40739000

Some patients|116154003
have
limited awareness|255469002|312012004
of their dysphagia,|40739000
so
lack|41277001
of the symptom
does
not
exclude|77765009
an underlying disease.|64572001

When
dysphagia goes|40739000
undiagnosed
or
untreated, patients|25265005|116154003
are
at a high risk|15508007
of pulmonary aspiration|68052005
and
subsequent aspiration pneumonia|255260001|422588002
secondary|2603003|81170007
to food|255620007
or
liquids|33463005
going
the wrong way
into the lungs.|39607008

Some people|125676002
present|52101004|246105001
with "silent aspiration"|263872000|14910006|263872000|278847003|263872000|129316008|263872000|68052005
and
do
not
cough|272039006
or
show
outward signs|255543005|72670004
of aspiration.|14910006|278847003|129316008|68052005

Undiagnosed dysphagia|40739000
can
also
result|394617004
in dehydration,|34095006
malnutrition,|248325000
and
renal failure.|42399005

Some signs|72670004
and
symptoms
of oropharyngeal dysphagia|71457002
include|55919000
difficulty controlling food|371157007|54776003|255620007|371157007|31509003|255620007
in the mouth,|74262004|123851003|21082005|181220002
inability to
control|31509003
food|255620007
or
saliva|256897009
in the mouth,|74262004|123851003|21082005|181220002
difficulty|371157007
initiating
a swallow,|107160003|421521009
coughing|272039006
,
choking|249489001
,
frequent pneumonia,|70232002|205237003
unexplained weight loss,|422868009
gurgly
or
wet voice|17461003
after swallowing,|54731003|288937009
nasal regurgitation,|85023004
and
dysphagia|40739000
(patient complaint|116154003|409586006
of swallowing difficulty|40739000
).

When
asked
where the food|255620007
is
getting
stuck,
patients|116154003
will
often|70232002
point
to the cervical|261064006
(neck region|123958008
as the site|10546003
of the obstruction.|26036001

The actual site|10546003
of obstruction|26036001
is
always
at
or
below the level|258395000|276625007
at which
the level|258395000|276625007
of obstruction|26036001
is
perceived.|81742003

The most common symptom|4757001|72906007
of esophageal dysphagia|40890009
is
the inability
to swallow solid food,|288943006|35702001|288943006|78910004|288943006|421378002|107160003|228060008|421521009|228060008
which
the patient|116154003
will
describe
as '
becoming
stuck'
or
'
held|421139008
up'
before
it
either
passes
into the stomach|69695003|181246003
or
is
regurgitated.

Pain|22253000
on swallowing|54731003|288937009
or
odynophagia|30233002
is
a distinctive symptom
that
can
be
highly indicative|75540009
of carcinoma,|68453008
although
it also
has
numerous other causes|260396001|134198009
that
are
not
related|272151006|262094002
to cancer.|363346000|372087000

Achalasia|45564002|48531003
is
a major exception|255603008
to usual pattern|272135003
of dysphagia|40739000
in that
swallowing|54731003|288937009
of fluid|32457005|33463005|255765007
tends
to
cause|23981006|134198009
more difficulty|242762006|371157007
than swallowing solids.|54731003|35702001|54731003|78910004|288937009|35702001|288937009|78910004

In achalasia,|45564002|48531003
there
is
idiopathic destruction|54690008|64597002
of parasympathetic ganglia|78094009
of the auerbach submucosal plexus|69854003|8595004
of the entire esophagus,|181245004
which
results|394617004
in functional narrowing|40143009|25659002|40143009|134223000|246464006|25659002|246464006|134223000
of the lower esophagus,|261122009|32849002|261122009|181245004
and
peristaltic failure|28423000|76797004
throughout its length.|410668003

Dysphagia|40739000
is
classified|73504009
into two major types|420797005|255603008|261664005
:

Causes|134198009
of
*
*oropharyngeal dysphagia|71457002
*
*
include|55919000
:

Please
refer|439980006
to _Etiology|134198009
and
Differential Diagnosis_|47965005
on the oropharyngeal dysphagia page|71457002
for a more extensive list.|242762006|41118005

Causes|134198009
of
*
*esophageal dysphagia|40890009
*
*
can
be
divided|422033008
into mechanical|261018001
and
functional causes.|40143009|134198009|246464006|134198009

Esophageal dysphagia|40890009
is
almost always
caused|23981006|134198009
by disease|64572001
in
or
adjacent|18769003
to the esophagus|32849002|181245004
but
occasionally
the lesion
is
in the pharynx|54066008|181211006
or
stomach.|69695003|181246003

In many|260396001
of the pathological conditions|394595002|78326006|394595002|260905004|29458008|78326006|29458008|260905004
causing|23981006
dysphagia,|40739000
the lumen|113342003|342806003|398252006
becomes
progressively
narrowed|134223000
and
indistensible.

Initially only fibrous solids|884001|263756000|35702001|884001|263756000|78910004|884001|255423002|35702001|884001|255423002|78910004
cause|23981006|134198009
difficulty|371157007
but
later
the problem|55607006
can
extend|255590007
to all solids|35702001|78910004
and
later even
to liquids.|33463005

Patients|116154003
with difficulty swallowing|40739000
may
benefit
from thickened fluids|228061007
if
the person|125676002
is
more comfortable|242762006
with those liquids.|33463005

In fact,
so
far,|46053002
there
are
no scientific study|110465008|224699009
that
proves|277025001
that
those thickened liquids|263899003|33463005
are
beneficial.

Dehydration|34095006
and or
undernutrition|248325000
can
be
a result|394617004
of those restriction|263856008
and
worsen|230993007|390772001
the risk|30207005
of aspiration pneumonia.|422588002

The gold-standard|2309006|371256005
for diagnosing oropharyngeal dysphagia|439401001|71457002
in countries|223369002
of the Commonwealth
are
via a Modified Barium Swallow Study|110465008|224699009
or
Videofluoroscopic Swallow Study|241149003|110465008|241149003|224699009
(Fluoroscopy.|44491008

This
is
a lateral video|49370004|257194007
(
and
AP
in some cases|398241000|413769002
)
X-ray|52250000|168537006|363680008
that
provides
objective information|410518001|260224007
on bolus transport,|57188001|360300001
safest consistency|107646001
of bolus
(different consistencies|263735002|107646001
including|55919000
honey,|227598003|421498008
nectar,
thin,|18043004
pudding|227682004
,
puree,
regular|17854005
)
,
and
possible head positioning|371930009|304631003|60022001|304631003
and/or
maneuvers
that
may
facilitate
swallow function|107160003|246464006|421521009|246464006
depending
on each individual's anatomy|125676002|91723000|385435006|91723000
and
physiology.|1360005

This study|110465008|224699009
can
be
performed|398166005
by a Speech-Language Pathologist|159026005|61909002
or
a clinical nutritionnist|58147004
(
in Canada|223686002
)
and
a Radiologist.|66862007

In the
US
and
many other|74964007
places|257557008
a FEES
(fibreoptic endoscopic evaluation|423827005|423827005|386053000|386053000
of swallowing - sometimes|54731003|288937009
with sensory testing|80314008
)
is
done
usually
by an otolaryngologist
(ear nose throat doctor|385383008|309343006
)
in conjunction with a speech therapist knowledgeable in the field|159026005|225795001|255798002
of swallowing.|54731003|288937009

This procedure|71388002
involves|248448006
the patient|116154003
eating|48263008
different consistencies|263735002|107646001
as above administered usually|261183002|418283001
by the speech therapist|159026005
while
the doctor|309343006
performs|398166005
a transnasal fiberoptic laryngoscopy|20922003|28760000
with a thin flexible tube|18043004|261012000|83059008
attached|102491009
to a light source|56242006|260753009|371268001|260753009
and
to a camera|14364002
so
the exam|225886003
can
be
recorded
for further analysis.|46053002|272389005

Chest X-ray|399208008
:
to
exclude|77765009
bronchial carcinoma.

Swallowing disorders|40739000
can
occur|272120004
in all age groups,|424144002|261586004|424144002|160481000
resulting|42752001
from congenital abnormalities,|276654001
structural damage,|37782003
and/or
medical conditions.|74188005|260905004

Swallowing problems|399122003
are
a common complaint|72906007|409586006
among older individuals,|70753007|125676002|70753007|385435006
and
the incidence
of dysphagia|40739000
is
higher|75540009|371879000
in the elderly,|105436006
[14]
in patients|116154003
who
have
had
strokes,|230690007
[15]
and
in patients|116154003
who
are
admitted|32485007
to acute care hospitals|272118002
or
chronic care facilities.|90734009

Dysphagia|40739000
is
a symptom
of many different causes,|263735002|134198009
which
can
usually
be
elicited|263516000
through a careful history|392521001
by the treating physician.|28995006|309343006

A formal oropharyngeal dysphagia evaluation|246176004|71457002|246176004|71457002|386053000
is
performed|398166005
