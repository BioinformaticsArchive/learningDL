*Ergotism|51510002
*
*
is
the effect|253861007
of long-term ergot poisoning,|51510002
traditionally
due to the ingestion|111984006
of the alkaloids|419001004
produced
by the _Claviceps purpurea_ fungus|55811003|414561005
which
infects
rye|412068007|82011001
and
other cereals,|74964007|23182003
and
more recently|242762006|6493001
by the action|129264002
of a number|410680006|410681005
of ergoline-based drugs.|349893001|349893001|418836005

It
is
also
known|36692007
as
*
*ergotoxicosis
*
*,
*
*ergot poisoning|51510002
*
*
and
*
*Saint Anthony's Fire|80032004|257195008
*
*.

Ergot poisoning|51510002
is
a proposed explanation
of bewitchment.

The toxic ergoline derivatives|419614002
are
found|404684003
in ergot-based drugs|55811003|410942007|55811003|418836005|410942007|410942007|418836005|410942007
(
such as methylergometrine,|126074008
ergotamine|395975005
or
,
previously,
ergotoxine.|86988001

The deleterious side-effects
occur|272120004
either
under high dose|261829003
or
when
moderate doses|6736007|277406006
interact
with potentiators
such as azithromycin.|387531004

Historically,
eating|48263008
grain products|23182003|264331002
contaminated|62604006
with the fungus _Claviceps purpurea_ also caused ergotism.|414561005|55811003|23981006|51510002|414561005|55811003|134198009|51510002

Finally,
the alkaloids|419001004
can
also
pass
through lactation|169741004|63158009
from mother|72705000
to child,|410601007|160499008
causing|23981006
ergotism|51510002
in infants.|418119000

The symptoms
can
be
roughly
divided|422033008
into convulsive symptoms|91175000
and
gangrenous symptoms.|372070002

Convulsive symptoms|91175000
include|55919000
painful seizures|22253000|91175000
and
spasms,|45352006
diarrhea,|398032003
paresthesias,|91019004
itching|424492005
,
mental effects|253861007
including|55919000
mania|231494001
or
psychosis,|69322001|191525009
headaches,|25064002
nausea|422587007
and
vomiting.|249497008

Usually
the gastrointestinal effects|253861007
precede|236874000
central nervous system effects.|21483005|253861007|278199004|253861007

As well as
seizures there|91175000
can
be
hallucinations|7011001
resembling
those
produced
by LSD|15698006
(lysergic acid diethylamide,|15698006
to which
the ergot alkaloid ergotamine|32824001|395975005
is
an immediate precursor|88694003|49499008
and
therefore
shares
some structural similarities
)
,
although
ergot's hallucinations more strongly|55811003|7011001|7011001
resemble
a delirious|419567006
and
psychotic state,|280427006
whereas
LSD|15698006
is
not psychotomimetic.

The dry gangrene|67087007
is
a result|394617004
of vasoconstriction|32318003
induced|16404004
by the ergotamine-ergocristine alkaloids|395975005|419001004
of the fungus.|414561005

It
affects|4065008
the more poorly|242762006|556001
vascularized distal structures,|255451006|46053002
such as the fingers|7569003|259052003
and
toes.|29707007

Symptoms
include|55919000
desquamation|271767006
or
peeling,|257890000|51979000
weak peripheral pulses,|13791008|54718008|260407003|54718008
loss
of peripheral sensation,|14414005|106148006|14414005|271712005|14414005|272144002
edema|423666004
and
ultimately
the death|419620001|268923008
and
loss
of affected tissues.|247591002|85756007|248448006|85756007

Vasoconstriction|32318003
is
treated|28995006
with vasodilators.[1]|372787008

Epidemics
of the disease|64572001
were
identified|7882003
throughout history,|392521001
though
the references
in classical writers|255333006|308004006|260997001|308004006
are
inconclusive.|419984006

Rye,|412068007|82011001
the main vector|63161005|260529001
for transmitting ergotism,|60117003|51510002
was
not
grown
much
around the Mediterranean.

When
Fuchs 1834 separated references|13184001|263869007
to ergotism|51510002
from erysipelas|44653001
and
other afflictions,|74964007
he
found|404684003
the earliest reference|264499004
to ergotism|51510002
in the _Annales Xantenses_
for the year 857|258707000|259039008
:
"
a Great plague|255509001|58750007|263768009|58750007
of swollen blisters|442672001|408764000|442672001|247464001
consumed
the people|125676002
by a loathsome rot,
so
that
their limbs|66019005
were
loosened|51121001
and
fell|1912002
off before death."|236874000|419620001|236874000|268923008|421718005|419620001|421718005|268923008

In the Middle Ages,|28288005
the gangrenous poisoning|372070002|75478009
was
known|36692007
as
_ignis sacer_
("holy
fire|80032004|257195008
"
)
or
"Saint Anthony's fire",|80032004|257195008
named|27468005
after monks
of the [Order
of St.

Anthony]
(/wiki/Hospital_Brothers_|70924004|285201006|70924004
of_St._Anthony
)
who
were
particularly successful|385669000
at treating|28995006
this ailment.|39104002

The 12th century chronicler Geoffroy du Breuil
of Vigeois
recorded
the mysterious outbreaks|443684005
in the Limousin region|410673009
of France,|223666001
where
the gangrenous form|372070002|246176004
of ergotism|51510002
was
associated|47429007
with the local Saint Martial|255470001
as
much
as
Saint Anthony.

According to Snorri Sturluson,
in his _Heimskringla_,
King
Magnus,
son|65616008
of King Harald Sigurtharson,
who
was
the half brother|45929001
of Saint King Olaf Haraldsson,
died|419620001|419099009
from ergotism shortly|51510002
after the Battle
of Hastings.

The blight,|399219006
named|27468005
from the cock's
spur|49620009
it
forms|246176004
on grasses,|422304003
was
identified|7882003
and
named|27468005
by Denis Dodart,|441889009
who
reported|229059009|223458004
the relation|125677006
between ergotized rye|412068007|82011001
and
bread poisoning|226559002|75478009
in a letter|126202002
to the French Royal Academy|19434008
of Sciences
in 1676
(John Ray|107315007|82107009
mentioned
ergot|55811003
for the first time|255216001|410669006|232714002|410669006
in English|297487008|25804004
the next year|18769003|258707000|18769003|259039008|255260001|258707000|255260001|259039008
)
,
but
"ergotism",|51510002
in this modern sense,|106148006
was
first|255216001|232714002
recorded
in 1853.|264645000

Notable epidemics
of ergotism|51510002
occurred|272120004
up
into the 19th century.

Fewer outbreaks|57176003|443684005
have
occurred|272120004
since then
due to rye|412068007|82011001
being
carefully
monitored|302805002|13288007
in developed countries.|223369002

A severe outbreak|24484000|443684005
of ergot poisoning|51510002
occurred|272120004
,
however,
in the French village|19434008|224806006
of Pont-Saint-Esprit
in 1951,
resulting|42752001
in five deaths.|421820001|419620001|421820001|268923008

The incident
is
described
in John Grant Fuller's book _|278212002
The Day|258703001|259032004
of St Anthony's Fire_.[3]|51510002

There
is
evidence[4]|18669006
of ergot poisoning|51510002
serving
a ritual purpose|67431008|363675004|262108006|363675004
in the ritual|67431008|262108006
killing|248007002
of certain bog bodies.[5]|17162000|279495008|17162000|123037004

When
milled|224650005
,
the ergot|55811003
is
reduced|260400001
to a red powder,|386713009|85581007|371240000|85581007
obvious
in lighter grasses|75926004|422304003
but
easy|36203004
to miss
in dark rye-flour.|255419005|229940009

In less wealthy countries,|276139006|224166006|223369002|263796003|224166006|223369002
ergotism still|51510002
occurs|272120004
;
an outbreak|443684005
in Ethiopia|223517008
occurred|272120004
in mid-2001|255562008
from contaminated barley.|62604006|2003004|62604006|20445003|62604006|278839003

Whenever
there
is
a combination|89780004
of moist weather,|17461003
cool temperatures,|246508008
delayed harvest
in lowland crops|68028003
and
rye consumption,|412068007|82011001
an outbreak|443684005
is
possible.|371930009|60022001

Poisonings|75478009
due to consumption
of seeds|264337003
treated|28995006
with mercury compounds|2376003
are
sometimes
misidentified
as ergotism.[6]|51510002

The convulsive symptoms|91175000
that
can
be
a result|394617004
of consuming ergot-tainted rye|55811003|412068007|55811003|82011001|412068007|82011001
have
also
been
said|66049007
to
be
the cause|134198009
of accusations
of bewitchment
that
spurred|49620009
the Salem witch trials.|110465008

This medical explanation|74188005
for the theory
of ?bewitchment?
is
one first|421379005|255216001|421379005|232714002
propounded
by [Linnda R.|24028007

Caporael]
(/wiki/Linnda_R._Caporael|24028007
)
in 1976
in an article
in _Science_.

In her article,
Caporael
argues
that
the convulsive symptoms,|91175000
such as crawling sensations|15037002
in the skin,|119325001|39937001|181469002
tingling|162249002
in the fingers,|7569003|259052003
vertigo,|399153001
_tinnitus aurium_,|60862001|62452009
headaches,|25064002
disturbances
in sensation,|106148006|271712005|272144002
hallucination,|7011001
painful muscular contractions,|22253000|12140005
vomiting|249497008
and
diarrhea,|398032003
as well as
psychological symptoms,|25618008
such as mania,|231494001
melancholia,
psychosis|69322001|191525009
and
delirium,|419567006
were
all symptoms
reported|229059009|223458004
in the Salem witchcraft records.|90486004

Caporael also
states|398070004
there
was
an abundance
of rye|412068007|82011001
in the region|410673009
as well as
climate
conditions|78326006|260905004
that
could
support|9096001|243114000
the tainting
of rye.|412068007|82011001

In 1982 historian Mary Matossian raised Caporael?s theory|78826004|260399008
in an article
in _American Scientist_|308027003
in which
she
argued
that symptoms
of ?bewitchment?
resemble
the ones|421379005
exhibited
in those
afflicted
with ergot poisoning.[8]|51510002

The hypothesis
that ergotism|51510002
could
explain
cases|398241000|413769002
of bewitchment
has
been
subject to
debate
and
has
been
criticized
by several scholars.|261028005

Within a year|258707000|259039008
of Caporael?s article,
the historians Spanos|78826004
and
Gottlieb
argued
against the idea|363878000
in the same journal.|262126009|433497004

In Spanos
and
Gottlieb?s rebuttal
to Caporael?s article,
they
concluded
that there
are
several flaws|261028005
in the explanation
of ergot poisoning|51510002
as a cause|134198009
of conditions|260905004
associated|47429007
with cases|398241000|413769002
of alleged bewitchment.

For example,
they
argued
that
if
the food supply|255620007|425398004
was
contaminated|62604006
,
the symptoms
would
have
occurred|272120004
on a house-|261770009|257630004
by-house basis,|261770009|261770009|418836005|257630004|257630004|418836005
not just
in particular individuals.|125676002|385435006

Historian Leon Harrier|78826004|76724004|78826004|396827005
has
challenged
this theory
by claiming
that even
if
supplies|425398004
were
properly
cooked|106373003
,
residents|405277009
suffering
from stomach ulcers|397825006
had
a risk|30207005
of absorbing
the toxin|80917008
through the stomach lining,|69695003|50009006|181246003|50009006
offering|410527000
a direct route|255589003|284009009|255589003
to the blood stream.|87612001|257709004|119273009|257709004

Being
similar
to Lysergic acid diethylamide,|15698006
the chemical composition|441900009
of the average human's stomach|278412004|69695003|278412004|181246003
would
be
too acidic|34957004
for the ergot to|55811003
survive
,
especially
if
the food|255620007
was
properly
cooked|106373003
,
but
if
some residents|405277009
were
malnourished|248325000
and
suffering
from bleeding stomach ulcers,|15902003
there
is
valid reasoning to
say|66049007
that
while
most
of the residents|405277009
would
not
be
affected|247591002|248448006
by ingesting contaminated grains,|111984006|62604006|23182003|111984006|62604006|264331002
a small percentage|255507004|118582008
could
have
become
infected
,
offering|410527000
an explanation
for
why ergotism|51510002
was
never initially|884001
recognized.

Harrier|76724004|396827005
has
even
argued
that
the numbers|410680006|410681005
could
have
been
exponentially larger, possibly even|255509001|60022001|263768009|60022001
the entire town,|255503000|288521009|260232004|288521009
but
due to the trials|110465008
on bewitchment
and
heresy,
and
the fear|1402001
of
being
accused
and
subsequently
executed
,
few
could
come
forward|255540008
while
suffering
from legitimate medical conditions.|74188005|260905004

Spanos
and
Gottlieb also
state|398070004
that ergot poisoning|51510002
has
additional symptoms|260364009
not
associated|47429007
with the events|272379006
in Salem
and
that
the proportion|8212001
of children|410601007|160499008
afflicted
were
less
than
in a typical ergotism|51510002
epidemic.

The anthropologist H.|50835006|89177007|50835006|258322007|50835006|286551008

Sidky
noted
that ergotism|51510002
had
existed
for centuries
before the Salem witch trials,|110465008
and
argued
that
its symptoms
would
have
been
recognizable
during the time|410669006
of the Salem witch trials.[10]|110465008

More horrifying|242762006
than this
were
epidemics
of poisoning,|75478009
caused|23981006|134198009
by people|125676002
eating|48263008
treated seed grains.|28995006|264337003|23182003|28995006|264337003|264331002

There
was
a serious epidemic|42745003
in Iraq|223608003
in 1956
and
again
in 1960,
whilst
use|277889008|419385000
of seed wheat|264337003|412071004|264337003|6788000|264337003|65256004|264337003
(
which
