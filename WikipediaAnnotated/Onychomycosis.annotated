(also
known|36692007
as "dermatophytic onychomycosis,|414941008
"[1] "ringworm|260305007
of the nail,|72651009|119327009
"[1]|260305007
and
"tinea unguium"[1]|414941008
)
means fungal infection|255586005|3218000
of the nail.|72651009|119327009

It
is
the most common disease|4757001|72906007|64572001
of the nails|72651009
and
constitutes
about a half
of all nail abnormalities.[3]|72651009|276654001|119327009|276654001

This condition|260905004
may
affect|4065008
toenails|76578001
or
fingernails,|91456000
but
toenail infections|76578001
are
particularly common.|72906007

The prevalence
of onychomycosis|414941008
is
about 6-8%
in the adult population.[4]|133936004|385436007|133936004|389109008

There
are
four classic types|421534005|255301002|261664005|421534005|255333006|261664005
of onychomycosis|414941008
:
[5]|264706000|264605009

The most common symptom|4757001|72906007
of a fungal nail infection|414941008
is
the nail|72651009|119327009
becoming
thickened|263899003
and
discoloured|47415006
:
white,|413773004|185984009|371251000
black,|315240009|413464008|15086000|371252007
yellow|263935005
or
green.|371246006

As the infection
progresses|385651009
the nail|72651009|119327009
can
become
brittle,|255299009
with pieces
breaking
off
or
coming away
from the toe|29707007|302547009
or
finger completely.|7569003|302541005

If
left untreated,|7771000|25265005
the skin|119325001|39937001|181469002
can
become
inflamed
and
painful|22253000
underneath
and
around the nail.|72651009|119327009

There
may
also
be
white|413773004|185984009|371251000
or
yellow patches|263935005|36875001
on the nailbed|56820002|181578005
or
scaly skin next to|271761007|18769003
the nail.|72651009|119327009

[7] There
is
usually
no pain|22253000
or
other bodily symptoms,|74964007
unless
the disease|64572001
is
severe.|24484000

People|125676002
with onychomycosis|414941008
may
experience
significant psychosocial problems|386134007|55607006
due to the appearance|386548000|255412001
of the nail,|72651009|119327009
particularly
when
fingers ?|7569003|259052003
which
are
always visible ?|24054004
rather than
toenails|76578001
are
affected.[9]|247591002|248448006

Dermatophytids|30668009
are
fungus-free skin lesions|414561005|37837009|95324001
that sometimes
form|246176004
as a result|394617004
of a fungus infection|3218000
in another part|260726005
of the body.|279495008|123037004

This
could
take|419652001
the form|246176004
of a rash|271807003
or
itch|424492005
in an area|42798000
of the body|279495008|123037004
that
is
not
infected
with the fungus.|414561005

Dermatophytids|30668009
can
be
thought|88952004
of
as
an allergic reaction|421961002
to the fungus.|414561005

The causative pathogens|264418008
of onychomycosis|414941008
include|55919000
dermatophytes,|416959009
_Candida_,|3265006
and
nondermatophytic molds.|84489001

Dermatophytes|416959009
are
the fungi most commonly responsible|414561005|394851003
for onychomycosis|414941008
in the temperate western countries|223369002
;
while
_Candida_|3265006
and
nondermatophytic molds|84489001
are
more frequently|242762006|70232002
involved|248448006
in the tropics
and
subtropics
with a hot|264018002
and
humid climate.[10]|17461003

_Trichophyton rubrum_|372008|411836003

A common outdated name|72906007
that
may
still
be
reported|229059009|223458004
by medical laboratories|74188005|261904005
is
_Trichophyton mentagrophytes_|55766005|1885007
for _T.

interdigitale_.

The name _T.

mentagrophytes_
is
now
restricted|263856008
to the agent|260872001
of favus skin infection|85375000|108365000
of the mouse|447612001|447482001
;
though
this fungus|414561005
may
be
transmitted|60117003|258150004
from mice|447612001|447482001
and
their danders|45073000
to humans,|278412004
it generally
infects
skin|119325001|39937001|181469002
and
not nails.|72651009

Other causative pathogens|74964007|264418008
include|55919000
_Candida_|3265006
and
nondermatophytic molds,|84489001
in particular members|394852005
of the mold generation _Scytalidium_|84489001|12678008
(name recently|6493001
changed|243326001|263703002
to _Neoscytalidium_
)
,
_Scopulariopsis_,|39949000
and
_Aspergillus_.|2429008

_Candida_ spp.|3265006

mainly
cause|23981006|134198009
fingernail onychomycosis|91456000|414941008
in people|125676002
whose
hands|85562004
are
often|70232002
submerged
in water.|11713004|119318008

_Scytalidium_ mainly|12678008
affects|4065008
people|125676002
in the tropics,
though
it
persists
if
they later
move|302000008|384598002|370125004
to areas|42798000
of temperate climate.

Other molds more commonly|74964007|84489001
affect|4065008
people|125676002
older|70753007
than 60 years,|258707000
and
their presence|386397008
in the nail|72651009|119327009
reflects|225436004
a slight weakening|255510006|255604002
in the nail's ability to|72651009|371150009|119327009|371150009
defend
itself
against fungal invasion.|414561005|370052007

Aging|248280005
is
the most common risk factor|4757001|72906007|80943009
for onychomycosis|414941008
due to diminished blood circulation,|1250004|87612001|413854007|1250004|119273009|413854007
longer exposure|255511005|71677004|255511005|24932003
to fungi,|414561005
and
nails|72651009
which
grow
more slowly|242762006|419443000
and
thicken,|263899003
increasing|260369004
susceptibility|76522002|118588007
to infection.

Nail fungus|414941008
tends
to
affect|4065008
men more often|339947000|70232002
than women,|224526002
and
is
associated|47429007
with a family history|57177007
of this infection

Other risk factors|74964007|80943009
include|55919000
perspiring|161857006
heavily,
being
in a humid|17461003
or
moist environment,|17461003|276339004
psoriasis,|9014002
wearing
socks|262156000
and
shoes|43983001
that hinder ventilation|258162000|45444009
and
do
not absorb perspiration,|74616000|161857006
going
barefoot|111960003
in damp public places|17461003|257557008
such as swimming pools,|257712001
gyms
and
shower rooms,|224704001
having
athlete's foot|6020002
(tinea pedis|6020002
)
,
minor skin|410599005|119325001|410599005|39937001|410599005|181469002|255606000|119325001|255606000|39937001|255606000|181469002
or
nail injury,|275320004
damaged nail,|247503008
or
other infection,|74964007
and
having
diabetes,|73211009
circulation problems|413854007|55607006
or
a weakened immune system.[11]|116003000

To
avoid
misdiagnosis
as nail psoriasis,|238604005
lichen planus,|4776004
contact dermatitis,|40275004
trauma,
nail bed tumor|56820002|108369006|181578005|108369006
or
yellow nail syndrome,|400211001
laboratory confirmation|261904005|74996004
may
be
necessary.

The three main approaches|421291004|63161005|421291004|63161005|103379005
are
potassium hydroxide smear,|34763001
culture|252398009|61594008
and
histology.|67151002

This
involves|248448006
microscopic examination|117259009
and
culture|252398009|61594008
of nail scrapings|72651009|258431006|119327009|258431006
or
clippings.|21147007|360017003

Recent results|6493001|394617004
indicate|410535002
the most sensitive diagnostic approaches|4757001|83185005|439401001|4757001|83185005|439401001|103379005|4757001|83185005|261004008|4757001|83185005|261004008|103379005
are
direct smear|255589003
combined|89780004
with histological examination,|67151002|5880005
[12]
and
nail plate biopsy|72651009|86273004
using|260676000
periodic acid-Schiff stain.|15947002|255808002|104216002

To reliably
identify|7882003
nondermatophyte molds,|84489001
several samples|261028005|123038009
may
be
necessary.[14]

Treatment|276239002|416118004
of onychomycosis|414941008
is
challenging
because
the infection
is
embedded
within the nail|72651009|119327009
and
is
difficult to|52925006
reach|282679008
;
full removal|261015003|118292001|261015003|128303001
of symptoms
is
slow|419443000
and
may
take|419652001
a year|258707000|259039008
or
more.|242762006

Most treatments|276239002
are
either
systemic antifungal medications,|31099001|373219008|410942007
such as terbinafine|373450007
and
itraconazole,|387532006
or
topical,|359540000
such as nail paints|72651009|36864000|119327009|36864000
containing|42504009
ciclopirox|372854000
(ciclopiroxolamine|70169009
)
or
amorolfine.|391769002

There
is
evidence|18669006
that combining|89780004|20909006
systemic|31099001
and
topical treatments|276239002|359540000|276239002
is
beneficial.[15]

For superficial white onychomycosis,|417583002
systemic|31099001
rather than
topical antifungal therapy|373219008|276239002|359540000|373219008|276239002
is
advised.[16]|424900004

In July 2007
a meta-study|110465008|224699009
reported|229059009|223458004

the efficacy
and
safety

in comparison
to placebo,
itraconazole|387532006
and
griseofulvin|372807004
in treating fungal infections|28995006|3218000
of the nails.|72651009

The main findings|63161005|404684003|63161005
were
for reduced fungus,|260400001|414561005
terbinafine|373450007
was
found|404684003
to
be
significantly better|3442003
than itraconazole|387532006
and
griseofulvin,|372807004
and
terbinafine|373450007
was
better|3442003
