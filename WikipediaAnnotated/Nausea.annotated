(Latin _nausea_,|422587007
from Greek ??????,|1451003
_nausi?_,
"motion sickness",|37031009
"feeling sick,|422587007
" "queasy"|422587007
or
"wamble"[1]
)
is
a sensation|106148006|271712005|272144002
of unease|247806005
and
discomfort|367391008|87128005
in the upper stomach|261183002|69695003|261183002|181246003
with an involuntary urge
to vomit.|249497008|1985008

It often,|70232002
but
not always,
precedes|236874000
vomiting.|249497008

A person|125676002
can
suffer
nausea|422587007
without vomiting.|249497008

(Greek ????|1451003
= "ship"|224673002
; ??????
started|385652002
as meaning "seasickness".|18530007
)

Nausea|422587007
is
a non-specific symptom,|10003008
which means|255586005
that
it
has
many possible causes.|371930009|134198009|60022001|134198009

Some common causes|72906007|134198009
of nausea|422587007
are
motion sickness,|37031009
dizziness,|404640003|399153001
migraine,|37796009
fainting|271594007
,
gastroenteritis|25374005
(stomach infection|69695003|181246003
)
or
food poisoning.|75258004

Side effects
of many medications|410942007
including|55919000
cancer chemotherapy,|367336001
nauseants
or
morning sickness|51885006
in early pregnancy.|264499004|289908002

Nausea|422587007
may
also
be
caused|23981006|134198009
by anxiety,|48694002|197480006
disgust
and
depression.[3][4][5]|35489007|366979004|255339005

Medications|410942007
taken|419652001
to
prevent
nausea|422587007
are
called
antiemetics|372764000
and
include|55919000
diphenhydramine,|372682005
metoclopramide|372776000
and
ondansetron.|372487007

There
are
many causes|260396001|134198009
of nausea.|422587007

One organization|421379005|21139007
listed
700
in 2009.

Gastrointestinal infections|128398001
(37%
)
and
food poisoning|75258004
are
the two most common causes.|420797005|72906007|134198009

While
side effects
from medications|410942007
(3%|260313008
)
and
pregnancy|289908002
are
also relatively frequent.|70232002

In 10%
of people|125676002
the cause remains|134198009
unknown.[7]|261665006

Food poisoning usually|75258004
causes|134198009
an abrupt onset|255363002
of nausea|422587007
and
vomiting one|249497008|421379005
to six hours|422218008|258702006
after ingestion|111984006
of contaminated food|228034007
and
lasts
for one|421379005
to two days.|420797005|258703001

It
is
due to toxins|80917008
produced
by bacteria|409822003
in food.[8]|255620007

Many medications|260396001|410942007
can
potentially
cause|23981006|134198009
nausea.|422587007

Some
of the most frequently|4757001|70232002
associated|47429007
include|55919000
cancer|363346000|372087000
and
system chemotherapy regimens|246333005|367336001
and
general anaesthetic agents.|373288007

Nausea|422587007
or
"morning sickness"|51885006
is
common|72906007
during early pregnancy|264499004|289908002
but
may
occasionally
continue|255238004
into the second|81170007|257997001|288495006
and
third trimesters.|255248002

In the first trimester nearly 80%|255246003
of women|224526002
have
some degree|258395000|246173007
of nausea.|422587007

Pregnancy|289908002
should
therefore
be
considered
as a possible cause|371930009|134198009|60022001|134198009
of nausea|422587007
in any women|224526002
of child bearing age.|410601007|106970005|424144002|410601007|81827009|424144002|410601007|398209006|424144002|160499008|106970005|424144002|160499008|81827009|424144002|160499008|398209006|424144002

While
usually
it
is
mild|255604002
and
self-limiting severe cases|255469002|24484000|398241000|255469002|24484000|413769002
known|36692007
as hyperemesis gravidarum|14094001
may
require
treatment.[10]|276239002|416118004

A number|410680006|410681005
of conditions|260905004
involving|248448006
balance|249982003|78933003|282295000
such as motion sickness|37031009
and
vertigo|399153001
can
lead|88488004
to nausea|422587007
and
vomiting.|249497008

Nausea|422587007
may
be
caused|23981006|134198009
by stress|262188008
and
depression.[3][4][5]|35489007|366979004|255339005

While
most
causes|134198009
of nausea|422587007
are
not serious,|42745003
some serious causes|42745003|134198009
do
occur.|272120004

These
include|55919000
:
diabetic ketoacidosis,|420422005
brain tumor,|126952004
surgical problems,|83578000|55607006
heart attack,|22298006
[11] pancreatitis,|75694006
small bowel obstruction,|281255004
meningitis,|7180009
appendicitis,|74400008|85189001
cholecystitis,|76581006
Addisonian crisis,|24867002
Choledocholithiasis
(
from gallstones|266474003|256896000|235919008
)
and
hepatitis,|128241005|40468003|396423004
as
a sign|72670004
of carbon monoxide poison
and
many others.[2]|260396001

Often|70232002
no investigations|386053000
are
needed|410525008|103325001
,
however basic lab tests|261904005|269814003|261904005|272393004|418836005|261904005|269814003|418836005|261904005|272393004
may
be
appropriate.

If
a bowel obstruction|81060008
is
possible, abdominal x-rays|371930009|60654006|60022001|60654006
may
be
useful.[2]

If dehydration|34095006
is
present|52101004|246105001
due to loss
of fluids|32457005|33463005
from severe vomiting|24484000|249497008
and/or
accompanying diarrhea,|398032003
rehydration|243221009
with oral electrolyte solutions|412457002
is
preferred.|225773000

If
this
is
not effective|255403003|254648000
or
possible, intravenous rehydration|371930009|243221009|371930009|255560000|243221009|60022001|243221009|60022001|255560000|243221009
may
be
required.[2]

Dimenhydrinate|387469006
(Gravol
)
is
an inexpensive
and
effective medication|255403003|410942007|254648000|410942007
for preventing postoperative nausea|64581007|116699007|64581007
and
vomiting.|249497008

Meclozine|372879002
is
another antihistamine|372806008|373228009
antiemetic.|372764000

In certain people,|17162000|125676002
cannabinoids|421921003
may
be
effective|255403003|254648000
in reducing chemotherapy|260400001|416608005|260400001|367336001
associated|47429007
nausea|422587007
and
vomiting.|249497008

Ondansetron|372487007
(Zofran
)
is
effective|255403003|254648000
for nausea|422587007
and
vomiting|249497008
but
is
expensive.

Pyridoxine|430469009|11829003
or
metoclopramide|372776000
are
the first line treatments|255216001|50009006|276239002|232714002|50009006|276239002
for pregnancy|289908002
related|272151006|262094002
nausea|422587007
and
vomiting.|249497008

Medical marijuana|74188005|74188005|398705004|74188005|228998006|74188005|10083006
may
be
prescribed
where
allowed
for certain indications.|17162000|410666004

While
short-term nausea|422587007
and
vomiting|249497008
are
generally harmless,
they
may
sometimes
indicate|410535002
a more serious condition.|242762006|42745003|260905004

When
associated|47429007
with prolonged vomiting,|255224006|249497008
it
may
lead|88488004
to dehydration|34095006
and/or
dangerous electrolyte imbalances.|105593004

Repeated intentional vomiting,|27582007|361269008|249497008
characteristic
of bulimia,
can
cause|23981006|134198009
stomach acid to|312314007
wear
away
at the enamel|76993005
in teeth.[15]|66303006

Nausea|422587007
and or
vomiting|249497008
is
the main complaint|63161005|409586006
in 1.6%|260305007
of visits
to family physicians|62247001
in Australia.|223621005

However only 25%
of people|125676002
with nausea|422587007
visit
their family physician.|62247001

It
is
most common|4757001|72906007
in those 15?24 years|258707000
old|70753007
and
less common|276139006|72906007|263796003|72906007
in other ages.[7]|74964007|424144002
