is
a spectrum
of disorders|64572001
due to environmental heat exposure.|276339004|418611001

It
includes|55919000
minor conditions|410599005|260905004|255606000|260905004
such as heat cramps,|87108006
heat syncope,|89797005
and
heat exhaustion|95868006
as well as
the more severe condition|242762006|24484000|260905004
known|36692007
as heat stroke.|52072009

*
*Heat stroke|52072009
*
*
is
defined
as a body temperature|105723007
of greater|263768009
than 40.6 ?C|259031006
(105.1 ?F)|372639009
due to environmental heat exposure|276339004|418611001
with lack|41277001
of thermoregulation.|386726008

This
is
distinct
from a fever,|386661006
where there
is
a physiological increase|1360005|260366006
in the temperature set point|105723007|246508008
of the body.|279495008|123037004

Treatment|276239002|416118004
involves|248448006
rapid physical cooling.|255358001|5880005|255358001|19388002

A number|410680006|410681005
of heat illnesses|88999006|39104002
exist
including|55919000
[2][3]|260306008
:

Heat stroke|52072009
presents|52101004|246105001
with a hyperthermia|386661006|50177009
of greater|263768009
than 40.6 ?C|259031006
(105.1 ?F)|372639009
in combination|89780004
with confusion|286933003
and
a lack|41277001
of sweating.[5]|161857006

Substances|105590001
that
inhibit|61511001
cooling
and
cause dehydration|134198009|34095006
such as alcohol,|419442005|53041004|430837008
caffeine,|255641001
stimulants,|373333006
medications,|410942007
and
age-related physiological changes|424144002|272151006|1360005|243326001|424144002|272151006|1360005|263703002|424144002|262094002|1360005|243326001|424144002|262094002|1360005|263703002
predispose
to so-called "classic" heat stroke.|255301002|52072009|255333006|52072009

Exertional heat stroke|19487008|52072009
can
happen
in young people|84422007|125676002
without health problems|263775005|55607006
or
medications,|410942007
most often|70232002
in athletes
and
military recruits.|302314004

Children,|410601007|160499008
elderly adults,|105436006|133936004
or
disabled individuals|125676002|385435006
left|7771000
alone|105529008
in a vehicle|412307009|261324000
are
at particular risk|30207005
of succumbing
to heat stroke,|52072009
even
with windows partially|224755008
open.|56116003

As these groups|261586004|160481000
of individuals|125676002|385435006
may
not
be
able to|371150009
express
discomfort verbally|367391008|87128005
(
or
audibly,
inside a closed car|29179001|71783008
)
,
their plight
may
not
be
immediately|49499008
noticed
by others|74964007
in the vicinity.

A stuffed toy|91032009
or
other child's toy|74964007|410601007|91032009|74964007|160499008|91032009

recommended
for a parent|40683002
or
guardian to|58626002|394619001

present.|52101004|246105001

For larger groups,|255509001|261586004|255509001|160481000|263768009|261586004|263768009|160481000
checking|360160009
the van|224832000
or
bus|22674006
for stragglers
at the end|261782000|422117008
of the trip|75941004
is
essential,|34325006
complemented|20823009
by other procedures|74964007|71388002
such as a head count.[6]|69536005|258734002|302548004|258734002

Pets
are
even more susceptible|131196009
than humans|278412004
to heat stroke|52072009
in cars,|71783008
as
dogs|448771007
(
the animals usually|387961004
involved|248448006
)
,
cats|448169003|388618001
and
many other animals|74964007|387961004
cannot
produce
whole body sweat.|261188006|74616000|261188006|161857006

Non-guide dogs|106384005|448771007|106384005|303479009|448771007|303479009
are
prohibited
from
being
brought|68369002
into many establishments,
and
opening|56116003
a vehicle window sufficiently|412307009|224755008|412307009|385673002|261324000|224755008|261324000|385673002
may
present|52101004|246105001
an escape opportunity
or

Leaving|7771000|90737002
the pet
at home|261770009
with plenty
of water|11713004|119318008
on hot days|264018002|258703001
is
recommended instead,
or
,
if
a dog|448771007
must
be
brought|68369002
along,
tied|228197000
up
outside the destination
and
provided
with a full water bowl.[7]|261015003|11713004|40376000|261015003|119318008|40376000

Between 1998
and
2011,
at least 500 children|276139006|410601007|276139006|160499008|263796003|410601007|263796003|160499008
in the United States|223688001
died|419620001|419099009
from
being
inside hot cars,|264018002|71783008
and
75%
of them
were
less
than 2 years old.|260306008|258707000|70753007

When
the
outside temperature|105723007|246508008
is
70 degrees Fahrenheit|258712004
(21.1?C
)
,
the temperature|105723007|246508008
inside the car|71783008
can
exceed
120 degrees|246173007
(48.8?C
)
,
even
when
the windows|224755008
are
partially
open.[8]|56116003

Legal prosecution|11418007
of parents|40683002
in this situation
varies
greatly.

For example,
after
a college professor|224864007
in California|224043007|25997004
and
a horse trainer|35354009|228239008|388441000|228239008|388445009|228239008
in Florida|224048003
each unintentionally
killed|248007002
their child|410601007|160499008
in a hot car,|264018002|71783008
the college professor|224864007
was
never
prosecuted
,
but
the horse trainer|35354009|228239008|388441000|228239008|388445009|228239008
was
sentenced
to 20 years|258707000
in prison.[9]|257656006

Among all child deaths|105444006
in hot cars,|264018002|71783008
slightly more|425404009
than half
occur|272120004
because
parents|40683002
forget
that
the child|410601007|160499008
is
in the car,|71783008
18% happen
after parents intentionally|40683002
leave|7771000|90737002
the child|410601007|160499008
in a car|71783008
without understanding|66216009
how hot|264018002
it
can
get
,
and
30% happen
after the child|410601007|160499008
had
climbed|284097000
into the car to|71783008
play.[10]|300776002

Forgotten baby syndrome (FBS)|418119000
is
a pseudo-medical term|64100000|74188005
for the danger
of adult caregivers|133936004|133932002
forgetting
about the presence|386397008
of a child|410601007|160499008
and
consequently
subjecting
the child|410601007|160499008
to danger.

In spite of the word "syndrome"|255373000
this
is
not
a recognized medical condition|74188005|260905004
;
however
the term
has
achieved
some currency|15240007
in newspapers,
magazines,
blogs,
and
other popular media.[11][12]|74964007|61695000

The risk|30207005
of heatstroke|52072009
can
be
reduced|260400001
by observing precautions to
avoid
overheating
and
dehydration.|34095006

Light,|56242006|371268001
loose-fitting clothing|78799005|272180002|78799005|122467006|272180002
will
allow
perspiration|74616000|161857006
to evaporate
and
cool
the body.|279495008|123037004

Wide-brimmed hats|90522003|261368003
in light colours|371268001
keep
the sun|49926000
from warming
the head|69536005|302548004
and
neck|45048000|302550007
and
block|26036001|112232007
the powerful radiation|33300005|30821001|33300005|82107009|33300005|108290001
from hurting
the eyes|81745001
;
vents
on a hat|261368003
will
allow
perspiration to|74616000|161857006
cool
the head.|69536005|302548004

Strenuous exercise|61686008
should
be
avoided
during daylight hours|258702006
in hot weather|57955009
;
so|223528007
should
remaining
in enclosed spaces|68947003
(
such as automobiles|71783008
).

The temperature|105723007|246508008
inside cars|71783008
can
reach|282679008
200?F (c.|372639009

93?C
)
at the right exterior temperature,|24028007|105723007|24028007|246508008
sunlight,|49926000
color|263714004
of vehicle,|412307009|261324000
and
type|261664005
of vehicle.|412307009|261324000

Temperatures|246508008
that high,|75540009|371879000
without proper cooling,
could
be
dangerous
and
even fatal, especially|399166001
with young children|84422007|410601007|84422007|160499008
and
pets.[14]

In environments|276339004
that
are
not only hot|264018002
but
also humid,|17461003
it
is
important to
recognize
that humidity|3525006
reduces|260400001
the degree|258395000|246173007
to which
the body|279495008|123037004
can
lose
heat|88999006
by evaporation.

In such environments,|276339004
it
helps
to
wear
light clothing|56242006|272180002|371268001|272180002
such as cotton|51627003|91299008|54000004|256246007
in light colors,|371268001
that
is
pervious to|82540007
sweat|74616000|161857006
but
impervious
to radiant heat|285337003
from the sun.|49926000

This minimises
the gaining|35105006|255396000|260366006|260369004|398092000
of radiant heat,|285337003
while
allowing
as much evaporation to
occur|272120004
as the environment|276339004
will
allow.

Clothing|272180002
such as plastic fabrics|61088005|256245006
that
are
impermeable to
sweat|74616000|161857006
and
thus
do
not
facilitate
heat loss|88999006
through evaporation
can
actually
contribute
to heat stress.[15]|88999006|262188008

In hot weather people|57955009|125676002
need|410525008|103325001
to
drink|226465004
plenty
of liquids to|33463005
replace|282089006|370124000
fluids|32457005|33463005
lost
from sweating.|161857006

Thirst|59299002
is
not
a reliable
sign|72670004
that
a person|125676002
needs|410525008|103325001
fluids.|32457005|33463005

A better indicator|3442003
is
the color|263714004
of urine.|78014005

A dark yellow color|255419005|263935005|255419005|263935005|255419005|90998002
may
indicate|410535002
dehydration.|34095006

The Occupational Safety|87923000
and
Health Administration|394867009
in the United States|223688001
publishes
a heat stress Quick Card [17]|88999006|262188008|255358001
that
contains|42504009
a checklist
designed
to
help
prevent
heat stress.|88999006|262188008

This list,
known|36692007
as the KBUDWA list,
includes|55919000
:

Treatment|276239002|416118004
involves|248448006
rapid mechanical cooling|255358001|261018001
along
with standard resuscitation measures.[18]|439569004|246445000|439569004|367346004

The body temperature|105723007
must
be
lowered|261122009|385440003
immediately.|49499008

The patient|116154003
should
be
moved|384598002|370125004
to a cool area|42798000
(indoors,
or
at least
in the shade
)
and
clothing|272180002
removed|127485006
to
promote
heat loss|88999006
(passive cooling
).

Active cooling methods|55561003|260686004|55561003|272394005
may
be
used|394850002
:
The person|125676002
is
bathed|129002005|60369001
in cool water|11713004|119318008
or
a hyperthermia vest|386661006|228202007|386661006|415773002|50177009|228202007|50177009|415773002
can
be
applied.|410618006

However,
wrapping|262318008
the patient|116154003
in wet towels|17461003|54638004
or
clothes|272180002
can
actually
act
as insulation
and
increase|260366006
the body temperature.|105723007

Cold compresses|285686007|37204000|82272006|37204000|84162001|37204000
to the torso,|22943007
head,|69536005|302548004
neck,|45048000|302550007
and
groin|255575008
will
help
cool
the victim.

A fan|261259003
or
dehumidifying air conditioning unit|417696007|78326006|258666001
may
be
used|394850002
to
aid|246088000
in evaporation
of the water|11713004|119318008
(evaporative method|260686004|272394005
).

a patient|116154003
into a bathtub|75988000
of cool
(

)
is
a recognized method|260686004|272394005
of cooling.

This method|260686004|272394005
requires
the effort|19487008
of 4-5 people|264676006|125676002
and
the patient|116154003
should
be
monitored|302805002|13288007
carefully
during the treatment process.|276239002|415178003|416118004|415178003

Immersion|19674006
should
be
avoided
for an unconscious patient,|418107008|116154003
but
if there
is
no alternative,
the patient's head|116154003|69536005|116154003|302548004
must
be
held|421139008
above water.|261183002|11713004|261183002|119318008

Immersion|19674006
in very cold water|260358002|285686007|11713004|260358002|285686007|119318008|260358002|82272006|11713004|260358002|82272006|119318008|260358002|84162001|11713004|260358002|84162001|119318008
is
counterproductive,
as
it
causes|134198009
vasoconstriction|32318003
in the skin|119325001|39937001|181469002
and
thereby
prevents|116699007
heat|88999006
from escaping
the body core.|279495008|260235002|123037004|260235002

This hypothesis however
has
been
challenged
in experimental studies,|110465008|224699009
[19][20]
as well as
by systematic reviews|415300000
of the clinical data[21][22]|58147004
indicating|410535002
that cutaneous vasoconstriction|119325001|32318003|39937001|32318003|181469002|32318003
and
shivering thermogenesis
do
not
play|300776002
a dominant role
in the radiant decrease|260400001|260370003
in core body temperature|276885007
brought|68369002
on
by cold water immersion.|285686007|11713004|19674006|285686007|119318008|19674006|82272006|11713004|19674006|82272006|119318008|19674006|84162001|11713004|19674006|84162001|119318008|19674006

This effect|253861007
can
be
seen
in the effect|253861007
of
(non-therapeutic|262202000
)
submersion hypothermia,|19674006|386689009|19674006|241970005
where
the body temperature decrease|105723007|260400001|105723007|260370003
is
directly
related|272151006|262094002
to environmental temperature,|276339004|105723007|276339004|246508008
and
though
bodily
defenses
slow|419443000
the decrease|260400001|260370003
in temperature|105723007|246508008
for a time,|410669006
they ultimately
fail
to
maintain|385630006
endothermic homeostasis.|21979002

Dantrolene,|372819007
a direct-acting paralytic, abolishes shuddering|255589003
and
is
effective|255403003|254648000
in many other forms|74964007|246176004
of hyperthermia,|386661006|50177009
including|55919000
centrally-,
peripherally-
and
cellularly-mediated thermogenesis,|73510009
has
no individual|125676002|385435006
or
additive effects|260364009|253861007
to cooling
in the context|263491009
of heatstroke,|52072009
[23]|264657009
showing
a lack|41277001
of endogenous thermogenic response|73979006|88999006
to cold water immersion.|285686007|11713004|19674006|285686007|119318008|19674006|82272006|11713004|19674006|82272006|119318008|19674006|84162001|11713004|19674006|84162001|119318008|19674006

Thus,
aggressive ice-water immersion|61372001|896008|11713004|19674006|61372001|896008|119318008|19674006|896008|11713004|19674006|896008|119318008|19674006
remains
the gold standard|2309006|371256005
for life-threatening heatstroke._[citation|224130005|52072009

Hydration|405006006
is
of paramount importance
in cooling
the patient.|116154003

In mild cases|255604002|398241000|255604002|413769002
of concomitant dehydration,|79970003|34095006
this
can
achieved
by drinking water|160573003|11713004|160573003|119318008|30953006|11713004|30953006|119318008
or
Commercial isotonic drinks|226499001
may
be
used|394850002
as a substitute.

In exercise-|61686008
or
heat-induced dehydration,|88999006|16404004|34095006
electrolyte derangement|86355000
can
result|394617004
,
and
may

Hyponatremia|89627008
can
be
corrected|370975003
by intake
of hypertonic fluids.|32457005|33463005

Absorption
is
rapid|255358001
and
complete|255594003
in most patients,|116154003
but
if
the patient|116154003
is
confused,|286933003
unconscious,|418107008
or
unable to|371151008
tolerate
oral fluid,|260548002|32457005|260548002|33463005|260548002|255765007|260548002

(
via a drip
)
may
be
necessary.

The patient's condition|116154003|260905004
should
be
reassessed
and
stabilized|409051000
by trained medical personnel.|118629009|62193008

The patient's heart rate|116154003|364075005
and
breathing|14910006|258162000
should
be
monitored|302805002|13288007
,
and
CPR|89666000
may
be
necessary
if
the patient goes|116154003
into cardiac arrest.|397829000

It
is
widely
believed
that heat stroke|52072009
leads|88488004|236874000
only rarely|50607009|103356009|420295001|103356009
to permanent deficits|6934004|260372006
and
the convalescence|105499002
is
almost
complete.|255594003

American researchers
from the University of Chicago Medical Centre|405608006
followed|367409002
58 subjects
chosen
from more|242762006
than 3,000 patients|260313008|116154003
with heat-related conditions|88999006|272151006|260905004|88999006|262094002|260905004
who
were
admitted|32485007
to Chicago area hospitals|42798000
between July 12
and
July 20,
1995.

All 58 subjects experienced symptoms
of near-fatal heat stroke.|277752003|399166001|52072009

Each
was
interviewed
at the time|410669006
of their discharge|307488001|58000006
from the hospital,|285201006
with a follow up interview|308273005
scheduled|416151008|416774000
one year later.|421379005|258707000|421379005|259039008

Subjects
ranged
in age|424144002
from 25
to 95,
with the average age|424144002
of the group|261586004|160481000|389109008
being
around 67.

The study also|110465008|224699009
recognized
the fact
that
because of overcrowded conditions|260905004
in all
of the participating hospitals
during this crisis,|32937002
the immediate care ?|88694003|49499008
which
is
critical ?
was
not
as comprehensive
as
it
should
have
been
,
underlining
how important
it
is
to quickly
seek
medical attention|74188005|6769007
when
the first signs|276131009
occur.|272120004

However,
in addition|260364009
to the pre-hospital deaths,|236874000|16983000|272113006|16983000
nearly half
of the patients|116154003
admitted|32485007
to Chicago-area ICUs|42798000|309904001
for heat stroke|52072009
died|419620001|419099009
within a year?21 percent|258707000|118582008|259039008|118582008
before discharge|307488001|58000006
and
another 28 percent|118582008
after release|58000006|68776005|258760001|129299003|115956009
from the hospital.|285201006

Many
of the survivors
suffered
permanent loss|6934004
of independent function|371153006|246464006
;
one-third|421379005|70905002
had
severe functional impairment|24484000|40143009|40226000|24484000|246464006|40226000
at discharge,|307488001|58000006
and
none|260413007
of them
had
improved|385425000|3442003
after one year.[24]|421379005|258707000|421379005|259039008
