is
a semi-autonomous, convulsive expulsion|72167002|118636005|72167002|91175000|118636005
of air|417696007
from the lungs|39607008
through the nose|260540009|181195007
and
mouth,|74262004|123851003|21082005|181220002
usually
caused|23981006|134198009
by foreign particles
irritating
the nasal mucosa.|34508005|310211009

A sneeze expels air forcibly|162367006|417696007
from the mouth|74262004|123851003|21082005|181220002
and
nose|260540009|181195007
in an explosive, spasmodic involuntary action resulting chiefly|66113009|45352006|129264002|42752001
from irritation|257553007
of the nasal mucous membrane.|34508005|310211009

Sneezing|162367006
is
possibly|60022001
linked
to sudden exposure|255363002|71677004|255363002|24932003
to bright light,|221668007|56242006|221668007|371268001
sudden change|255363002|243326001|255363002|263703002
(fall|1912002
)
in temperature,|105723007|246508008
breeze
of cold air,|256234008
a particularly full stomach,|261015003|69695003|261015003|181246003
or
viral infection,|34014006
and
can
lead|88488004
to the
spread|410677005
of disease.|64572001

The function|246464006
of sneezing|162367006
is
to expel mucus|49909006
containing|42504009
foreign particles
or
irritants|412453003
and
cleanse
the nasal cavity.|279549004|263481003

During a sneeze,|162367006
the soft palate|49460000|245784004
and
uvula depress|26140008|366979004
while
the
back of the tongue|21974007|181226008
elevates|75540009
to partially
close|29179001
the passage|255592004
to the mouth|74262004|123851003|21082005|181220002
so
that air|417696007
ejected
from the lungs|39607008
may
be
expelled
through the nose.|260540009|181195007

Because
the closing|29179001
of the mouth|74262004|123851003|21082005|181220002
is
partial,|255609007
a considerable amount|107651007
of this air|417696007
is
usually also
expelled
from the mouth.|74262004|123851003|21082005|181220002

The force|285653008
and
extent|255590007
of the expulsion|118636005
of the air|417696007
through the nose|260540009|181195007
varies.

Sneezing typically|162367006
occurs|272120004
when
foreign particles
or
sufficient external stimulants|51117008|261074009|373333006
pass
through the nasal hairs to|260540009|386045008|386045008
reach|282679008
the nasal mucosa.|34508005|310211009

This
triggers
the release|58000006|68776005|258760001|129299003|115956009
of histamines,|54235008
which
irritate
the nerve cells|47220008
in the nose,|260540009|181195007
resulting|42752001
in signals
being
sent
to the brain to|12738006|258335003
initiate
the sneeze|162367006
through the trigeminal nerve network.|27612005

The brain then|12738006|258335003
relates|272151006|262094002
this initial signal,|884001|232714002
activates
the pharyngeal|54066008
and
tracheal muscles|64292007|197333002
and
creates
a large opening|255509001|56116003
of the nasal|260540009
and
oral cavities,|74262004|181220002
resulting|42752001
in a powerful release|33300005|58000006|33300005|68776005|33300005|258760001|33300005|129299003|33300005|115956009
of air|417696007
and
bioparticles.

The powerful nature|33300005|277302009
of a sneeze|162367006
is
attributed|246061005
to its involvement|248448006
of numerous organs|260396001|410653004
of the upper body ?|128262006
it
is
a reflexive response
involving|248448006
the face,|89545001|302549007
throat,|54066008|49928004|264231000
and
chest muscles.|15187006

Sneezing|162367006
is
also
triggered|410658008
by sinus nerve stimulation|428794004|3057000|122545008|428794004|256864008|122545008|2095001|3057000|122545008|2095001|256864008|122545008
caused|23981006|134198009
by nasal congestion|68235000
and
allergies.|421961002

Other than irritating foreign particles,
allergies|421961002
or
possible illness,|371930009|39104002|60022001|39104002
another stimulus|8927009
is
sudden exposure|255363002|71677004|255363002|24932003
to bright light -|221668007|56242006|221668007|371268001
a condition|260905004
known|36692007
as photic sneeze reflex.|45832002|162367006

A rarer trigger,|84638005|84638005|410658008|103356009|103356009|410658008
observed
in some individuals,|125676002|385435006
is
the fullness|255342004
of the stomach immediately|69695003|49499008|181246003|49499008
after a large meal.|255509001

This
is
known|36692007
as snatiation
and
is
regarded
a medical disorder|74188005|64572001
passed
along genetically
as an autosomal dominant trait.|263681008

Sneezing|162367006
cannot
occur|272120004
during sleep|258158006
due to REM atonia -
a bodily state|398070004
wherein
motor neurons|31513005
are
not
stimulated
and
reflex signals|87572000|106146005
are
not
relayed
to the brain.|12738006|258335003

Sufficient external stimulants,|51117008|261074009|373333006
however,
may
cause|23981006|134198009
a person to|125676002
wake|255377004|307156004
from their sleep|258158006
for the purpose|363675004
of sneezing,|162367006
although
any sneezing occurring afterwards|162367006|272120004
would
take|419652001
place|257557008|421066005
with a partially awake status|248218005|263490005
at minimum.[2]|255605001|255604002

The sneeze reflex|162367006|87572000|162367006|106146005
involves|248448006
contraction|78558002
of a number|410680006|410681005
of different muscles|263735002|91727004
and
muscle groups|91727004|261586004|91727004|160481000
throughout the body,|279495008|123037004
typically
including|55919000
the eyelids.|80243003

The common suggestion|72906007
that
it
is
impossible to
sneeze|162367006
with one's eyes|421379005|81745001
open|56116003
is
,
however,
inaccurate.[3]|263782009

While
generally harmless
in healthy individuals,|263775005|125676002|263775005|385435006
sneezes spread disease|162367006|410677005|64572001
through the infectious aerosol droplets,|64242006|52262001
commonly
ranging
from 0.5|260316000
to 5 ?m.|264706000|264605009

40,000 droplets|259031006
can
be
produced
by a sneeze.|162367006

To
reduce|260400001
the possibility
of thus
spreading|410677005
disease|64572001
(
such as the flu,|6142004
one|421379005
should
hold|421139008
the forearm|14975008
or
the
inside of the elbow|127949000|16953009|76248009
in front|255549009
of one's mouth|421379005|74262004|421379005|123851003|421379005|21082005|421379005|181220002
and
nose|260540009|181195007
when
sneezing.|162367006

Using|260676000
one's hand|421379005|85562004|421379005|302539009
for
that purpose|363675004
is
inappropriate,
since
it
promotes
spreading|410677005
germs
through commonly touched objects|386476006|260787004|52962008|260787004|397624008|260787004
(most notably doorknobs|4757001
).

Examples
of preventive techniques|262073000|272394005|129428001|272394005
are
:
the deep exhalation|131197000|58322009
of the air|417696007
in the lungs|39607008
that
would
otherwise
be
used|394850002
in the
act
of sneezing,|162367006
holding|421139008
the breath|11891009
in
while
counting|258734002
to ten|23067006|420258001
or
gently|418449005
pinching|242905004
the bridge|277035007
of the nose|260540009|181195007
for several seconds.|261028005|257997001

Proven methods to|277025001|260686004|277025001|272394005
reduce|260400001
sneezing generally|162367006
advocate
reducing|260400001
interaction
with irritants,|412453003
such as keeping pets|224152001
out of the house to|261770009|257630004
avoid
animal dander|264287008
;
ensuring
the timely
and
continuous removal|255238004|118292001|255238004|128303001
of dirt|416705000
and
dust particles|33008008
through proper housekeeping
;
replacing filters|370124000|116250002
for furnaces
and
air-handling units|417696007|258666001
;
air filtration devices|417696007|360166003|303607000|417696007|360166003|49062001
and
humidifiers|71545009
;
and
staying away
from industrial
and
agricultural zones.

Some people,|125676002
however,
find
sneezes to|162367006
be
pleasurable
and
would
not
want|410526009
to
prevent
them.[5]|264706000|264605009

In Ancient Greece,|223651004
sneezes|162367006
were
believed
to
be
prophetic signs|72670004
from the gods.

In 401 BC,
for instance,
the Athenian general Xenophon|60132005
gave|419582001
a speech exhorting
his fellow soldiers
to fight|248005005
against the Persians.

A soldier
underscored
his conclusion
with a sneeze.|162367006

Thinking|88952004
that
this sneeze|162367006
was
a favorable sign|72670004
from the gods,
the soldiers
were
impressed.

Another divine moment
of sneezing|162367006
for the Greeks|1451003
occurs|272120004
in the story
of Odysseus.

His waiting wife Penelope,|127850001
hearing|47078008|118230007
Odysseus
may
be
alive,|438949009
says|66049007
that
he
and
his son|65616008
would
take|419652001
revenge
on the suitors
if
he
were
to
return.|7528007

At
that moment,
their son sneezes loudly|65616008|162367006
and
Penelope laughs|51078006
with joy,|112080002
reassured|223476006
that
it
is
a sign|72670004
from the gods
(Odyssey 17
:
541-550
).

It
may
be
because
this belief
survived
through the centuries,
that
in certain parts|17162000|260726005
of Greece today,|223651004
when
someone
is
asserting
something
and
the listener sneezes promptly|162367006
at the end|261782000|422117008
of the assertion,|397747003
the former|9130008
responds
"bless
you
and
I|42146005|22971001
am
speaking|87335007
the truth",
or
"bless
you
and
here
is
the truth"
(
in Greek "???? ??? ?? ??????? ???"-ya sou ki alithia leo,|1451003|388751000
or
"???? ??? ??? ?? ?? ? ???????"-ya sou ke na ki i alithia|223534000|385432009
).

In Europe,|223502009
principally
around the early Middle Ages,|264499004|28288005
it
was
believed
that one's life|421379005|224130005
was
in fact
tied|228197000
to one's breath -|421379005|11891009
a belief
reflected|225436004
in the word "expire"|255373000|58322009
(originally meaning "to
exhale|58322009
"
)
gaining|35105006|255396000|260366006|260369004|398092000
the additional meaning|260364009
of "to
come
to an end"|261782000|422117008
or
"to
die|419620001|399069006|419099009
".

This connection,|263538003
coupled
with the significant amount|386134007|107651007
of breath|11891009
expelled
from the body|279495008|123037004
during a sneeze,|162367006
had
likely_[citation|2931005
needed|410525008|103325001
_] led people to|88488004|125676002|236874000|125676002
believe
that sneezing|162367006
could
easily|36203004
be
fatal.|399166001

This theory,
if
proven|277025001
conclusively,
could
in turn|282987006
explain
the reasoning
behind the traditional "God bless|263901007
you" response
to a sneeze,|162367006
the origins|255395001
of which
are
currently unclear.|15240007

(
see|281004000
"Traditional Responses|263901007
To A Sneeze"|162367006
below
for alternative explanations
).

Sir Raymond Henry Payne Crawfurd,|304612009
for instance,
the late registrar|260383002|224531000
of the Royal College of Physicians,|224864007|309343006
in his 1909 book "|278212002
The Last Days|258703001
of Charles II",
states|398070004
that,
when
the controversial monarch
was
on his deathbed,
his medical attendants|74188005
administered|418283001
a concoction
of cowslips|71828009
and
extract|62972009
of ammonia to|421024009
promote
sneezing.|162367006

However,
it
is
not
known|36692007
if
this promotion
of sneezing|162367006
was
done
to
hasten
his death|419620001|268923008
(
as coup de grace,|224046004|223637004
or
as an ultimate attempt
at treatment.|276239002|416118004

In certain parts|17162000|260726005
of Eastern Asia,|223580003
particularly
in Chinese culture,|297876005|252398009|297876005|61594008|33897005|252398009|33897005|61594008
Japanese culture|414551003|252398009|414551003|61594008
and
Vietnamese culture,|312859007|252398009|312859007|61594008
a sneeze|162367006
without an obvious cause|134198009
was
generally
perceived|81742003
as a sign|72670004
that
someone
was
talking|87335007
about the sneezer
at
that very moment.|260358002

This
can
be
seen
in the Book|278212002
of Songs
(
a collection
of Chinese poems|297876005|33897005
)
[7]
in ancient China|223581004
as
early|264499004
as 1000 BC,
and
this belief
is
still
depicted
in present-day manga|52101004|258703001|52101004|259032004|246105001|258703001|246105001|259032004
and
anime.

In China,|223581004
Vietnam|223595001
and
Japan,|223583001
for instance,
there
is
a superstition
that
if
talking|87335007
behind someone's back causes the person being talked about to sneeze; as such, the sneezer can tell if something good is being said (one sneeze), something bad is being said (two sneezes in a row), even if someone
someone's
back
causes|134198009
the person|125676002
being
talked about to|87335007|286376008
sneeze|162367006
;
as
such,
the sneezer
can
tell
if
something good|20572008
is
being
said|66049007
(one sneeze|421379005|162367006
)
,
something bad|556001
is
being
said|66049007
(two sneezes|420797005|162367006
in a row
)
,
even
if
someone's
is
in love|23682002
with them
(three sneezes|421291004|162367006
in a row
)
or
if
this
is
a sign|72670004
that
they
are
about to
catch|30623001
a cold|285686007|82272006|84162001
(multiple sneezes|260396001|162367006
).

Parallel beliefs
are
known|36692007
to
exist
around the world,
particularly
in contemporary Greek,|1451003
Slavic,
Celtic,
English,|297487008|25804004
French,|19434008
and
Indian cultures.|252398009|61594008

Similarly,
in Nepal,|223602002
sneezers
are
believed
to
be
remembered
by someone
at that particular moment.

In Indian culture,|252398009|61594008
especially
in northern parts|260726005
of India,|223600005
and
also
in Iran,|223607008
it
has
been
a common superstition|72906007
that
a sneeze taking place|162367006|419652001|257557008|162367006|419652001|421066005
before the start|255395001
of any work|261041009
was
a sign|72670004
of impending bad interruption.|71033007|556001|76555007

It
was
thus customary to
pause
in order to
drink|226465004
water|11713004|119318008
or
break
any work rhythm|261041009|272121000
before resuming
the job|14679004
at hand|85562004|302539009
in order to
prevent
any misfortune
from occurring.|272120004

Contrarily,
in Polish culture,|286107005|252398009|286107005|61594008
especially
in their borderlands,
the Kresy,
a popular belief
persists
that sneezes|162367006
may
be
an inauspicious
sign|72670004
that one's mother-|421379005|72705000
in-law
speaks|286370002
ill|367391008
of their son-|65616008
in-law
at
that moment.

The same phenomenon|262126009
is
thought to|88952004
correspond
to daughters-|66089001
in-law
and
their mothers-|72705000
in-law.

As
with other Catholic countries,|74964007|223369002
such as Mexico,|223687006
Italy,|223668000
or
Ireland,|223676003
the remnants
of pagan culture|252398009|61594008
are
fostered|160497005
in Polish peasant idiosyncratic superstitions.|286107005|56840009

The practice
among Islamic culture,|271390004|252398009|271390004|61594008
in turn,|282987006
has
largely
been
based|418836005
on various Prophetic traditions|256220008|263901007
and
the teachings|409073007
of Muhammad.

An example
of this
is
Al-Bukhaari's narrations
from Abu Hurayrah
that
the Islamic prophet|271390004
once
said|66049007
:

_
When
one|421379005
of you sneezes,|162367006
let
him
say|66049007
,
"Al-hamdu-Lillah"_
(Praise|225221000
be
to God_,
and
let
his brother|70924004
or
companion say|62071000|262043009
to him,
"Yarhamuk Allah"_
(May God
have
mercy
on you
)
_.

If
he says,|66049007
"Yarhamuk-Allah",
then let [
the sneezer] say,
"Yahdeekum Allah wa yuslihu baalakum"_|421908005
(May God
guide|106384005|303479009
you
and
rectify
your condition|260905004
)
_._

In English-speaking countries,|297487008|87335007|223369002|25804004|87335007|223369002
the common verbal response|72906007|255373000
to another person's sneeze|125676002|162367006
is
"
(God
)
bless
you"
or
,
sometimes
in the United States,|223688001
the much less common "Gesundheit"|242762006|72906007|4757001|72906007
(
the German word|7695005|255373000
for "health"|263775005
)
or
"Salud"
(
the Spanish word|255373000
for "health"|263775005
).

There
are
several proposed origins|261028005|255395001
for the use "bless|277889008|419385000
you"
in the context|263491009
of sneezing|162367006
:

Indian culture|252398009|61594008
is
to
respond
with Krishna,
similar
to a blessing
in western cultures.|252398009|61594008

Common English onomatopoeias|72906007|297487008|72906007|25804004
for the sneeze sound|162367006|162367006|68325009
are
_ahchoo_,
_hachoo_,
_achoo_,
_atchoo_,
_achew_,
_atishoo_
and
_ahem_,
with the first syllable|255216001|232714002
corresponding
to the initial inhaling|884001|14910006|232714002|14910006
of air,|417696007
and
the last
to the sound|68325009
of the sneeze.|162367006
