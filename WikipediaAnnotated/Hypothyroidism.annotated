*Hypothyroidism|40930008
*
* /?ha?p???a??r??d?z?m/
is
a state|398070004
in which
the thyroid gland|69748006|181117000
does
not
make
enough thyroid hormone.|18220004

Iodine deficiency|237562002
is
often|70232002
cited
as the most common cause|4757001|72906007|134198009
of hypothyroidism|40930008
worldwide
but
it
can
be
caused|23981006|134198009
by many other factors.|74964007

It
can
result|394617004
from the lack|41277001
of a thyroid gland|69748006|181117000
or
from iodine-131 treatment,|404836005|276239002|404836005|416118004
and
can
also
be
associated|47429007
with increased stress.|23085004

Severe hypothyroidism|83986005
in infants|418119000
can
result|394617004
in cretinism.|190268003|75065003

A 2011 study|110465008|224699009
concluded
that
about 8%
of women|224526002
over 50
and
men|339947000
over 65|264695004
in the UK
suffer
from an under-active thyroid|261089000|55561003|69748006|261089000|55561003|61020000
and
that
as
many
as 100,000
of these people|125676002
could
benefit
from treatment|276239002|416118004
they
are
currently|15240007
not
receiving.[1]

Hypothyroidism|40930008
is
often|70232002
classified|73504009
by association|263534001|272151006
with the indicated organ dysfunction|410535002|410653004|386585008
(

:
[2][3]|260306008

Early hypothyroidism|264499004|40930008
is
often asymptomatic|70232002|84387000
and
can
have
very mild symptoms.|260358002|162468002

_Subclinical hypothyroidism_|54823002
is
a state|398070004
of normal thyroid hormone levels,|17621005|18220004|258395000|17621005|69748006|365774006|17621005|61020000|365774006|258744000|18220004|258395000|258744000|69748006|365774006|258744000|61020000|365774006
thyroxine|73187006|313408009
(T4
)
and
triiodothyronine|61275002|250668004
(T3
)
,
with mild elevation|255604002|103720008|255604002|255456001
of thyrotropin,|326013007
thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH).|326013007

With higher TSH levels|75540009|61167004|371879000|61167004
and
low free T4 levels,|62482003|5113004|258395000|371880002|5113004|258395000
symptoms
become
more readily apparent|242762006
in _clinical_|58147004
(
or
overt
)
_hypothyroidism_.|40930008

Hypothyroidism|40930008
can
be
associated|47429007
with the following symptoms|255260001
:
[7][8][9]

Subclinical hypothyroidism|54823002
occurs|272120004
when
thyrotropin|326013007
(TSH) levels|61167004
are
elevated|75540009
but
thyroxine|73187006|313408009
(T4
)
and
triiodothyronine|61275002|250668004
(T3
)
levels|258395000
are
normal.|17621005|258744000

In primary hypothyroidism,|111566002
TSH levels|61167004
are
high|75540009|371879000
and
T4
and
T3 levels|263288007
are
low.|62482003|371880002

TSH usually
increases|260366006
when
T4
and
T3 levels|263288007
drop.|404218003

TSH
prompts
the thyroid gland to|69748006|181117000
make
more hormone.|242762006|87568004

In subclinical hypothyroidism,|54823002
TSH
is
elevated|75540009
but
below the limit|255469002
representing
overt hypothyroidism.|40930008

The levels|258395000
of the active hormones|55561003|87568004
will
be
within the laboratory reference ranges.|261904005

During pregnancy there|289908002
is
a substantially increased need|35105006|410525008|35105006|103325001|260366006|410525008|260366006|103325001
of thyroid hormones|18220004
and
substantial
risk|30207005
that
a previously
unnoticed
,
subclinical|74314007
or
latent hypothyroidism|44104002|40930008
will
turn|282987006
into overt hypothyroidism.|40930008

Subclinical hypothyroidism|54823002
in early pregnancy,|264499004|289908002
compared
with normal thyroid function,|17621005|69748006|246464006|17621005|61020000|246464006|258744000|69748006|246464006|258744000|61020000|246464006
has
been
estimated|414135002
to
increase|260366006
the risk|30207005
of pre-eclampsia|15394000
with an odds ratio (OR)|118586006
of 1.7|260305007
and
the risk|30207005
of perinatal mortality|10588007
with an OR|118586006
of 2.7.[22]|260306008

Even mild|255604002
or
subclinical hypothyroidism|54823002
is
known to adversely|36692007
affect|4065008
fertility.|397594008|8619003|87727006

0.3%
of the general American population|60132005|385436007|60132005|389109008
have
overt hypothyroidism,|40930008
and
4.3%|260308009
have
subclinical hypothyroidism.|54823002

A 1995 survey
in the UK
found|404684003
the mean incidence|255586005
(
with 95% confidence intervals|225487001|385673002
)
of spontaneous hypothyroidism|5054005|40930008
in women|224526002
was
3.5/1000 survivors/year|260280001|258707000|260280001|259039008
(2.8-4.5|264655001
)
rising
to 4.1/1000 survivors/year|260308009|258707000|260308009|259039008
(3.3-5.0|260280001
)
for all
causes|134198009
of hypothyroidism|40930008
and
in men|339947000
was
0.6/1000 survivors/year|258707000|259039008
(0.3-1.2
).[24]

Estimates|414135002
of subclinical hypothyroidism range|54823002
between 3?8%,|260313008
increasing|260369004
with age|424144002
;
incidence
is
more common|242762006|72906007
in women|224526002
than
in men.[25]|339947000

Iodine deficiency|237562002
is
the most common cause|4757001|72906007|134198009
of hypothyroidism worldwide.|40930008

In iodine-replete individuals hypothyroidism|190279008|125676002|190279008|385435006
is
frequently|70232002
caused|23981006|134198009
by Hashimoto's thyroiditis,|21983002|66944004
or
otherwise
as a result|394617004
of
either
an absent thyroid gland|2667000|69748006|2667000|181117000
or
a deficiency|260372006|248325000
in stimulating hormones|87568004
from the hypothalamus|67923007|264483005
or
pituitary.|56329008|58805000

Factors
such as iodine deficiency|237562002
or
exposure|71677004|24932003
to iodine-131|404836005
from nuclear fallout,|84640000
which
is
absorbed
by the thyroid gland|69748006|181117000
like regular iodide|17854005|42146005
and
destroys
its cells,|4421005
can
increase|260366006
the risk.|30207005

Congenital hypothyroidism|190268003|75065003
is
very rare accounting|260358002|84638005|260358002|103356009
for approximately 0.2%|26175008
and
can
have
several causes|261028005|134198009
such as thyroid aplasia|69748006|45486003|61020000|45486003
or
defects|6920004
in the hormone metabolism.|87568004|47722004

Thyroid hormone insensitivity|18220004
(most often T3 receptor defect|4757001|70232002|116647005|6920004
)
also
falls|1912002
into this category
although
in this condition|260905004
the levels|258395000
of thyroid hormones|18220004
may
be
normal|17621005|258744000
or
even markedly|46998006
elevated.|75540009

Hypothyroidism|40930008
can
result|394617004
from postpartum thyroiditis,|52772002
a condition|260905004
that
affects|4065008
about 5%|264706000|264605009
of all women|224526002
within a year|258707000|259039008

The first phase|255216001|21191007|232714002|21191007
is
typically hyperthyroidism|34486009
;
the thyroid then|69748006|61020000
either
returns|7528007
to normal,|17621005|258744000
or
a woman|224526002
develops
hypothyroidism.|40930008

Of those women|224526002
who
experience
hypothyroidism|40930008
associated|47429007
with postpartum thyroiditis,|52772002
one|421379005

will
develop
permanent hypothyroidism|6934004|40930008
requiring
lifelong treatment.|276239002|416118004

Hypothyroidism|40930008
can
result|394617004
from
de Quervain's thyroiditis,|82119001
which,
in turn,|282987006
is
often|70232002
caused|23981006|134198009
by
having
a bad flu|556001|6142004
that enters|417985001
and
destroys part,|260726005
or
all,
the thyroid.[27]|69748006|61020000

Hypothyroidism|40930008
can
also
result|394617004
from sporadic inheritance,|75741005|246071007
sometimes autosomal recessive._[citation|258211005

Temporary hypothyroidism|14803004|40930008
can
be
due to the Wolff-Chaikoff effect.|253861007

A very high intake|260360000
of iodine|42146005|44588005
can
be
used|394850002
to temporarily
treat|395077000
hyperthyroidism,|34486009
especially
in an emergency situation.|25876001

Although
iodide|42146005
is
a substrate
for thyroid hormones,|18220004
high levels|75540009|258395000|371879000|258395000
reduce|260400001
iodide organification|42146005
in the thyroid gland,|69748006|181117000
decreasing|260371004
hormone production.|35188005

The antiarrhythmic agent amiodarone|67507000|372821002
can
cause|23981006|134198009
hyper-|44548000
or
hypothyroidism|40930008
due to its high iodine content.|75540009|42146005|276824008|75540009|44588005|276824008|371879000|42146005|276824008|371879000|44588005|276824008

Hypothyroidism|40930008
can
be
caused|23981006|134198009
by lithium-based mood stabilizers,|85899009|85256008|85899009|418836005|85256008
usually
used|394850002
to
treat|395077000
bipolar disorder|13746004
(previously
known|36692007
as manic depression|13746004
).

In fact,
lithium|85899009
has
occasionally
been
used|394850002
to
treat|395077000
hyperthyroidism.|34486009

Other drugs|74964007|410942007

include|55919000
interferon alpha,|45754009

be
environmental stress|276339004|262188008
as well as
lesser-considered homeostatic stress|263796003|21979002|262188008

Stress|262188008
may
cause|23981006|134198009
hypothyroidism|40930008
or
reduced thyroid functioning|260400001|69748006|246464006|260400001|61020000|246464006

the HPA axis|28585007|39976000|28585007|388282002
which
down-regulates|247524003
thyroid function,|69748006|246464006|61020000|246464006
[30]
reducing|260400001
the conversion|272148004
of T4
to T3,
[31] weakening|264664006
the immune system thus|116003000
promoting
autoimmunity,|4301008
[32] causing thyroid hormone resistance,|23981006|23981006|23981006|111567006

and
resulting|42752001

The only|50607009|420295001
validated
test|269814003|272393004
to
diagnose|439401001
primary hypothyroidism,|111566002
is
to
measure|246445000|272391002
thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH)|326013007
and
free thyroxine|5113004|86211008
(T4

However,
these levels|258395000
can
be
affected|247591002|248448006
by non-thyroidal illnesses.|69748006|39104002|61020000|39104002

High levels|75540009|258395000|371879000|258395000
of TSH
indicate|410535002
that
the thyroid|69748006|61020000
is
not
producing
sufficient levels|51117008|258395000
of thyroid hormone|18220004
(mainly
as
thyroxine|73187006|313408009

However,
measuring|258104002|263571004
just TSH
fails
to
diagnose|439401001
secondary|2603003|81170007

following|255260001
suggested blood|87612001|119273009
testing|272393004
if
the TSH
is
normal|17621005|258744000
and
hypothyroidism|40930008
is
still
suspected|415684004
:

Additionally,
the following measurements|255260001|272391002
may
be
needed|410525008|103325001
:

Hypothyroidism|40930008
is
treated|28995006
with the levorotatory forms|246176004
of thyroxine|73187006|313408009
(levothyroxine|73187006
(L-T4|258995007|420559008
)
and
triiodothyronine|61275002|250668004
(liothyronine|61275002
)
(L-T3|258995007|420559008
).

Synthroid|126202002
is
,
in the
US,
the most common name form|4757001|72906007|246176004
of the pill Levothyroxine.|46992007|73187006

Synthroid|126202002
is
also
the most common pill|4757001|72906007|46992007
prescribed
by doctors|309343006
that
has
the synthetic thyroid hormone|87568004|69748006|87568004|61020000|18220004
in it.

This medicine|410942007
can
improve|385425000|3442003|385633008
symptoms
of thyroid deficiency|69748006|260372006|69748006|248325000|61020000|260372006|61020000|248325000
such as slow speech,|419443000
lack|41277001
of energy,|248272003
weight gain,|262286000
hair loss,|278040002
dry skin,|16386004
and
feeling cold.|84162001

It also
helps
to
treat|395077000
goiter.|3716002

It
is
also
used|394850002
to
treat|395077000
some kinds|261664005
of thyroid cancer|363478007
along
with surgery|83578000
and
other medicines.|74964007|410942007

Both
synthetic
and
animal-derived thyroid tablets|387961004|69748006|385055001|387961004|69748006|428673006|387961004|61020000|385055001|387961004|61020000|428673006
are
available|103328004
and
can
be
prescribed
for patients|116154003
in need|410525008|103325001
of additional thyroid hormone.|260364009|18220004

Thyroid hormone|18220004
is
taken daily,|419652001|69620002
and
doctors|309343006
can
monitor|13288007
blood levels to|87612001|258395000|119273009|258395000
help
assure proper dosing.

Levothyroxine|73187006
is
best|20572008|3442003
taken 30?60 minutes|419652001|259030007
before breakfast,
as
some food|255620007
can
diminish|1250004
absorption.

Calcium|5540006
can
inhibit|61511001
the absorption
of levothryoxine.

Compared
to water,|11713004|119318008
coffee|29263009
reduces|260400001
absorption
of levothyroxine|73187006
by about 30 percent.|118582008

Some patients|116154003
might
appear
to
be
resistant to|30714006
levothyroxine|73187006
,
when
in fact
they
do
not properly
absorb
the tablets -|385055001|428673006
a problem|55607006
which
is
solved
by pulverizing
the medication.|410942007

There
are
several different treatment protocols|261028005|263735002|276239002|258049002|261028005|263735002|416118004|258049002
in thyroid-replacement therapy|69748006|182819002|61020000|182819002
:

The potential benefit|30207005
from substituting
some T3
for T4
has
been
investigated|116698004
,
but
no conclusive benefit
for combination therapy|229554006
has
been
shown.[48][49]

The 2002 Laboratory Medicine Practice Guidelines|261904005|410942007
of the National Academy
of Clinical Biochemistry|58147004
state|398070004
that
during pregnancy|289908002
:
"
The L-T4 dose|258995007|277406006|258995007|408102007|420559008|277406006|420559008|408102007
should
be
increased|35105006|260366006
(usually
by 50 mcg/day|258685003|258703001|258685003|259032004
)
to
maintain|385630006
a serum TSH|67922002
between 0.5|260316000
and
2.0 mIU/L and a serum FT4|260306008|258999001|67922002
in the upper third|264253003
of the normal reference interval."|17621005|385673002|258744000|385673002
Doctors however often|309343006|70232002
assume
that
if
your TSH
is
in the "normal range",|260395002
sometimes
defined
as high|75540009|371879000
as 5.5 mIu/L,|264689000|258999001
it
has
no effect|253861007
on fertility.|397594008|8619003|87727006

Healthy pregnant women however|263775005|255409004
have
a TSH level|61167004
of
around 1.0 mIU/L.|260305007|258999001

There
is
a range
of opinion
on the biochemical|80534008
and
symptomatic point|264931009
at which to
treat|395077000
with levothyroxine,|73187006
the typical treatment|276239002|416118004
for overt hypothyroidism.|40930008

Reference ranges
have
been
debated
as well.|20572008

As of 2003,
the American Association|263534001|272151006
of Clinical Endocrinologists|58147004|61894003
(ACEE
)
considers
0.3?3.0 mIU/L|258999001
within normal range.[50]|260395002

There
is
always
the risk|30207005
of overtreatment
and
hyperthyroidism.|34486009

Some studies|110465008|224699009
have
suggested
that subclinical hypothyroidism|54823002
does
not
need|410525008|103325001
to
be
treated.|28995006

A 2007 meta-analysis|272389005
by the Cochrane Collaboration
found|404684003
no benefit
of thyroid-hormone replacement|18220004|3137001|18220004|282089006|69748006|266717002|61020000|266717002
except "
some parameters|252116004
of lipid profiles|70106000
and
left-ventricular function."[51]|250907009
A 2002 meta-analysis looking|272389005|386548000
into
whether subclinical hypothyroidism|54823002
may
increase|260366006
the risk|30207005
of cardiovascular disease,|49601007
as
has
been
previously
suggested
,
[52]
found|404684003
a possible modest increase|371930009|260366006|60022001|260366006
and
suggested
further studies|46053002|110465008|46053002|224699009
be
undertaken
with coronary-heart disease|53741008
as an end point "|261782000|422117008
before
current recommendations|15240007
are
updated."[53]

Compounded slow-release T3|62105006|419443000|58000006|62105006|419443000|68776005|62105006|419443000|258760001|62105006|419443000|129299003|62105006|419443000|115956009
has
been
suggested
for use|277889008|419385000
in combination|89780004
with T4,
which proponents
argue
will
mitigate|6736007
many
of the symptoms
of functional hypothyroidism|40143009|40930008|246464006|40930008
and
improve|385425000|3442003|385633008
quality|263496004
of life.|224130005

This
is
still controversial
and
is
rejected
by the conventional medical establishment.[54]|255333006|74188005

Hypothyroidism|40930008
is
also
a relatively common disease|72906007|64572001
in domestic dogs,|448771007
with some specific breeds|69658003
having
a definite predisposition.[55]|255545003|76522002|264691008
