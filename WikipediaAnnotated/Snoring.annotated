is
the vibration|271421005|33679000
of respiratory structures|258162000|449071006
and
the resulting sound,|42752001|42752001|68325009
due to obstructed air movement|263821009|417696007|255324009
during breathing|14910006|258162000
while
sleeping.|258158006|248220008

In some cases|398241000|413769002
the sound|68325009
may
be
soft,|37378003
but
in other cases,|74964007|398241000|74964007|413769002
it
can
be
loud|24547000
and
unpleasant.

Snoring|162375000
during sleep|258158006
may
be
a sign,|72670004
or
first alarm,|255216001|39869006|232714002|39869006
of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA).|78275009

Generally
speaking|87335007
the structures
involved|248448006
are
the uvula|26140008
and
soft palate.|49460000|245784004

The irregular airflow|49608001|4601000
is
caused|23981006|134198009
by a passageway blockage|255592004
and
is
usually
due to one|421379005
of the following|255260001
:

Snoring|162375000
is
known to|36692007
cause|23981006|134198009
sleep deprivation|130989002
to snorers
and
those
around them,
as well as
daytime drowsiness,|28017001|271782001|28017001
irritability,|55929007
lack|41277001
of focus|87017008|363702006
and
decreased libido.|8357008

It
has
also
been
suggested
that
it
can
cause|23981006|134198009
significant psychological|386134007|60224009
and
social damage|37782003
to sufferers.

Multiple studies|260396001|110465008|260396001|224699009
reveal|263857004
a positive correlation|258758003|10828004
between loud snoring|24547000|162375000
and
risk|30207005
of heart attack|22298006
(about +34% chance
)
and
stroke|230690007
(about +67% chance
).[3]|260313008

Though
snoring|162375000
is
often|70232002
considered
a minor affliction,|410599005|255606000
snorers
can
sometimes
suffer
severe impairment|24484000|40226000
of lifestyle.|60134006

The between-|11896004
subjects
trial|110465008
by Armstrong
et
al.

discovered
a statistically significant improvement|386134007
in marital relations|160787000|125677006
after snoring|162375000
was
surgically|83578000
corrected.|370975003

This
was
confirmed|59156000
by evidence|18669006
from Gall

New studies|7147002|110465008|7147002|224699009
associate|47429007
loud "snoring"|24547000|162375000
with the development|278923009
of carotid artery atherosclerosis,|300920004|51114001|300920004|11527006|69105007|38716007|32062004|38716007
[7]
the risk|30207005
of brain damage[8]|2470005
and
of stroke.|230690007

Researchers
hypothesize
that loud snoring|24547000|162375000
creates
turbulence
in carotid artery blood flow closest|69105007|58190003|29179001|32062004|58190003|29179001
to the airway.|43725001|89187006

Generally speaking,|87335007
increased turbulence|35105006|260366006
irritates
blood cells|63370004
and
has
previously
been
implicated
as a cause|134198009
of atherosclerosis.|38716007

A U.S.|223688001

study|110465008|224699009
estimates|414135002
that roughly
one|421379005
in every 15 Americans
is
affected|247591002|248448006
by
at least
a moderate degree|6736007|258395000|6736007|246173007
of sleep apnea._[citation|73430006

Statistics
on snoring|162375000
are
often contradictory,|70232002
but
at least 30%|276139006|263796003
of adults|133936004
and
perhaps
as many|260396001
as 50%
of people|125676002

One survey|421379005
of 5,713 Italian residents|264706000|297502002|405277009|264706000|31637002|405277009|264605009|297502002|405277009|264605009|31637002|405277009

and
13.8%
of women,|224526002

aged|424144002|105436006
60
to 65 years|264695004|258707000

this
suggests
an increased susceptibility|35105006|76522002|35105006|118588007|260366006|76522002|260366006|118588007
to snoring|162375000
as age increases.[10]|424144002|260366006

Almost all treatments|276239002
for snoring revolve|162375000
around clearing
the blockage
in the breathing passage.|89187006

This
is
the reason snorers|410666004
are
advised|424900004
to
lose
weight|27113001|272102008|39857003
(to
stop|422117008
fat|271590003
from pressing
on the throat|54066008|49928004|264231000
)
,
stop smoking|422117008|365981007
(smoking weakens|365981007
and
clogs
the throat|54066008|49928004|264231000
)
and
sleep|258158006

Specially
made
dental appliances|272244007
called
mandibular advancement splints,|91609006|129352007|16650009|91609006|129352007|48300006

a common mode|72906007
of treatment|276239002|416118004
for snoring.|162375000

Typically,
a dentist specializing|106289002|67995009|82603007|67995009
in sleep apnea dentistry|73430006
is
consulted.|11429006

Such appliances|334251007
have
been
proven|277025001
to
be
effective|255403003|254648000

One disadvantage|421379005
of the cheaper devices|303607000|49062001
compared
to the professionally fitted devices|91175000|303607000|91175000|49062001
is
the difficulty|371157007
in setting
up the correct jaw position.|661005|246449006|181811001|246449006

An over-advanced jaw|21481007|86005002|661005|21481007|86005002|181811001
results|394617004

whilst
an
under-advanced jaw|86005002|661005|86005002|181811001
produces
no therapeutic effect.|262202000|253861007

The professionally fitted devices generally|91175000|303607000|91175000|49062001
incorporate
an adjustment mechanism|410616005|257544000|410617001|257544000
so
that jaw advancement|661005|129352007|181811001|129352007
can
be
easily|36203004
increased|35105006|260366006
or
decreased|1250004|260400001|260371004
after fitting.|122467006

To
adjust|410617001
most "do it yourself" appliances|334251007
it
is
necessary to
reheat
them
and
mold|84489001
them again
in the desired new position.|7147002|246449006

Alternatively,
given|419582001
the low cost,|62482003|371880002
a new splint|7147002|16650009
can
be
used._[citation|394850002

Previously
in the United States,|223688001
mandibular advancement splints|91609006|129352007|16650009|91609006|129352007|48300006
were
considered
to
be
class 2 medical devices|258393007|303607000
and
could
not
be
legally
sold
without a prescription.|260885003

Americans
were
,
however,
allowed
to
purchase
these devices|303607000|49062001
outside the United States|223688001
and
import
them
for personal use.|277889008|419385000

In Australia,|223621005
manufacturers
can
obtain|398092000
approval|9571008

A continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) machine|229309006|61284002
is
often|70232002
used to|394850002
control|31509003
sleep apnea|73430006
and
the snoring|162375000
associated|47429007
with it.

To
keep
the airway|43725001|89187006
open,|56116003
a device|303607000|49062001
pumps|44668000
a controlled stream|31509003|257709004
of air|417696007
through a flexible hose|261012000
to a mask worn|261382003
over the nose,|260540009|181195007
mouth,|74262004|123851003|21082005|181220002
or
both.[15]

Surgery|83578000
is
also available|103328004
as a method|260686004|272394005
of correcting social snoring.|370975003|162375000

Some procedures,|71388002
such as uvulopalatopharyngoplasty,|8335001
attempt
to
widen|90522003
the airway|43725001|89187006
by removing tissues|127485006|85756007
in the back of the throat,|255551008|54066008|255551008|49928004|255551008|264231000
including|55919000
the uvula|26140008
and
pharynx.|54066008|181211006

These surgeries|83578000
are
quite invasive, however,|10179008
and
there
are
risks|30207005
of adverse side effects.|182353008

The most dangerous risk|4757001|30207005
is
that
enough scar tissue|70582006|275322007
could
form|246176004
within the throat|54066008|49928004|264231000
as a result|394617004
of the incisions to|34896006
make
the airway|43725001|89187006
more narrow|242762006|18043004|242762006|25659002|242762006|134223000
than it
was
prior to surgery,|83578000
diminishing|1250004
the airspace
in the velopharynx.

Scarring|275322007
is
an individual trait,|125676002|385435006
so
it
is
difficult|52925006
for a surgeon to|304292004
predict
how much|242762006|4757001
a person|125676002
might
be
predisposed
to scarring.|275322007

Currently,|15240007
the American Medical Association|74188005|263534001|74188005|272151006
does
not
approve|9571008
of the use|277889008|419385000
of lasers to|122456005
perform|398166005
operations|83578000
on the pharynx|54066008|181211006

uvula.|26140008

Radiofrequency ablation (RFA)|257729003|64597002
is
a relatively new surgical treatment|7147002|83578000
for snoring.|162375000

This treatment|276239002|416118004
applies|410618006|417924000
radiofrequency energy|248272003
and
heat|88999006
(
between 77?C
to 85?C
)
to the soft tissue|181607009
at the back of the throat,|255551008|54066008|255551008|49928004|255551008|264231000
such as the soft palate|49460000|245784004
and
uvula,|26140008
causing|23981006
scarring|275322007
of the tissue|85756007
beneath the skin.|119325001|39937001|181469002

After healing,|298005009|90910008
this results|394617004
in stiffening
of the treated area.|28995006|42798000

The procedure|71388002
takes|419652001
less
than one hour,|421379005|258702006|421379005|286551008
is
usually
performed|398166005
on an outpatient basis,|373864002|373864002|418836005

usually
requires
several treatment sessions.|261028005|276239002|261028005|416118004

Radiofrequency ablation|257729003|64597002
is
frequently effective|70232002|255403003|70232002|254648000
in reducing|260400001
the severity|272141005

which typically
lasts
no more|242762006
than 30 minutes,|259030007
the soft palate|49460000|245784004

snoring.|162375000

This procedure|71388002
addresses|397635003
one|421379005
of the most common causes|4757001|72906007|134198009
of snoring|162375000
and
sleep apnea ? vibration|73430006|271421005|73430006|33679000

An open label non-randomized study|56116003|110465008|56116003|224699009
in thirty patients|116154003
found|404684003
benefit
from pseudoephedrine,|372900003|105313001
domperidone,|387181004
and
the combination|89780004
in the treatment|276239002|416118004
of severe snoring.[18]|24484000|162375000

There
are
various natural methods|256220008|510009|260686004|256220008|510009|272394005
alleged
to
alleviate
snoring.|162375000

These
can
be
in the form|246176004
of herbal pills,|46992007
acupressure devices|231107005|303607000|231107005|49062001
or
specialized acupuncture.|67995009|44868003|44868003

There
are
occasions|84638005
wherein
snoring|162375000
is
the result|394617004
of a wrong sleeping position.|258158006|246449006|248220008|246449006

Sleeping|258158006|248220008
with too many pillows|13855007
can
stretch|122546009
and
narrow|18043004|25659002|134223000
the air passage.|417696007|255592004

Use|277889008|419385000
one|421379005
pillow|13855007
to
avoid
it.

Also,
lying|40199007|255576009
on the back|123961009|255551008|281213008|302552004|77568009
can
cause|23981006|134198009
snoring.|162375000

So,|223528007
a change|243326001|263703002
in sleeping position|258158006|246449006|248220008|246449006

be
a help.

one medical practitioner|421379005|158965000
noting
anecdotally
that professional singers seldom|14831008|103356009
snore|162375000
,
[20]
but
sufficient study|51117008|110465008|51117008|224699009
of this area|42798000
remains
to
be
undertaken.[21]

Snoring|162375000
can
cause|23981006|134198009
significant relationship issues,|386134007|272151006|55607006
as well as
health effects|263775005|253861007
of sleep deficit|258158006|260372006|258158006|248325000
