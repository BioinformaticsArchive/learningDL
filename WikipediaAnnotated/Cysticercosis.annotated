*Cysticercosis|105684008
*
* refers|439980006
to tissue infection|85756007
after exposure|71677004|24932003
to eggs|102263004
of _Taenia solium_,|17966003
the pork tapeworm.|17966003|240818004

The disease|64572001
is
spread|410677005
via the fecal-oral route|39477002|26643006
through contaminated food|228034007
and
water,|11713004|119318008
and
is
primarily
a food borne disease.|255620007|106970005|64572001|255620007|81827009|64572001|255620007|398209006|64572001

After ingestion|111984006
the eggs|102263004
pass
through the lumen|113342003|342806003|398252006
of the intestine|261093006
into the tissues|85756007
and
migrate
preferentially
to the brain|12738006|258335003
and
muscles.|91727004

There
they
form|246176004
cysts|441457006
that
can
persist
for years.|258707000

In some cases|398241000|413769002
the cysts|441457006
will
eventually
cause|23981006|134198009
an inflammatory reaction presenting|257552002|246105001
as painful nodules|22253000|27925004|22253000|279365004
in the muscles|91727004
and
seizures|91175000
when
the cysts|441457006
are
located
in the brain.|12738006|258335003

Symptomatic disease|264931009|64572001
from _Taenia solium_ cysts|17966003|441457006
in the brain|12738006|258335003
is
referred|439980006
to
as
*
*neurocysticercosis|230215006
*
*
and
is
the most common helminthic|4757001|72906007|37017009
(tapeworm|86133004|79501007
)
infection
of the brain worldwide.|12738006|258335003

Cysticercosis|105684008
should
be
differentiated|263933003
from taeniasis|76172008
:
carriage
of the adult tapeworm|133936004|86133004|133936004|79501007
in the intestine|261093006
(
which
is
through ingestion|111984006
of cysts|441457006
in an intermediate host,|11896004
not
the ingestion|111984006
of the eggs|102263004
as
in cysticercosis|105684008
).

These
represent
two different stages|420797005|263735002|261612004
of the parasite?s life cycle.|37763007|224130005|44180009

Though
both
forms|246176004
of infection
can
potentially
occur|272120004
in the same individual|262126009|125676002|262126009|385435006
at the same time,|262126009|410669006
they
are
distinct disease entities|64572001
and
have
different treatments|263735002|276239002
and
potential outcomes.[2]|30207005|394617004

The cause|134198009
of human cysticercosis|278412004|105684008
is
the larval form|246176004
of _Taenia solium_|17966003
(pork tapeworm|17966003|240818004
).

_T.

solium_
is
a member|394852005
of Phylum Platyhelminthes,|106685002
class Cestoda,|79501007
Order Cyclophyllidea|106723004
and
family Taeniidae.|106724005

The common larval stage|72906007|21191007|72906007|371508000|72906007|261612004
of _T.

solium_
was
also
known|36692007
as Cysticercus cellulosae.|17966003

The earliest reference|264499004
to tapeworms|79501007
were
found|404684003
in the works|261041009
of ancient Egyptians|1919006
that date|410671006
back to almost 2000 BC.

The description
of measled pork|226934003
in the _History|392521001
of Animals_|387961004
written|12261009
by Aristotle
(384?322 BC
)
showed
that
the infection
of pork|226934003
with tapeworm|86133004|79501007
was
known|36692007
to ancient Greeks|1451003
at
that time.|410669006

It
was
also
known|36692007
to Jewish[4]|276121002|160543007
and
later|260383002
to early Muslim physicians|264499004|271390004|309343006|264499004|309884000|309343006
and
has
been
proposed
as one|421379005
of the reasons|410666004
for pork|226934003
being
forbidden
by Jewish|276121002|160543007
and
Islamic dietary laws.|271390004|41829006

Recent examination|6493001|5880005
of evolutionary histories|392521001
of hosts
and
parasites|37763007
and
DNA evidence|24851008|18669006
show
that
over 10,000 years ago,|258707000
ancestors
of modern humans|278412004
in Africa|223498002
became
exposed|24932003
to
tapeworm|86133004|79501007
when
they
scavenged
for food|255620007
or
preyed
on antelopes|107010006
and
bovids,|389115008
and
later
passed
the infection
on
to domestic animals
such as pigs.[6]|106996007|78678003

An African cysticercosis research|413464008|105684008
was
allegedly
referred|439980006
to
by Du Huan
in the 8 c.

China._[citation|223581004

Cysticercosis|105684008
was
described
by Johannes Udalric Rumler
in 1555
;
however,
the connection|263538003
between tapeworms|79501007
and
cysticercosis|105684008
had
not
been
recognized
at
that time.|410669006

Around 1850,
Friedrich K?chenmeister fed pork containing cysticerci|238092004|226934003|42504009|78167007
of _T.

solium_
to humans|278412004
awaiting
execution|219290002
in a prison,|257656006
and
after
they
had
been
executed
,
he
recovered|74822006
the developing
and
adult tapeworms|133936004|79501007
in their intestines.|261093006

By the middle|255562008|399488007
of the 19th century,
it
was
established|263748003|385645004
that cysticercosis|105684008
was
caused|23981006|134198009
by the ingestion|111984006
of the eggs|102263004
of _T.

solium_.[8]

Humans|278412004
are
_T.

solium_ reservoirs.|257687008

They
are
infected
by eating undercooked pork|48263008|226934003
that
contains|42504009
viable cysticerci.|263927007|78167007

The cysticercus|78167007
develops
into an adult tape worm|133936004|27601005|133936004|37017009
in the gut|122865005
and
produces
large numbers|255509001|410680006|255509001|410681005
of eggs|102263004
which
pass
out
in the feces.|39477002

The presence|386397008
of an adult tape worm|133936004|27601005|133936004|37017009
in the gut|122865005
is
reasonably harmless.

The condition|260905004
known|36692007
as cysticercosis|105684008
in humans|278412004
occurs|272120004
due to the ingestion|111984006
of tape worm eggs,|103565001
either
from external sources|261074009|260753009
or
from the person's own feces.|125676002|39477002

The human|278412004
has
then
become
an accidental|53348004
and
"dead-end" intermediate host|419620001|261782000|11896004|419620001|422117008|11896004
(
that
is
,
the infection
can
not
progress|385651009
any further|46053002
).

Pigs,|106996007|78678003
which
are
the "normal" intermediate host|17621005|11896004|258744000|11896004
for this parasite,|37763007
get
infected
with cysticerci|78167007
when
they
ingest|111984006
human feces.|278412004|39477002

The incubation period|406646006
ranges
from months|258706009
to over ten years.[10]|21481007|23067006|258707000|21481007|420258001|258707000

_T.

solium_ worms|27601005|26089000
may
reach|282679008
a length|410668003
of several meters.|261028005|272185007

The scolex
has
four suckers,|421534005
and
a double crown|1305003|261516009|1305003|75628001
of prominent hooks,|4657009|260883005
which
attach|102491009
to the intestinal mucosa.|68534000

_T.

solium_ eggs|102263004
are
spherical|34258004
and
30
to 40 ?m|259031006
in diameter.[10]|81827009

The cysticercus larva|78167007
completes|255594003
development|278923009
in about 2 months.|258706009

It
is
semitransparent, opalescent white,|263824001|413773004|263824001|185984009|263824001|371251000
and
elongate
oval
in shape|107644003|246176004|300842002
and
may
reach|282679008
a length|410668003
of 0.6
to 1.8 cm.[9]|260305007

The life cycle|224130005|44180009
involves|248448006
humans|278412004
as a definite host|255545003
and
pigs|106996007|78678003
as an intermediate host.|11896004

Pigs|106996007|78678003
ingest|111984006
contaminated food|228034007
or
water|11713004|119318008
that
contains|42504009
eggs|102263004
or
proglottids
from human feces.|278412004|39477002

The eggs|102263004
(ova|263828003
develop
into cysticerci|78167007
in pig muscles.|78678003|91727004|388393002|91727004|388392007|91727004

Humans|278412004
become
infected
when
they
ingest|111984006
raw|6304003
or
undercooked pork|226934003
that
contain|42504009
viable cysticerci.|263927007|78167007

Upon reaching|282679008
the small intestine,|264196002|181250005
the scolex attaches|102491009
to the intestinal wall|360972004
and
a proglottid chain grows.|46666003

_T.

solium_
releases|115956009
three|421291004
to six proglottids/day,|422218008|258703001|422218008|259032004
bearing|106970005|81827009|398209006
30,000
to 70,000 eggs|102263004
per proglottid
into the intestine.|261093006

Nearly 250,000 ova|263828003
are
passed
daily|69620002
into the human feces|278412004|39477002
and
to the environment,|276339004
and
the cycle|44180009
continues.|255238004

Infections
with cysticercus|78167007
occur|272120004
after humans|278412004
consume
the ova|263828003
from exogenous sources|261074009|260753009|51352008|260753009
or
through self-infection
via the fecal-oral route.|39477002|26643006

Humans,|278412004
in this case,|398241000
are
intermediate hosts.|11896004

Ova|263828003
are
digested
in the stomach|69695003|181246003
and
release oncospheres|58000006|68776005|258760001|129299003|115956009
which
penetrate|53568006
the intestinal wall|360972004
and
reach|282679008
the bloodstream.

These oncospheres
develop
into cysticerci|78167007
in any organ|410653004
but
are
common|72906007
in brain,|12738006|258335003
subcutaneous tissue,|67769002|71966008
or
eyes.|81745001

Cysticerci|78167007
can
develop
in any voluntary muscle|127954009
in humans.|278412004

Invasion|370052007
of muscle|91727004
by cysticerci|78167007
can
cause|23981006|134198009
myositis,|26889001
with fever,|386661006
eosinophilia,|191357009|419455006|419769007
and
muscular pseudohypertrophy,|249830001
which
initiate
with muscle swelling|298280009
and
later
progress|385651009
to atrophy|13331008
and
fibrosis.|263756000

In most cases,|398241000|413769002
it
is
asymptomatic|84387000
since
the cysticerci|78167007
die|419620001|399069006|419099009
and
become
calcified.

The term neurocysticercosis|230215006
is
generally
accepted|385645004
to
refer|439980006
to cysts|441457006
in the parenchyma
of the brain.|12738006|258335003

It
presents|52101004|246105001
with seizures|91175000
and
,
less commonly,|276139006|263796003
headaches.[12]|25064002

located
within the ventricles|35764002|21814001
of the brain|12738006|258335003
can
block|26036001|112232007
the outflow
of cerebrospinal fluid|65216001
and
present|52101004|246105001
with symptoms
of increased intracranial pressure.[13]|271719001

Racemose neurocysticercosis refers|230215006|439980006
to cysts|441457006
in the subarachnoid space.|35951006

These
can
occasionally
grown
into large lobulated masses|255509001|300848003|255509001|118538004
causing|23981006
pressure|279046003|13543005|257893003
on surrounding structures.[14]|355648006

Neurocysticercosis|230215006

the spinal cord,|2748008|180959008
most commonly
presenting|246105001
as
back pain|22913005
and
radiculopathy.[15]

In some cases,|398241000|413769002
cysticerci|78167007
may
be
found|404684003
in the globe,|81745001|244486005
extraocular muscles,|67833000
and
subconjunctiva.

Depending
on the location,|246267002
they
may
cause|23981006|134198009
visual difficulties|397540003
that
fluctuate|255341006
with eye position,|81745001|246449006|244486005|246449006
retinal edema,|6141006
hemorrhage,|131148009
a decreased vision|397540003|225581002
or
even
a visual loss.[9][10]|397540003

Subcutaneous cysts|441457006|263887005|441457006
are
in the form|246176004
of firm,|20583004
mobile nodules,|27925004|279365004
occurring|272120004
mainly
on the trunk|22943007|262225004
and
extremities.|66019005|2592007

of the life cycle.|224130005|44180009

Only
a small minority|255507004|410599005|255507004|255606000
of patients|116154003
with cysticercosis|105684008
will
harbor|257621007
a tapeworm,|86133004|79501007

ineffective
for diagnosis.[17]|439401001

In the CDC?s immunoblot assay,
cysticercosis-specific antibodies|120655005|69658003|105684008|404263002
can
react
with structural glycoprotein antigens|115257005
from the larval cysts|441457006
of _T.

solium._[11] However,
this
is
mainly
a research tool|86967005

in clinical practice|58147004
and
nearly unobtainable
in resource limited settings.|255469002

The diagnosis|439401001
of neurocysticercosis|230215006
is
mainly clinical,|58147004

of imaging studies.|363679005|110465008|363679005|224699009|278395004|110465008|278395004|224699009

Neuroimaging
with CT
or
MRI|113091000
is
the most useful method|4757001|260686004|4757001|272394005
of diagnosis.|439401001

CT scan|77477000
shows
both
calcified
and
uncalcified cysts,|441457006
as well as
distinguishing active|55561003
and
inactive cysts.|73425007|441457006

MRI|113091000
is
more sensitive|242762006|83185005
in detection
of intraventricular cysts.[10]|441457006

Neurocysticercosis most often|230215006|70232002
presents|52101004|246105001
as headaches|25064002
and
acute onset seizures,|255363002|91175000
thus
the immediate mainstay|88694003|49499008
of therapy|276239002
is
anticonvulsant medications.|255632006|410942007

Once the seizures|91175000
have
been
brought|68369002
under control,|31509003
antihelminthic treatments|372802005|276239002
may
be
undertaken.

The decision to
treat|395077000
with antiparasitic therapy|333032003|276239002
is
complex|103360007
and
based|418836005
on the stage|21191007|371508000|261612004
and
number|410680006|410681005
of cysts|441457006
present|52101004|246105001
,
their location,|246267002
and
the patient's specific clinical presentation.|116154003|69658003|58147004|246105001

Antiparasitic treatment|333032003|276239002|333032003|416118004
should
be
given|419582001
in combination|89780004
with corticosteroids|79440004
and
anticonvulsants to|255632006
reduce|260400001
inflammation|257552002
surrounding|355648006
the cysts|441457006
and
lower|261122009
the risk|30207005
of seizures.|91175000

Albendazole|387558006
is
generally preferable
over praziquantel|387310003
due to its lower cost|261122009
and
fewer drug interactions.[19]|57176003|404204005

Asymptomatic cysts,|84387000|441457006
such as those discovered incidentally
on neuroimaging
done
for another reason,|410666004
may
never
lead|88488004
to symptomatic disease|264931009|64572001
and
in many cases|398241000|413769002
do
not
require
therapy.|276239002

Calcified cysts|87070002
have
already
died|419620001|419099009
and
involuted.

Further antiparasitic therapy|46053002|333032003|276239002
will
be
of no benefit.

Surgical intervention|83578000
is
much more likely to|242762006|2931005|4757001|2931005
be
needed|410525008|103325001
in cases|398241000|413769002
of intraventricular, racemose,
or
spinal neurocysticercosis.|230215006

Treatments|276239002
includes|55919000
direct excision|255589003|118292001|255589003|128303001
of ventricular cysts,|21814001|441457006
shunting|88834003
procedures,|71388002
and
removal|118292001|128303001
of cysts|441457006
via endoscopy.|423827005

In ophthalmic disease,|371405004
surgical removal|118292001|128303001|128304007
is
necessary
for cysts|441457006
within the eye|81745001|244486005
itself
while
antihelminth drugs|372802005
with steroids|116566001
alone|105529008
might
be
sufficient to|51117008
treat|395077000
cysts|441457006
outside globe.|81745001|244486005

Treatment recommendations|276239002|416118004
for subcutaneous cysticercosis|105684008|263887005|105684008
includes|55919000
surgery,|83578000
praziquantel|387310003
and
albendazole.[16]|387558006

In general, subcutaneous disease|60132005|64572001|60132005|263887005|64572001
does
not
need|410525008|103325001
specific therapy.|69658003|276239002

Painful|22253000
or
bothersome cysts|441457006
can
be
surgically|83578000
excised.

Cysticercosis|105684008
is
considered
as ?tools-ready disease?|86967005|64572001
according to WHO.

International Task Force|285653008
for Disease Eradication|64572001
in 1992
reported|229059009|223458004
that cysticercosis|105684008
is
potentially eradicable.

It
is
feasible
because
there
are
no animal|387961004
reservoirs|257687008
besides humans|278412004
and
pigs.|106996007|78678003

The only source|50607009|260753009|420295001|260753009
of _T.

solium_ infection
for pigs|106996007|78678003
is
from humans,|278412004
a definite host.|255545003

Theoretically,
breaking
the life cycle|224130005|44180009
seems
easy|36203004
by
doing
intervention strategies|225334002
from various stages|256220008|261612004
in the life cycle.[22]|224130005|44180009

For example,

The intervention strategies|225334002
to eradicate cysticercosis|105684008
includes|55919000
surveillance|225419007
of pigs|106996007|78678003
in foci|87017008
of transmission|258150004
and
massive chemotherapy treatment|46998006|416608005|276239002|46998006|416608005|416118004|46998006|367336001|276239002|46998006|367336001|416118004
of humans.|278412004

In reality,
control|31509003
of _T.

solium_
by a single intervention,|125681006|225334002|50607009|225334002
for instance,
by treating only human population|28995006|278412004|385436007|28995006|278412004|389109008
will
not
work|261041009
because
the existing infected pigs|106996007|78678003
can
still
carry|288345009
on the cycle.|44180009

The proposed strategy
for eradication
is
to do multilateral intervention|225334002
by treating|28995006
both
human|278412004
and
porcine populations.|106996007|385436007|78678003|385436007

It
is
feasible
because
treatment pigs|276239002|106996007|276239002|78678003|416118004|106996007|416118004|78678003
with oxfendazole|96112006
have
been
shown
to
be
effective|255403003|254648000
and
once
treated|28995006
,
they
are
protected
from further infections|46053002
for
at least 3 months.[24]|276139006|258706009|263796003|258706009

Even
with the concurrent treatment|68405009|276239002|68405009|416118004
of humans|278412004
and
pigs,|106996007|78678003
complete elimination|255594003|63911002
is
hard to|72505002
achieve.

In one study|421379005|110465008|421379005|224699009
conducted|844005
in 12 villages|224806006
in Peru,|223721003
both
humans|278412004
and
porcine|106996007|78678003
were
treated|28995006
with praziquantel|387310003
and
oxfendazole,|96112006
with the coverage
of more|242762006
than 75%
in humans|278412004
and
90%|264705001|264703008
in pigs [25]|106996007|78678003
The result|394617004
shows
a
decreased|1250004|260400001|260371004
in prevalence
and
incidence
in the intervention area|225334002|42798000
;
however
the effect|253861007
did
not completely
eliminate
_T.

solium_.

The possible reason|371930009|410666004|60022001|410666004
includes|55919000
the incomplete coverage|255599008|255609007
and
re-infection.|228877007

Even
though
_T.

solium_
could
be
eliminated
through mass treatment|300848003|276239002|300848003|416118004|118538004|276239002|118538004|416118004
of human|278412004
and
porcine population,|106996007|385436007|106996007|389109008|78678003|385436007|78678003|389109008
it
is
not sustainable.

Moreover,
both
tapeworm carriers|86133004|47461006|79501007|47461006
of humans|278412004
and
pigs|106996007|78678003
tend
to
spread|410677005
the disease|64572001
from endemic
to non-endemic areas|42798000
resulting|42752001
in periodic outbreaks|81591007|443684005
of cysticercosis|105684008
or
outbreaks|443684005
in new areas.[27][28]|7147002|42798000

Given|419582001
the fact
that pigs|106996007|78678003
are
part|260726005
of a life cycle,|224130005|44180009
vaccination
of pigs|106996007|78678003
is
another feasible intervention to|225334002
eliminate
cysticercosis.|105684008

Research studies|110465008|224699009
have
been
focusing|251776000
on vaccine|398827000
against cestode parasites,|79501007|37763007
since
many immune cell types|255386009|4421005|255386009|246238003
are
found|404684003
to
be
capable
of destroying cysticercus.|78167007

Many vaccine candidates|260396001|398827000
are
extracted|62972009
from antigens|7120007
of different cestodes|263735002|86133004|263735002|79501007
such as _T.

solium_,
_T.

crassiceps_,
_T.

saginata_,
_T.

ovis_|388254009
and
target oncospheres
and/or
cysticerci.|78167007

In 1983,
Molinari
et
al.

reported|229059009|223458004
the first vaccine candidate|255216001|398827000|232714002|398827000
against porcine cysticercosis|106996007|105684008|78678003|105684008
using|260676000
antigen|7120007
from cysticercus cellulosae|17966003
drawn
out
from naturally
infected.

Recently,|6493001
vaccines|398827000
extracted|62972009
from genetically engineered 45W-4B antigens|106269003|264684005|7120007
have
been
successfully
tested|272393004
to pigs|106996007|78678003
in an experimental condition.|260905004

This type|261664005
of vaccine|398827000
can
protect
against cysticercosis|105684008
in
both
Chinese|297876005|33897005
and
Mexican type|261664005
of _T.

solium_.

However,
it
has
not
been
tested|272393004
in endemic field conditions,|255798002|260905004
which
is
important
because
the realistic condition|260905004
in the field|52101004|255798002|18720000|255798002
differ
greatly
from experimental condition,|260905004
and
this
can
result|394617004
in a great difference|255509001|263735002|263768009|263735002
in the chances
of infection
and
immune reaction.[29]|255386009|263851003

The vaccine|398827000
constituted
by 3 peptide synthetically|260313008|52642002
produced
(S3Pvac
)
has
proven|277025001
its efficacy
in natural conditions|510009|260905004
of transmission.|258150004

The S3PVAC vaccine|398827000
so
far,|46053002
can
be
considered
as the best vaccine candidate to|398827000
be
used|394850002
in endemic areas|42798000
such as Mexico|223687006
(20
).

S3Pvac
consists
of three protective peptides|421291004|52642002
:
KETc12,
KETc1
and
GK1,
whose
sequences|72633008
belong
to native antigens|263818007|7120007
that
are
present|52101004|246105001
in the different developmental stages|263735002|278923009|261612004
of _T.

solium_
and
other cestode parasites.[29][33]|74964007|79501007|37763007|264667004

Non-infected pigs|55189008|106996007|55189008|78678003
from rural villages|224806006
in Mexico|223687006
were
vaccinated
with S3Pvac
and
the vaccine|398827000
reduced|260400001
98%
the number|410680006|410681005
of cysticerci|78167007
and
50%
the number|410680006|410681005
of prevalence.

The diagnostic method|103693007
involves|248448006
necropsy|168461002
and
tongue inspection|21974007|32750006|181226008|32750006
of pigs.|106996007|78678003

The natural challenge conditions|510009|260905004
used|394850002
in the study|110465008|224699009
proved|277025001
the efficacy
of the S3Pvac vaccine|398827000
in transmission control|258150004|31509003
of _T.

solium_
in Mexico.|223687006

The S3Pvac vaccine|398827000
is
owned
by the National Autonomous University of Mexico|72167002|224871002|223687006
and
the method|260686004|272394005
of high scale production|75540009|19892000|75540009|278111002|371879000|19892000|371879000|278111002
of the vaccine|398827000
has
already
been
developed.

The validation
of the vaccine|398827000
in agreement
with the Secretary|308204000
of Animal Health|387961004|263775005
in Mexico|223687006
is
currently|15240007
in the process|415178003
of completion.|255594003

It
is
also
hoped
that
the vaccine|398827000
will
be
well-accepted|20572008|385645004
by pig owners|78678003|388393002|388392007
because
they also
lose
their income
if
pigs|106996007|78678003
are
infected
cysticercosis.|105684008

Vaccination
of pigs|106996007|78678003
against cysticercosis,|105684008
if
succeeded
,
can
potentially
have
a great impact|255509001|134293005|263768009|134293005
on transmission control|258150004|31509003
since
there
is
no chance
of re-infection|228877007
once pigs|106996007|78678003
receive
vaccination.

Even
though
vaccines|398827000
have
been
successfully
generated
,
the feasibility
of its production
and
usage|277889008
in rural free ranging pigs still|37837009|106996007|37837009|78678003
remains
a challenge.

If
a vaccine|398827000
is
to
be
injected|422145002
,
the burden
of work|261041009
and
the cost
of vaccine administration|398827000|413454004|398827000|416118004
to pigs|106996007|78678003
will
remain
high|75540009|371879000
and
unrealistic.

The incentives
of
using|260676000
vaccines|398827000
by pig owners|78678003|388393002|388392007
will
decrease|260400001|260370003
if
the vaccine administration|398827000|413454004|398827000|416118004
to pigs|106996007|78678003
takes|419652001
time|410669006
by injecting|422145002
every single pig|125681006|78678003|125681006|388393002|125681006|388392007|50607009|78678003|50607009|388393002|50607009|388392007
in their livestock.

A hypothetical oral vaccine|260548002|398827000
is
proposed to
be
more effective|242762006|255403003|242762006|254648000
in this case|398241000
as
it
can
be
easily|36203004
delivered
to the pigs|106996007|78678003
by food.[29]|255620007

Cysticercosis|105684008
can
also
be
prevented|116699007
by routine inspection|50811001|32750006
of meat|28647000
and
condemnation
of measly meat|14189004|28647000
by the local government.|255470001

However,
in areas|42798000
where food|255620007
is
scarce, cyst-infected meat|441457006|28647000|103552005|28647000
might
be
considered
as
wasted
since
pork|226934003
can
provide
high quality protein.|75540009|263496004|88878007|371879000|263496004|88878007

At times,|410669006|417929005
infected pigs|106996007|78678003
are
consumed
within the locality|255470001
or
sold
at low prices|62482003|371880002
to traffickers
who
take|419652001
the uninspected pigs|106996007|78678003
at urban areas|224807002|42798000
for sale.[38]|264670000

Due to these limitations,|246175000
cysticercosis|105684008
has
not
been
eliminated
in any endemic areas.|42798000

The tapeworm|86133004|79501007
that
causes|134198009
cysticercosis|105684008
is
endemic
to many parts|260726005
of the world
including|55919000
China,|223581004
Southeast Asia,|223585008
India,|223600005
sub-Saharan Africa,|409988000
and
Latin America.

Some studies|110465008|224699009
suggest
that
the prevalence
of cysticercosis|105684008
in Mexico|223687006
is
between 3.1|260313008
and
3.9 percent.|260282009|118582008

Other studies|74964007|110465008|74964007|224699009
have
found|404684003
the seroprevalence
in areas|42798000
of Guatemala,|223693003
Bolivia,|223714003
and
Peru|223721003
as high|75540009|371879000
as 20 percent|118582008
in humans,|278412004
and
37 percent|118582008
in pigs.|106996007|78678003

In Ethiopia,|223517008
Kenya|223534000
and
the Democratic Republic
of Congo|223524009
around 10%
of the population|385436007|389109008
is
infected,
in Madagascar 16%.|223535004

The frequency|260864003|272123002
has
decreased|1250004|260400001|260371004
in developed countries|223369002
owing to stricter meat inspection,|28647000|32750006
better hygiene|3442003|284779002
and
better sanitary facilities.|3442003

The distribution|255464007
of cysticercosis coincides|105684008
with the distribution|255464007
of _T.

solium_.

Cysticercosis|105684008
is
the most common cause|4757001|72906007|134198009
of symptomatic epilepsy worldwide.[42]|264931009|313307000

In Latin America,
an estimated 75 million persons|414135002|125676002
live|419749002
in endemic areas|42798000
and
400,000 people|125676002
have
symptomatic disease.|264931009|64572001

Cysticercosis|105684008
is
also
found|404684003
to
be
associated|47429007
with Hispanic ethnicity,|414408004|397731000
immigrant status,|161158003|263490005
and
exposure|71677004|24932003
to areas|42798000
of endemicity.

In the
US,
the disease|64572001
is
found|404684003
in immigrants|161158003
from Mexico,|223687006
Central|26216008
and
South America.|223504005

Current livestock|15240007
for pigs|106996007|78678003
in the U.S|223688001
do
not
play|300776002
a role
in the transmission|258150004
of _Taenia solium_,|17966003
and
thus cysticercosis|105684008
in the U.S|223688001
is
an imported disease.[22]|64572001

In the USA|223688001
during 1990?2002,
221 cysticercosis deaths|105684008|419620001|105684008|268923008
were
identified.|7882003

Mortality rates|409651001
were
highest|75540009|371879000
for Latinos
and
men.|339947000

The mean age|255586005|424144002
at death|419620001|268923008
was
40.5 years|259031006|258707000
(range 2?88
).

Most patients,|116154003
84.6%,
were
foreign born,|106970005|81827009|398209006
and
62%
had
emigrated
from Mexico.|223687006

The 33|264667004
US-born persons|125676002
who
died|419620001|419099009
of cysticercosis|105684008
represented
15%
of all cysticercosis-related deaths.|105684008|272151006|419620001|105684008|272151006|268923008|105684008|262094002|419620001|105684008|262094002|268923008

The cysticercosis mortality rate|105684008|409651001
was
highest|75540009|371879000
in California,|224043007|25997004
which
accounted
for ?60%
of all deaths.[44]|419620001|268923008
